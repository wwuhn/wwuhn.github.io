TRADERS-... With psychohistoric inevitability. economic control of theFoundation grew. The traders grew rich; and with riches came power....<br />
It is sometimes forgotten that Hober Mallow began life as an ordinarytrader. It is never forgotten that he ended it as the first of the MerchantPrinces....<br />
ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICAJorane Sutt put the tips of carefully-manicured fingers together and said,&quot;It's something of a puzzle. In fact--and this is in the strictest ofconfidence-- it may be another one of Hari Seldon's crises.&quot;The man opposite felt in the pocket of his short Smyrnian jacket for acigarette. &quot;Don't know about that, Sutt. As a general rule, politiciansstart shouting 'Seldon crisis' at every mayoralty campaign.&quot;Sutt smiled very faintly, &quot;I'm not campaigning, Mallow. We're facingnuclear weapons, and we don't know where they're coming from.&quot;Hober Mallow of Smyrno, Master Trader, smoked quietly, almostindifferently. &quot;Go on. If you have more to say, get it out.&quot; Mallow nevermade the mistake of being overpolite to a Foundation man. He might be anOutlander, but a man's a man for a?that.<br />
Sutt indicated the trimensional star-map on the table. He adjusted thecontrols and a cluster of some half-dozen stellar systems blazed red.<br />
'That,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;is the Korellian Republic.&quot;The trader nodded, &quot;I've been there. Stinking rathole! I suppose you cancall it a republic but it's always someone out of the Argo family that getselected Commdor each time. And if you ever don't like it--things happen toyou.&quot; He twisted his lip and repeated, &quot;I've been there.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you've come back, which hasn't always happened. Three trade ships,inviolate under the Conventions, have disappeared within the territory ofthe Republic in the last year. And those ships were armed with all the usual nuclear explosives and force-field defenses.&quot;<br />
&quot;What was the last word heard from the ships?&quot;<br />
&quot;Routine reports. Nothing else.&quot;<br />
&quot;What did Korell say?&quot;Sutt's eyes gleamed sardonically, &quot;There was no way of asking. TheFoundation's greatest asset throughout the Periphery is its reputation ofpower. Do you think we can lose three ships and ask for them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then, suppose you tell me what you want with me.&quot;Jorane Sutt did not waste his time in the luxury of annoyance. As secretaryto the mayor, he had held off opposition councilmen, jobseekers, reformers,and crackpots who claimed to have solved in its entirety the course offuture history as worked out by Hari Seldon. With training like that, ittook a good deal to disturb him.<br />
He said methodically, &quot;In a moment. You see, three ships lost in the samesector in the same year can't be accident, and nuclear power can beconquered only by more nuclear power. The question automatically arises: ifKorell has nuclear weapons, where is it getting them?&quot;<br />
&quot;And where does it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Two alternatives. Either the Korellians have constructed them themselves?<br />
&quot;Far-fetched!&quot;<br />
&quot;Very! But the other possibility is that we are being afflicted with a caseof treason.&quot;<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Mallow's voice was cold.<br />
The secretary said calmly, &quot;There's nothing miraculous about thepossibility. Since the Four Kingdoms accepted the Foundation Convention, wehave had to deal with considerable groups of dissident populations in eachnation. Each former kingdom has its pretenders and its former noblemen, whocan't very well pretend to love the Foundation. Some of them are becomingactive, perhaps.&quot;Mallow was a dull red. &quot;I see. Is there anything you want to say to me? I'ma Smyrnian.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. You're a Smyrnian-- born in Smyrno, one of the former FourKingdoms. You're a Foundation man by education only. By birth, you're anOutlander and a foreigner. No doubt your grandfather was a baron at thetime of the wars with Anacreon and Loris, and no doubt your family estateswere taken away when Sef Sermak redistributed the land.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, by Black Space, no! My grandfather was a blood-poor son-of-a-spacerwho died heaving coal at starving wages before the Foundation took over. Iowe nothing to the old regime. But I was born in Smyrno, and I'm notashamed of either Smyrno or Smyrnians, by the Galaxy. Your sly little hintsof treason aren't going to panic me into licking Foundation spittle. Andnow you can either give your orders or make your accusations. I don't carewhich.&quot;<br />
&quot;My good Master Trader, I don't care an electron whether your grandfatherwas King of Smyrno or the greatest pauper on the planet. I recited thatrigmarole about your birth and ancestry to show you that I'm not interestedin them. Evidently, you missed the point. Let's go back now. You're aSmyrnian. You know the Outlanders. Also, you're a trader and one of thebest. You've been to Korell and you know the Korellians. That's whereyou've got to go.&quot;Mallow breathed deeply, &quot;As a spy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all. As a trader--but with your eyes open. If you can find outwhere the power is coming from--I might remind you, since you're aSmyrnian, that two of those lost trade ships had Smyrnian crews.&quot;<br />
&quot;When do I start?&quot;<br />
&quot;When will your ship be ready?&quot;<br />
&quot;In six days.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then that's when you start. You'll have all the details at the Admiralty.&quot;<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; The trader rose, shook hands roughly, and strode out.<br />
Sutt waited, spreading his fingers gingerly and rubbing out the pressure;then shrugged his shoulders and stepped into the mayor's office.<br />
The mayor deadened the visiplate and leaned back. &quot;What do you make of it,Sutt?&quot;<br />
&quot;He could be a good actor,&quot; said Sutt, and stared thoughtfully ahead.<br />
2<br />
It was evening of the same day, and in Jorane Sutt's bachelor apartment onthe twenty-first floor of the Hardin Building, Publis Manlio was sippingwine slowly.<br />
It was Publis Manlio in whose slight, aging body were fulfilled two greatoffices of the Foundation. He was Foreign Secretary in the mayor's cabinet,and to all the outer suns, barring only the Foundation itself, he was, inaddition, Primate of the Church, Purveyor of the Holy Food, Master of theTemples, and so forth almost indefinitely in confusing but sonoroussyllables.<br />
He was saying, &quot;But he agreed to let you send out that trader. It is apoint.&quot;<br />
&quot;But such a small one,&quot; said Sutt. &quot;It gets us nothing immediately. Thewhole business is the crudest sort of stratagem, since we have no way offoreseeing it to the end. It is a mere paying out of rope on the chancethat somewhere along the length of it will be a noose.&quot;<br />
&quot;True. And this Mallow is a capable man. What if he is not an easy prey todupery?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is a chance that must be run. If there is treachery, it is thecapable men that are implicated. If not, we need a capable man to detectthe truth. And Mallow will be guarded. Your glass is empty.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, thanks. I've had enough.&quot;Sutt filled his own glass and patiently endured the other's uneasy reverie.<br />
Of whatever the reverie consisted, it ended indecisively, for the primatesaid suddenly, almost explosively, &quot;Sutt, what's on your mind?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll tell you, Manlio.&quot; His thin lips parted, &quot;We're in the middle of aSeldon crisis.&quot;Manlio stared, then said softly, &quot;How do you know? Has Seldon appeared inthe Time Vault again?&quot;<br />
&quot;That much, my friend, is not necessary. Look, reason it out. Since theGalactic Empire abandoned the Periphery, and threw us on our own, we havenever had an opponent who possessed nuclear power. Now, for the first time,we have one. That seems significant even if it stood by itself. And itdoesn't. For the first time in over seventy years, we are facing a majordomestic political crisis. I should think the synchronization of the twocrises, inner and outer, puts it beyond all doubt.&quot;Manlio's eyes narrowed, &quot;If that's all, it's not enough. There have beentwo Seldon crises so far, and both times the Foundation was in danger ofextermination. Nothing can be a third crisis till that danger returns.&quot;Sutt never showed impatience, &quot;That danger is coming. Any fool can tell acrisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it inembryo. Look, Manlio, we're proceeding along a planned history. We knowthat Hari Seldon worked out the historical probabilities of the future. Weknow that some day we're to rebuild the Galactic Empire. We know that itwill take a thousand years or thereabouts. And we know that in the intervalwe will face certain definite crises.<br />
&quot;Now the first crisis came fifty years after the establishment of theFoundation, and the second, thirty years later than that. Almostseventy-five years have gone since. It's time, Manlio, it's time.&quot;Manlio rubbed his nose uncertainly, &quot;And you've made your plans to meetthis crisis?&quot;Sutt nodded.<br />
&quot;And I,&quot; continued Manlio, &quot;am to play a part in it?&quot;Sutt nodded again, &quot;Before we can meet the foreign threat of atomic power,we've got to put our own house in order. These traders?<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; The primate stiffened, and his eyes grew sharp.<br />
&quot;That's right. These traders. They are useful, but they are too strong--<br />
and too uncontrolled. They are Outlanders, educated apart from religion. Onthe one hand, we put knowledge into their hands, and on the other, weremove our strongest hold upon them.&quot;<br />
&quot;If we can prove treachery?&quot;<br />
&quot;If we could, direct action would be simple and sufficient. But thatdoesn't signify in the least. Even if treason among them did not exist,they would form an uncertain element in our society. They wouldn't be boundto us by patriotism or common descent, or even by religious awe. Undertheir secular leadership, the outer provinces, which, since Hardin's time,look to us as the Holy Planet, might break away.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see all that, but the cure?<br />
&quot;The cure must come quickly, before the Seldon Crisis becomes acute. Ifnuclear weapons are without and disaffection within, the odds might be toogreat.&quot; Sutt put down the empty glass he had been fingering, &quot;This isobviously your job.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mine?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can't do it. My office is appointive and has no legislative standing.&quot;<br />
&quot;The mayor?<br />
&quot;Impossible. His personality is entirely negative. He is energetic only inevading responsibility. But if an independent party arose that mightendanger re-election, he might allow himself to be led.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, Sutt, I lack the aptitude for practical politics.&quot;<br />
&quot;Leave that to me. Who knows, Manlio? Since Salvor Hardin's time, theprimacy and the mayoralty have never been combined in a single person. Butit might happen now--if your job were well done.&quot;<br />
3<br />
And at the other end of town, in homelier surroundings, Hober Mallow kept asecond appointment. He had listened long, and now he said cautiously, &quot;Yes,I've heard of your campaigns to get trader representation in the council.<br />
But why me, Twer?&quot;Jaim Twer, who would remind you any time, asked or unasked, that he was inthe first group of Outlanders to receive a lay education at the Foundation,beamed.<br />
&quot;I know what I'm doing,&quot; he said. &quot;Remember when I met you first, lastyear.&quot;<br />
&quot;At the Trader's Convention.&quot;<br />
&quot;Right. You ran the meeting. You had those red-necked oxen planted in theirseats, then put them in your shirtpocket and walked off with them. Andyou're all right with the Foundation masses, too. You've got glamor--or,at any rate, solid adventure-publicity, which is the same thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; said Mallow, dryly. &quot;But why now?&quot;'Because now's our chance. Do you know that the Secretary of Education hashanded in his resignation? It's not out in the open yet, but it will be.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;That-- never mind? He waved a disgusted hand. &quot;It's so. The Actionistparty is splitting wide open, and we can murder it right now on a straightquestion of equal rights for traders; or, rather, democracy, pro- andanti-.&quot;Mallow lounged back in his chair and stared at his thick fingers, &quot;Uh-uh.<br />
Sorry, Twer. I'm leaving next week on business. You'll have to get someoneelse.&quot;Twer stared, &quot;Business? What kind of business?&quot;<br />
&quot;Very super-secret. Triple-A priority. All that, you know. Had a talk withthe mayor's own secretary.&quot;<br />
&quot;Snake Sutt?&quot; Jaim Twer grew excited. &quot;A trick. The son-of-a-spacer isgetting rid of you. Mallow?<br />
&quot;Hold on!&quot; Mallow's hand fell on the other's balled fist. &quot;Don't go into ablaze. If it's a trick, I'll be back some day for the reckoning. if itisn't, your snake, Sutt, is playing into our hands. Listen, there's aSeldon crisis coming up.&quot;Mallow waited for a reaction but it never came. Twer merely stared. &quot;What'sa Seldon crisis?&quot;<br />
&quot;Galaxy!&quot; Mallow exploded angrily at the anticlimax, &quot;What the blue blazesdid you do when you went to school? What do you mean anyway by a foolquestion like that?&quot;The elder man frowned, &quot;If you'll explain?<br />
There was a long pause, then, &quot;I'll explain.&quot; Mallow's eyebrows lowered,and he spoke slowly. &quot;When the Galactic Empire began to die at the edges,and when the ends of the Galaxy reverted to barbarism and dropped away,Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists planted a colony, the Foundation,out here in the middle of the mess, so that we could incubate art, science,and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, yes?<br />
&quot;I'm not finished,&quot; said the trader, coldly. &quot;The future course of theFoundation was plotted according to the science of psychohistory, thenhighly developed, and conditions arranged so as to bring about a series ofcrises that will force us most rapidly along the route to future Empire.<br />
Each crisis, each Seldon crisis, marks an epoch in our history. We'reapproaching one now--our third.&quot;Twer shrugged. &quot;I suppose this was mentioned in school, but I've been outof school a long time--longer than you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose so. Forget it. What matters is that I'm being sent out into themiddle of the development of this crisis. There's no telling what I'll havewhen I come back, and there is a council election every year.&quot;Twer looked up, &quot;Are you on the track of anything?&quot;<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have definite plans?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not the faintest inkling of one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well?<br />
&quot;Well, nothing. Hardin once said: 'To succeed, planning alone isinsufficient. One must improvise as well.' I'll improvise.&quot;Twer shook his head uncertainly, and they stood, looking at each other.<br />
Mallow said, quite suddenly, but quite matter-of-factly, &quot;I tell you what,how about coming with me? Don't stare, man. You've been a trader before youdecided them was more excitement in politics. Or so I've heard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where are you going? Tell me that.&quot;Towards the Whassallian Rift. I can't be more specific till we're out inspace. What do you say?&quot;Suppose Sutt decides he wants me where he can see&quot;Not likely. If he's anxious to get rid of me, why not of you as well?<br />
Besides which, no trader would hit space if he couldn't pick his own crew.<br />
I take whom I please.&quot;There was a queer glint in the older man's eyes, &quot;All right. I'll go.&quot; Heheld out his hand, &quot;It'll be my first trip in three years.&quot;Mallow grasped and shook the other's hand, &quot;Good! All fired good! And nowI've got to round up the boys. You know where the Far Star docks, don 'tyou? Then show up tomorrow. Good-by.&quot;<br />

Korell is that frequent phenomenon in history: the republic whose ruler hasevery attribute of the absolute monarch but the name. It therefore enjoyedthe usual despotism unrestrained even by those two moderating influences inthe legitimate monarchies: regal &quot;honor&quot; and court etiquette.<br />
Materially, its prosperity was low. The day of the Galactic Empire haddeparted, with nothing but silent memorials and broken structures totestify to it. The day of the Foundation had not yet come-- and in thefierce determination of its ruler, the Commdor Asper Argo, with his strictregulation of the traders and his stricter prohibition of the missionaries,it was never coming.<br />
The spaceport itself was decrepit and decayed, and the crew of the Far Starwere drearily aware of that. The moldering hangars made for a molderingatmosphere and Jaim Twer itched and fretted over a game of solitaire.<br />
Hober Mallow said thoughtfully, &quot;Good trading material here.&quot; He wasstaring quietly out the viewport. So far, there was little else to be saidabout Korell. The trip here was uneventful. The squadron of Korellian shipsthat had shot out to intercept the Far Star had been tiny, limping relicsof ancient glory or battered, clumsy hulks. They had maintained theirdistance fearfully, and still maintained it, and for a week now, Mallow'srequests for an audience with the local go government had been unanswered.<br />
Mallow repeated, &quot;Good trading here. You might call this virgin territory.&quot;Jaim Twer looked up impatiently, and threw his cards aside, &quot;What the devildo you intend doing, Mallow? The crew's grumbling, the officers areworried, and I’m wondering?<br />
&quot;Wondering? About what?&quot;<br />
&quot;About the situation. And about you. What are we doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Waiting.&quot;The old trader snorted and grew red. He growled, &quot;You're going it blind,Mallow. There's a guard around the field and there are ships overhead.<br />
Suppose they're getting ready to blow us into a hole in the ground.&quot;<br />
&quot;They've had a week.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe they're waiting for reinforcements.&quot; Twer's eyes were sharp andhard.<br />
Mallow sat down abruptly, &quot;Yes, I'd thought of that You see, it poses apretty problem. First, we got here without trouble. That may mean nothing,however, for only three ships out of better than three hundred wenta-glimmer last year. The percentage is low. But that may mean also that thenumber of their ships equipped with nuclear power is small, and that theydare not expose them needlessly, until that number grows.<br />
&quot;But it could mean, on the other hand, that they haven't nuclear powerafter all. Or maybe they have and are keeping undercover, for fear we knowsomething. It's one thing, after all, to piratize blundering, light-armedmerchant ships. It's another to fool around with an accredited envoy of theFoundation when the mere fact of his presence may mean the Foundation isgrowing suspicious.<br />
&quot;Combine this?<br />
&quot;Hold on, Mallow, hold on.&quot; Twer raised his hands. &quot;You're just aboutdrowning me with talk. What're you getting at? Never mind the in-betweens.&quot;<br />
&quot;You've got to have the in-betweens, or you won't understand, Twer. We'reboth waiting. They don't know what I'm doing here and I don't know whatthey've got here. But I'm in the weaker position because I'm one andthey're an entire world--maybe with atomic power. I can't afford to be theone to weaken. Sure it's dangerous. Sure there may be a hole in the groundwaiting for us. But we knew that from the start. What else is there to do?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't?Who's that, now?&quot;Mallow looked up patiently, and tuned the receiver. The visiplate glowedinto the craggy face of the watch sergeant.<br />
&quot;Speak, sergeant.&quot;The sergeant said, &quot;Pardon, sir. The men have given entry to a Foundationmissionary.&quot;<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Mallow's face grew livid.<br />
&quot;A missionary, sit. He's in need of hospitalization, sir-&quot;<br />
&quot;There'll be more than one in need of that, sergeant, for this piece ofwork. Order the men to battle stations.&quot;Crew's lounge was almost empty. Five minutes after the order, even the menon the off-shift were at their guns. It was speed that was the great virtuein the anarchic regions of the interstellar space of the Periphery, and itwas in speed above all that the crew of a master trader excelled.<br />
Mallow entered slowly, and stared the missionary up and down and around.<br />
His eye slid to Lieutenant Tinter, who shifted uneasily to one side and toWatch-Sergeant Demen, whose blank face and stolid figure flanked the other.<br />
The Master Trader turned to Twer and paused thoughtfully, &quot;Well, then,Twer, get the officers here quietly, except for the co-ordinators and thetrajectorian. The men are to remain at stations till further orders.&quot;There was a five-minute hiatus, in which Mallow kicked open the doors tothe lavatories, looked behind the bar, pulled the draperies across thethick windows. For half a minute he left the room altogether, and when hereturned he was humming abstractedly.<br />
Men filed in. Twer followed, and closed the door silently.<br />
Mallow said quietly, &quot;First, who let this man in without orders from me?&quot;The watch sergeant stepped forward. Every eye shifted. &quot;Pardon, sir. It wasno definite person. It was a sort of mutual agreement. He was one of us,you might say, and these foreigners here?<br />
Mallow cut him short, &quot;I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant, andunderstand them. These men, were they under your command?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
&quot;When this is over, they're to be confined to individual quarters for aweek. You yourself are relieved of all supervisory duties for a similarperiod. Understood?&quot;The sergeant's face never changed, but there was the slightest droop to hisshoulders. He said, crisply, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
&quot;You may leave. Get to your gun-station.&quot;The door closed behind him and the babble rose.<br />
Twer broke in, &quot;Why the punishment, Mallow? You know that these Korellianskill captured missionaries.&quot;<br />
&quot;An action against my orders is bad in itself whatever other reasons theremay be in its favor. No one was to leave or enter the ship withoutpermission.&quot;Lieutenant Tinter murmured rebelliously, &quot;Seven days without action. Youcan't maintain discipline that way.&quot;Mallow said icily, &quot;I can. There's no merit in discipline under idealcircumstances. I'll have it in the face of death, or it's useless. Where'sthis missionary? Get him here in front of me.&quot;The trader sat down, while the scarlet-cloaked figure was carefully broughtforward.<br />
&quot;What's your name, reverend?&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; The scarlet-robed figure wheeled towards Mallow, the whole bodyturning as a unit. His eyes were blankly open and there was a bruise on onetemple. He had not spoken, nor, as far as Mallow could tell, moved duringall the previous interval.<br />
&quot;Your name, revered one?&quot;The missionary started to sudden feverish life. His arms went out in anembracing gesture. &quot;My son-- my children. May you always be in theprotecting arms of the Galactic Spirit.&quot;Twer stepped forward, eyes troubled, voice husky, &quot;The man's sick. Take himto bed, somebody. Order him to bed, Mallow, and have him seen to. He'sbadly hurt.&quot;Mallow's great arm shoved him back, &quot;Don't interfere, Twer, or I'll haveyou out of the room. Your name, revered one?&quot;The missionary's hands clasped in sudden supplication, &quot;As you areenlightened men, save me from the heathen.&quot; The words tumbled out, &quot;Save mefrom these brutes and darkened ones who raven after me and would afflictthe Galactic Spirit with their crimes. I am Jord Parma, of the Anacreonianworlds. Educated at the Foundation; the Foundation itself, my children. Iam a Priest of the Spirit educated into all the mysteries, who have come here where the inner voice called me.&quot; He was gasping. &quot;I have suffered atthe hands of the unenlightened. As you are Children of the Spirit; and in the name of that Spirit, protect me from them.&quot;A voice broke in upon them, as the emergency alarm box clamored metallically:<br />
&quot;Enemy units in sight! Instruction desired!&quot;Every eye shot mechanically upward to the speaker.<br />
Mallow swore violently. He clicked open the reverse and yelled, &quot;Maintainvigil! That is all!&quot; and turned it off.<br />
He made his way to the thick drapes that rustled aside at a touch andstared grimly out,Enemy units! Several thousands of them in the persons of the individualmembers of a Korellian mob. The rolling rabble encompassed the port fromextreme end to extreme end, and in the cold, hard light of magnesium flaresthe foremost straggled closer.<br />
&quot;Tinter!&quot; The trader never turned, but the back of his neck was red. &quot;Getthe outer speaker working and find out what they want. Ask if they have arepresentative of the law with them. Make no promises and no threats, orI'll kill you.&quot;Tinter turned and left.<br />
Mallow felt a rough hand on his shoulder and he struck it aside. It wasTwer. His voice was an angry hiss in his ear, &quot;Mallow, you're bound to holdonto this man. There's no way of maintaining decency and honor otherwise.<br />
He's of the Foundation and, after all, he-- is a priest. These savagesoutside?Do you hear me?&quot;<br />
&quot;I hear you, Twer.&quot; Mallow's voice was incisive. &quot;I've got more to do herethan guard missionaries. I'll do, sir, what I please, and, by Seldon andall the Galaxy, if you try to stop me, I'll tear out your stinkingwindpipe. Don't get in my way, Twer, or it will be the last of you.&quot;He turned and strode past. &quot;You! Revered Parma! Did you know that, byconvention, no Foundation missionaries may enter the Korellian territory?&quot;The missionary was trembling, &quot;I can but go where the Spirit leads, my son.<br />
If the darkened ones refuse enlightenment, is it not the greater sign oftheir need for it?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's outside the question, revered one. You are here against the law ofboth Korell and the Foundation. I cannot in law protect you.&quot;The missionary's hands were raised again. His earlier bewilderment wasgone. There was the raucous clamor of the ship's outer communication systemin action, and the faint, undulating gabble of the angry horde in response.<br />
The sound made his eyes wild.<br />
&quot;You hear them? Why do you talk of law to me, of a law made by men? Thereare higher laws. Was it not the Galactic Spirit that said: Thou shalt notstand idly by to the hurl of thy fellowman. And has he not said: Even asthou dealest with the humble and defenseless, thus shalt thou be dealtwith.<br />
&quot;Have you not guns? Have you not a ship? And behind you is there not theFoundation? And above and all-about you is there not the Spirit that rulesthe universe?&quot; He paused for breath.<br />
And then the great outer voice of the Far Star ceased and Lieutenant Tinterwas back, troubled.<br />
&quot;Speak!&quot; said Mallow, shortly.<br />
&quot;Sir, they demand the person of Jord Parma.&quot;<br />
&quot;If not?&quot;<br />
&quot;There are various threats, sir. It is difficult to make much out. Thereare so many--and they seem quite mad. There is someone who says he governsthe district and has police powers, but he is quite evidently not his ownmaster.&quot;<br />
&quot;Master or not,&quot; shrugged Mallow, &quot;he is the law. Tell them that if thisgovernor, or policeman, or whatever he is, approaches the ship alone, hecan have the Revered Jord Parma.&quot;And there was suddenly a gun in his hand. He added, &quot;I don't know whatinsubordination is. I have never had any experience with it. But if there'sanyone here who thinks he can teach me, I'd like to teach him my antidotein return.''<br />
The gun swiveled slowly, and rested on Twer. With an effort, the oldtrader's face untwisted and his hands unclenched and lowered. His breathwas a harsh rasp in his nostrils.<br />
Tinter left, and in five minutes a puny figure detached itself from thecrowd. It approached slowly and hesitantly, plainly drenched in fear andapprehension. Twice it turned back, and twice the patently obvious threatsof the many-headed monster urged him on.<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Mallow gestured with the hand-blaster, which remainedunsheathed. &quot;Grun and Upshur, take him out.&quot;The missionary screeched. He raised his arms and rigid fingers spearedupward as the voluminous sleeves fell away to reveal the thin, veined arms.<br />
There was a momentary, tiny flash of light that came and went in a breath.<br />
Mallow blinked and gestured again, contemptuously.<br />
The missionary's voice poured out as he struggled in the two-fold grasp,&quot;Cursed be the traitor who abandons his fellowman to evil and to death.<br />
Deafened be the ears that are deaf to the pleadings of the helpless. Blindbe the eyes that are blind to innocence. Blackened forever be the soul thatconsorts with blackness?<br />
Twer clamped his hands tightly over his ears.<br />
Mallow flipped his blaster and put it away. &quot;Disperse,&quot; he said, evenly,&quot;to respective stations. Maintain full vigil for six hours after dispersionof crowd. Double stations for forty-eight hours thereafter. Furtherinstructions at that time. Twer, come with me.&quot;They were alone in Mallow's private quarters. Mallow indicated a chair andTwer sat down. His stocky figure looked shrunken.<br />
Mallow stared him down, sardonically. &quot;Twer,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm disappointed.<br />
Your three years in politics seem to have gotten you out of trader habits.<br />
Remember, I may be a democrat back at the Foundation, but there's nothingshort of tyranny that can run my ship the way I want it run. I never had topull a blaster on my men before, and I wouldn't have had to now, if youhadn't gone out of line.<br />
&quot;Twer, you have no official position, but you're here on my invitation, andI'll extend you every courtesy--in private. However, from now on, in thepresence of my officers or men, I'm 'sir,' and not 'Mallow.' And when Igive an order, you'll jump faster than a third-class recruit just for luck,or I'll have you handcuffed in the sub-level even faster. Understand?&quot;The party-leader swallowed dryly. He said, reluctantly, &quot;My apologies.&quot;<br />
&quot;Accepted! Will you shake?&quot;Twer's limp fingers were swallowed in Mallow's huge palm. Twer said, &quot;Mymotives were good. It's difficult to send a man out to be lynched. Thatwobbly-kneed governor or whatever-he-was can't save him. It's murder.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can't help that. Frankly, the incident smelled too bad. Didn't younotice?&quot;<br />
&quot;Notice what?&quot;<br />
&quot;This spaceport is deep in the middle of a sleepy far section. Suddenly amissionary escapes. Where from? He comes here. Coincidence? A huge crowdgathers. From where? The nearest city of any size must be at least ahundred miles away. But they arrive in half an hour. How?&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot; echoed Twer.<br />
&quot;Well, what if the missionary were brought here and released as bait. Ourfriend, Revered Parma, was considerably confused. He seemed at no time tobe in complete possession of his wits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hard usage? murmured Twer bitterly.<br />
&quot;Maybe! And maybe the idea was to have us go all chivalrous and gallant,into a stupid defense of the man. He was here against the laws of Korelland the Foundation. If I withhold him, it is an act of war against Korell,and the Foundation would have no legal right to defend us.&quot;<br />
&quot;That--that's pretty far-fetched.&quot;The speaker blared and forestalled Mallow's answer: &quot;Sir, officialcommunication received.&quot;<br />
&quot;Submit immediately!&quot;The gleaming cylinder arrived in its slot with a click. Mallow opened itand shook out the silver-impregnated sheet it held. He rubbed itappreciatively between thumb and finger and said, &quot;Teleported direct fromthe capital. Commdor's own stationery.&quot;He read it in a glance and laughed shortly, &quot;So my idea was far-fetched,was it?&quot;He tossed it to Twer, and added, &quot;Half an hour after we hand back themissionary, we finally get a very polite invitation to the Commdor's augustpresence--after seven days of previous waiting. I think we passed a test.&quot;<br />
5<br />
Commdor Asper was a man of the people, by self-acclamation. His remainingback-fringe of gray hair drooped limply to his shoulders, his shirt neededlaundering, and he spoke with a snuffle.<br />
&quot;There is no ostentation here, Trader Mallow,&quot; he said. &quot;No false show. Inme, you see merely the first citizen of the state. That's what Commdormeans, and that's the only title I have.&quot;He seemed inordinately pleased with it all, &quot;in fact, I consider that factone of the strongest bonds between Korell and your nation. I understand youpeople enjoy the republican blessings we do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly, Commdor,&quot; said Mallow gravely, taking mental exception to thecomparison, &quot;an argument which I consider strongly in favor of continuedpeace and friendship between our governments.&quot;<br />
&quot;Peace! Ah!&quot; The Commdor's sparse gray beard twitched to the sentimentalgrimaces of his face. &quot;I don't think there is anyone in the Periphery whohas so near his heart the ideal of Peace, as I have. I can truthfully saythat since I succeeded my illustrious father to the leadership of thestate, the reign of Peace has never been broken. Perhaps I shouldn't sayit&quot; –he coughed gently? &quot;but I have been told that my people, myfellow-citizens rather, know me as Asper, the Well-Beloved.&quot;Mallow's eyes wandered over the well-kept garden. Perhaps the tall men andthe strangely-designed but openly-vicious weapons they carried justhappened to be lurking in odd comers as a precaution against himself. Thatwould be understandable. But the lofty, steel-girdered walls that circledthe place had quite obviously been recently strengthened-- an unfittingoccupation for such a Well-Beloved Asper.<br />
He said, &quot;It is fortunate that I have you to deal with then, Commdor. Thedespots and monarchs of surrounding worlds, which haven't the benefit ofenlightened administration, often lack the qualities that would make aruler well-beloved.&quot;<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; There was a cautious note in the Commdor's voice.<br />
&quot;Such as a concern for the best interests of their people, You, on theother hand, would understand,&quot;The Commdor kept his eyes on the gravel path as they walked leisurely, Hishands caressed each other behind his back.<br />
Mallow went on smoothly, &quot;Up to now, trade between our two nations hassuffered because of the restrictions placed upon our traders by yourgovernment. Surely, it has long been evident to you that unlimited trade?<br />
&quot;Free Trade!&quot; mumbled the Commdor.<br />
&quot;Free Trade, then. You must see that it would be of benefit to both of us.<br />
There are things you have that we want, and things we have that you want.<br />
It asks only an exchange to bring increased prosperity. An enlightenedruler such as yourself, a friend of the people--I might say, a member ofthe people-- needs no elaboration on that theme. I won't insult yourintelligence by offering any.&quot;<br />
&quot;True! I have seen this. But what would you?&quot; His voice was a plaintivewhine. &quot;Your people have always been so unreasonable. I am in favor of allthe trade our economy can support, but not on your terms. I am not solemaster here.&quot; His voice rose, &quot;I am only the servant of public opinion. Mypeople will not take commerce which carries with it a compulsory religion.&quot;Mallow drew himself up, &quot;A compulsory religion?&quot;<br />
&quot;So it has always been in effect. Surely you remember the case of Askonetwenty years ago. First they were sold some of your goods and then yourpeople asked for complete freedom of missionary effort in order that thegoods might be run properly; that Temples of Health be set up. There wasthen the establishment of religious schools; autonomous rights for allofficers of the religion and with what result? Askone is now an integralmember of the Foundation's system and the Grand Master cannot call hisunderwear his own. Oh, no! Oh, no! The dignity of an independent peoplecould never suffer it.&quot;<br />
&quot;None of what you speak is at all what I suggest,&quot; interposed Mallow.<br />
&quot;No?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I'm a Master Trader. Money is my religion. All this mysticism andhocus-pocus of the missionaries annoy me, and I'm glad you refuse tocountenance it. It makes you more my type of man.&quot;The Commdor's laugh was high-pitched and jerky, &quot;Well said! The Foundationshould have sent a man of your caliber before this.&quot;He laid a friendly hand upon the trader's bulking shoulder, &quot;But man, youhave told me only half. You have told me what the catch is not. Now tell mewhat it is.&quot;<br />
&quot;The only catch, Commdor, is that you're going to be burdened with animmense quantity of riches.&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot; he snuffled. &quot;But what could I want with riches? The true wealthis the love of one's people. I have that.&quot;<br />
&quot;You can have both, for it is possible to gather gold with one hand andlove with the other.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now that, my young man, would be an interesting phenomenon, if it werepossible. How would you go about it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, in a number of ways. The difficulty is choosing among them. Let's see.<br />
Well, luxury items, for instance. This object here, now?<br />
Mallow drew gently out of an inner pocket a flat, linked chain of polishedmetal. &quot;This, for instance.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's got to be demonstrated. Can you get a woman? Any young female willdo. And a mirror, full length.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hm-mmm. Let's get indoors, then.&quot;The Commdor referred to his dwelling place as a house. The populaceundoubtedly would call it a palace. To Mallow's straightforward eyes, itlooked uncommonly like a fortress. it was built on an eminence thatoverlooked the capital. Its walls were thick and reinforced. Its approacheswere guarded, and its architecture was shaped for defense. Just the type ofdwelling, Mallow thought sourly, for Asper, the Well-Beloved.<br />
A young girl was before them. She bent low to the Commdor, who said, &quot;Thisis one of the Commdora's girls. Will she do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Perfectly!&quot;The Commdor watched carefully while Mallow snapped the chain about thegirl's waist, and stepped back.<br />
The Commdor snuffled, &quot;Well. Is that all?&quot;<br />
&quot;Will you draw the curtain, Commdor. Young lady, there's a little knob justnear the snap. Will you move it upward, please? Go ahead, it won't hurtyou.&quot;The girl did so, drew a sharp breath, looked at her hands, and gasped,&quot;Oh!&quot;From her waist as a source she was drowned in a pale, streamingluminescence of shifting color that drew itself over her head in a flashingcoronet of liquid fire. It was as if someone had tom the aurora borealisout of the sky and molded it into a cloak.<br />
The girl stepped to the mirror and stared, fascinated.<br />
&quot;Here, take this.&quot; Mallow handed her a necklace of dull pebbles. &quot;Put itaround your neck.&quot;The girl did so, and each pebble, as it entered the luminescent fieldbecame an individual flame that leaped and sparkled in crimson and gold.<br />
&quot;What do you think of it?&quot; Mallow asked her. The girl didn't answer butthere was adoration in her eyes. The Commdor gestured and reluctantly, shepushed the knob down, and the glory died. She left-- with a memory.<br />
&quot;It's yours, Commdor,&quot; said Mallow, &quot;for the Commdora. Consider it a smallgift from the Foundation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hm-mmm.' The Commdor turned the belt and necklace over in his hand asthough calculating the weight. &quot;How is it done?&quot;Mallow shrugged, &quot;That's a question for our technical experts. But it willwork for you without-- mark you, without-- priestly help.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it's only feminine frippery after all. What could you do with it?<br />
Where would the money come in?&quot;<br />
&quot;You have balls, receptions, banquets-- that sort of thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you realize what women will pay for that sort of jewelry? Ten thousandcredits, at least.&quot;The Commdor seemed struck in a heap, &quot;Ah!&quot;<br />
&quot;And since the power unit of this particular item will not last longer thansix months, there will be the necessity of frequent replacements. Now wecan sell as many of these as you want for the equivalent in wrought iron ofone thousand credits. There's nine hundred percent profit for you.&quot;The Commdor plucked at his beard and seemed engaged in awesome mentalcalculations, &quot;Galaxy, how they would fight for them. I'll keep the supplysmall and let them bid. Of course, it wouldn't do to let them know that Ipersonally?<br />
Mallow said, &quot;We can explain the workings of dummy corporations, if youwould like. –Then, working further at random, take our complete line ofhousehold gadgets. We have collapsible stoves that will roast the toughestmeats to the desired tenderness in two minutes. We've got knives that won'trequire sharpening. We've got the equivalent of a complete laundry that canbe packed in a small closet and will work entirely automatically. Dittodish-washers. Ditto-ditto floor-scrubbers, furniture polishers,dust-precipitators, lighting fixtures--oh, anything you like. Think ofyour increased popularity, if you make them available to the public. Thinkof your increased quantity of, uh, worldly goods, if they're available as agovernment monopoly at nine hundred percent profit. It will be worth manytimes the money to them, and they needn't know what you pay for it. And,mind you, none of it will require priestly supervision. Everybody will behappy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Except you, it seems. What do you get out of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just what every trader gets by Foundation law. My men and I will collecthalf of whatever profits we take in. Just you buy all I want to sell you,and we'll both make out quite well. Quite well.&quot;The Commdor was enjoying his thoughts, &quot;What did you say you wanted to bepaid with? Iron?&quot;<br />
&quot;That, and coal, and bauxite. Also tobacco, pepper, magnesium, hardwood.<br />
Nothing you haven't got enough of.&quot;<br />
&quot;It sounds well.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think so. Oh, and still another item at random, Commdor. I could retoolyour factories.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh? How's that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, take your steel foundries. I have handy little gadgets that could dotricks with steel that would cut production costs to one percent ofprevious marks. You could cut prices by half, and still split extremely fatprofits with the manufacturers. I tell you, I could show you exactly what Imean, if you allowed me a demonstration. Do you have a steel foundry inthis city? It wouldn't take long.&quot;<br />
&quot;It could be arranged, Trader Mallow. But tomorrow, tomorrow. Would youdine with us tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;My men? began Mallow.<br />
&quot;Let them all come,&quot; said the Commdor, expansively. &quot;A symbolic friendlyunion of our nations. It will give us a chance for further friendlydiscussion. But one thing,&quot; his face lengthened and grew stem, &quot;none ofyour religion. Don't think that all this is an entering wedge for themissionaries.&quot;<br />
&quot;Commdor,&quot; said Mallow, dryly, &quot;I give you my word that religion would cutmy profits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then that will do for now. You'll be escorted back to your ship.&quot;<br />
6<br />
The Commdora was much younger than her husband. Her face was pale andcoldly formed and her black hair was drawn smoothly and tightly back.<br />
Her voice was tart. &quot;You are quite finished, my gracious and noble husband?<br />
Quite, quite finished? I suppose I may even enter the garden if I wish,now.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is no need for dramatics, Licia, my dear,&quot; said the Commdor, mildly.<br />
&quot;The young man will attend at dinner tonight, and you can speak with himall you wish and even amuse yourself by listening to all I say. Room willhave to be arranged for his men somewhere about the place. The stars grantthat they be few in numbers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Most likely they'll be great hogs of eaters who will eat meat by thequarter-animal and wine by the hogshead. And you will groan for two nightswhen you calculate the expense.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well now, perhaps I won't. Despite your opinion, the dinner is to be onthe most lavish scale.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; She stared at him contemptuously. &quot;You are very friendly withthese barbarians. Perhaps that is why I was not to be permitted to attendyour conversation. Perhaps your little weazened soul is plotting to turnagainst my father.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I'd be likely to believe you, wouldn't I? If ever a poor woman wassacrificed for policy to an unsavory marriage, it was myself. I could havepicked a more proper man from the alleys and mudheaps of my native world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, now, I'll tell you what, my lady. Perhaps you would enjoy returningto your native world. Except that, to retain as a souvenir that portion ofyou with which I am best acquainted, I could have your tongue cut outfirst. And,&quot; he tolled his head, calculatingly, to one side, &quot;as a finalimproving touch to your beauty, your ears and the tip of your nose aswell.&quot;<br />
&quot;You wouldn't dare, you little pug-dog. My father would pulverize your toynation to meteoric dust. In fact, he might do it in any case, if I told himyou were treating with these barbarians.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hm-mmm. Well, there's no need for threats. You are free to question theman yourself tonight. Meanwhile, madam, keep your wagging tongue still.&quot;<br />
&quot;At your orders?&quot;<br />
&quot;Here, take this, then, and keep still.&quot;The band was about her waist and the necklace around her neck. He pushedthe knob himself and stepped back.<br />
The Commdora drew in her breath and held out her hands stiffly. Shefingered the necklace gingerly, and gasped again.<br />
The Commdor rubbed his hands with satisfaction and said, &quot;You may wear ittonight--and I'll get you more. Now keep still.&quot;The Commdora kept still.<br />
7<br />
Jaim Twer fidgeted and shuffled his feet. He said, &quot;What's twisting yourface?&quot;Hober Mallow lifted out of his brooding, &quot;Is my face twisted? It's notmeant so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Something must have happened yesterday, –I mean, besides that feast.&quot; Withsudden conviction, &quot;Mallow, there's trouble, isn't there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Trouble? No. Quite the opposite. In fact, I'm in the position of throwingmy full weight against a door and finding it ajar at the time. We'regetting into this steel foundry too easily.&quot;<br />
&quot;You suspect a trap?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, for Seldon's sake, don't be melodramatic.&quot; Mallow swallowed hisimpatience and added conversationally, &quot;It's just that the easy entrancemeans there will be nothing to see.<br />
&quot;Nuclear power, huh?&quot; Twer ruminated. &quot;I'll tell you. There's just about noevidence of any nuclear power economy here in Korell. And it would bepretty hard to mask all signs of the widespread effects a fundamentaltechnology such as nucleics would have on everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not if it was just starting up, Twer, and being applied to a war economy.<br />
You'd find it in the shipyards and the steel foundries only.&quot;<br />
&quot;So if we don't find it, then?<br />
&quot;Then they haven't got it--or they're not showing it. Toss a coin or takea guess.&quot;Twer shook his head, &quot;I wish I'd been with you yesterday.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish you had, too,&quot; said Mallow stonily. &quot;I have no objection to moralsupport. Unfortunately, it was the Commdor who set the terms of themeeting, and not myself. And what is coming now would seem to be the royalgroundcar to escort us to the foundry. Have you got the gadgets?&quot;<br />
&quot;All of them.&quot;<br />
8<br />
The foundry was large, and bore the odor of decay which no amount ofsuperficial repairs could quite erase. It was empty now and in quite anunnatural state of quiet, as it played unaccustomed host to the Commdor andhis court.<br />
Mallow had swung the steel sheet onto the two supports with a carelessheave. He had taken the instrument held out to him by Twer and was grippingthe leather handle inside its leaden sheath.<br />
&quot;The instrument,&quot; he said, &quot;is dangerous, but so is a buzz saw. You justhave to keep your fingers away.&quot;And as he spoke, he drew the muzzle-slit swiftly down the length of thesteel sheet, which quietly and instantly fell in two.<br />
There was a unanimous jump, and Mallow laughed. He picked up one of thehalves and propped it against his knee, &quot;You can adjust the cutting-lengthaccurately to a hundredth of an inch, and a two-inch sheet will slit downthe middle as easily as this thing did. If you've got the thickness exactlyjudged, you can place steel on a wooden table, and split the metal withoutscratching the wood.&quot;And at each phrase, the nuclear shear moved and a gouged chunk of steelflew across the room.<br />
&quot;That,&quot; he said, &quot;is whittling--with steel.&quot;He passed back the shear. &quot;Or else you have the plane. Do you want todecrease the thickness of a sheet, smooth out an irregularity, removecorrosion? Watch!&quot;Thin, transparent foil flew off the other half of the original sheet insix-inch swarths, then eight-inch, then twelve.<br />
&quot;Or drills? It's all the same principle.&quot;They were crowded around now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand show, acomer magician, a vaudeville act made into high-pressure salesmanship.<br />
Commdor Asper fingered scraps of steel. High officials of the governmenttiptoed over each other's shoulders, and whispered, while Mallow punchedclean, beautiful round holes through an inch of hard steel at every touchof his nuclear drill.<br />
&quot;Just one more demonstration. Bring two short lengths of pipe, somebody.&quot;An Honorable Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang to obedience in thegeneral excitement and thought-absorption, and stained his hands like anylaborer.<br />
Mallow stood them upright and shaved the ends off with a single stroke ofthe shear, and then joined the pipes, fresh cut to fresh cut.<br />
And there was a single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic irregularitiesmissing, formed one piece upon joining.<br />
Then Mallow looked up at his audience, stumbled at his first word andstopped. There was the keen stirring of excitement in his chest, and thebase of his stomach went tingly and cold.<br />
The Commdor's own bodyguard, in the confusion, had struggled to the frontline, and Mallow, for the first time, was near enough to see theirunfamiliar hand-weapons in detail.<br />
They were nuclear! There was no mistaking it; an explosive projectileweapon with a barrel like that was impossible. But that wasn't the bigpoint. That wasn't the point at all.<br />
The butts of those weapons had, deeply etched upon them, in worn goldplating, the Spaceship-and-Sun!<br />
The same Spaceship-and-Sun that was stamped on every. one of the greatvolumes of the original Encyclopedia that the Foundation had begun and notyet finished. The same Spaceship-and-Sun that had blazoned the banner ofthe Galactic Empire through millennia.<br />
Mallow talked through and around his thoughts, &quot;Test that pipe! It's onepiece. Not perfect; naturally, the joining shouldn't be done by hand.&quot;There was no need of further legerdemain. It had gone over. Mallow wasthrough. He had what he wanted. There was only one thing in his mind. Thegolden globe with its conventionalized rays, and the oblique cigar shapethat was a space vessel.<br />
The Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire!<br />
The Empire! The words drilled! A century and a half had passed but therewas still the-Empire, somewhere deeper in the Galaxy. And it was emergingagain, out into the Periphery.<br />
Mallow smiled!<br />
9<br />
The Far Star was two days out in space, when Hober Mallow, in his privatequarters with Senior Lieutenant Drawt, handed him an envelope, a roll ofmicrofilm, and a silvery spheroid.<br />
&quot;As of an hour from now, Lieutenant, you're Acting Captain of the Far Star,until I return, –or forever.&quot;Drawt made a motion of standing but Mallow waved him down imperiously.<br />
&quot;Quiet, and listen. The envelope contains the exact location of the planetto which you're to proceed. There you will wait for me for two months. If,before the two months are up, the Foundation locates you, the microfilm ismy report of the trip.<br />
&quot;If, however,&quot; and his voice was somber, &quot;I do not return at the end of twomonths, and Foundation vessels do not locate you, proceed to the planet,Terminus, and hand in the Time Capsule as the report. Do you understandthat?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
&quot;At no time are you, or any of the men, to amplify in any single instance,my official report.&quot;<br />
&quot;If we are questioned, sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you know nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;The interview ended, and fifty minutes later, a lifeboat kicked lightly offthe side of the Far Star.<br />
10<br />
Onum Barr was an old man, too old to be afraid. Since the lastdisturbances, he had lived alone on the fringes of the land with what bookshe had saved from the ruins. He had nothing he feared losing, least of allthe worn remnant of his life, and so he faced the intruder withoutcringing.<br />
&quot;Your door was open,&quot; the stranger explained.<br />
His accent was clipped and harsh, and Barr did not fail to notice thestrange blue-steel hand-weapon at his hip. In the half gloom of the smallroom, Barr saw the glow of a force-shield surrounding the man.<br />
He said, wearily, &quot;There is no reason to keep it closed. Do you wishanything of me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The stranger remained standing in the center of the room. He waslarge, both in height and bulk. &quot;Yours is the only house about here.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is a desolate place,&quot; agreed Barr, &quot;but there is a town to the east. Ican show you the way'.&quot;<br />
&quot;In a while. May I sit?&quot;<br />
&quot;If the chairs will hold you,&quot; said the old man, gravely. They were old,too. Relics of a better youth.<br />
The stranger said, &quot;My name is Hober Mallow. I come from a far province.&quot;Barr nodded and smiled, &quot;Your tongue convicted you of that long ago. I amOnum Barr of Siwenna-- and once Patrician of the Empire.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then this is Siwenna. I had only old maps to guide me.&quot;<br />
&quot;They would have to be old, indeed, for star-positions to be misplaced.&quot;Barr sat quite still, while the other's eyes drifted away into a reverie.<br />
He noticed that the nuclear force-shield had vanished from about the manand admitted dryly to himself that his person no longer seemed formidableto strangers-- or even, for good or for evil, to his enemies.<br />
He said, &quot;My house is poor and my resources few. You may share what I haveif your stomach can endure black bread and dried corn.&quot;Mallow shook his head, &quot;No, I have eaten, and I can't stay. All I need arethe directions to the center of government.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is easily enough done, and poor though I am, deprives me of nothing.<br />
Do you mean the capital of the planet, or of the Imperial Sector?&quot;The younger man's eyes narrowed, &quot;Aren't the two identical? Isn't thisSiwenna?&quot;The old patrician nodded slowly, &quot;Siwenna, yes. But Siwenna is no longercapital of the Normannic Sector. Your old map has misled you after all. Thestars may not change even in centuries, but political boundaries are alltoo fluid.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's too bad. In fact, that's very bad. Is the new capital far off?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's on Orsha II. Twenty parsecs off. Your map will direct you. How old isit?&quot;<br />
&quot;A hundred and fifty years.&quot;<br />
&quot;That old?&quot; The old man sighed. &quot;History has been crowded since. Do youknow any of it?&quot;Mallow shook his bead slowly.<br />
Barr said, &quot;You're fortunate. It has been an evil time for the provinces,but for the reign of Stannell VI, and he died fifty years ago. Since thattime, rebellion and ruin, ruin and rebellion.&quot; Barr wondered if he weregrowing garrulous. It was a lonely life out here, and he had so littlechance to talk to men.<br />
Mallow said with sudden sharpness, &quot;Ruin, eh? You sound as if the provincewere impoverished.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps not on an absolute scale. The physical resources of twenty-fivefirst-rank planets take a long time to use up. Compared to the wealth ofthe last century, though, we have gone a long way downhill--and there isno sign of turning, not yet. Why are you so interested in all this, youngman? You are all alive and your eyes shine!&quot;The trader came near enough to blushing, as the faded eyes seemed to looktoo deep into his and smile at what they saw.<br />
He said, &quot;Now look here. I'm a trader out there--out toward the rim of theGalaxy. I've located some old maps, and I'm out to open new markets.<br />
Naturally, talk of impoverished provinces disturbs me. You can't get moneyout of a world unless money's there to be got. Now how's Siwenna, forinstance?&quot;The old man leaned forward, &quot;I cannot say. It will do even yet, perhaps.<br />
But you a trader? You look more like a fighting man. You hold your handnear your gun and there is a scar on your jawbone.&quot;Mallow jerked his head, &quot;There isn't much law out there where I come from.<br />
Fighting and scars are part of a trader's overhead. But fighting is onlyuseful when there's money at the end, and if I can get it without, so muchthe sweeter. Now will I find enough money here to make it worth thefighting? I take it I can find the fighting easily enough.&quot;<br />
&quot;Easily enough,&quot; agreed Barr. &quot;You could join Wiscard's remnants in the RedStars. I don't know, though, if you'd call that fighting or piracy. Or youcould join our present gracious viceroy-- gracious by right of murder,pillage, rapine, and the word of a boy Emperor, since rightfullyassassinated.&quot; The patrician's thin cheeks reddened. His eyes closed andthen opened, bird-bright.<br />
&quot;You don't sound very friendly to the viceroy, Patrician Barr,&quot; saidMallow. &quot;What if I'm one of his spies?&quot;<br />
&quot;What if you are?&quot; said Barr, bitterly. &quot;What can you take?&quot; He gestured awithered arm at the bare interior of the decaying mansion.<br />
&quot;Your life.&quot;<br />
&quot;It would leave me easily enough. It has been with me five years too long.<br />
But you are not one of the viceroy's men. If you were, perhaps even nowinstinctive self-preservation would keep my mouth closed.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;The old man laughed, &quot;You seem suspicious--Come, I'll wager you think I'mtrying to trap you into denouncing the government. No, no. I am pastpolitics.&quot;<br />
&quot;Past politics? Is a man ever past that? The words you used to describe theviceroy--what were they? Murder, pillage, all that. You didn't soundobjective. Not exactly. Not as if you were past politics.&quot;The old man shrugged, &quot;Memories sting when they come suddenly. Listen!<br />
Judge for yourself! When Siwenna was the provincial capital, I was apatrician and a member of the provincial senate. My family was an old andhonored one. One of my great-grandfathers had been?No, never mind that.<br />
Past glories are poor feeding.&quot;<br />
&quot;I take it,&quot; said Mallow, &quot;there was a civil war, or a revolution.&quot;Barr's face darkened. &quot;Civil wars are chronic in these degenerate days, butSiwenna had kept apart. Under Stannell VI, it had almost achieved itsancient prosperity. But weak emperors followed, and weak emperors meanstrong viceroys, and our last viceroy--the same Wiscard, whose remnantsstill prey on the commerce among the Red Stars--aimed at the ImperialPurple. He wasn't the first to aim. And if he had succeeded, he wouldn'thave been the first to succeed.<br />
&quot;But he failed. For when the Emperor's Admiral approached the province atthe head of a fleet, Siwenna itself rebelled against its rebel viceroy.&quot; Hestopped, sadly.<br />
Mallow found himself tense on the edge of his seat, and relaxed slowly,&quot;Please continue, sir.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Barr, wearily. &quot;It's kind of you to humor an old man.<br />
They rebelled; or I should say, we rebelled, for I was one of the minorleaders. Wiscard left Siwenna, barely ahead of us, and the planet, and withit the province, were thrown open to the admiral with every gesture ofloyalty to the Emperor. Why we did this, –I'm not sure. Maybe we felt loyalto the symbol, if not the person, of the Emperor, –a cruel and viciouschild. Maybe we feared the horrors of a siege.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; urged Mallow, gently.<br />
&quot;Well, came the grim retort, &quot;that didn't suit the admiral. He wanted theglory of conquering a rebellious province and his men wanted the loot suchconquest would involve. So while the people were still gathered in everylarge city, cheering the Emperor and his admiral, he occupied all armedcenters, and then ordered the population put to the nuclear blast.&quot;<br />
&quot;On what pretext?&quot;<br />
&quot;On the pretext that they had rebelled against their viceroy, the Emperor'sanointed. And the admiral became the new viceroy, by virtue of one month ofmassacre, pillage and complete horror. I had six sons. Five died--<br />
variously. I had a daughter. I hope she died, eventually. I escaped becauseI was old. I came here, too old to cause even our viceroy worry.&quot; He benthis gray head, &quot;They left me nothing, because I had helped drive out arebellious governor and deprived an admiral of his glory.&quot;Mallow sat silent, and waited. Then, &quot;What of your sixth son?&quot; he askedsoftly.<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Barr smiled acidly. &quot;He is safe, for he has joined the admiral as acommon soldier under an assumed name. He is a gunner in the viceroy'spersonal fleet. Oh, no, I see your eyes. He is not an unnatural son. Hevisits me when he can and gives me what he can. He keeps me alive. And someday, our great and glorious viceroy will grovel to his death, and it willbe my son who will be his executioner.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you tell this to a stranger? You endanger your son.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I help him, by introducing a new enemy. And were I a friend of theviceroy, as I am his enemy, I would tell him to string outer space withships, clear to the rim of the Galaxy.&quot;<br />
&quot;There are no ships there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you find any? Did any space-guards question your entry? With ships fewenough, and the bordering provinces filled with their share of intrigue andiniquity, none can be spared to guard the barbarian outer suns. No dangerever threatened us from the broken edge of the Galaxy, –until you came.&quot;<br />
&quot;I? I'm no danger.&quot;<br />
&quot;There will be more after you.&quot;Mallow shook his head slowly, &quot;I'm not sure I understand you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Listen!&quot; There was a feverish edge to the old man's voice. &quot;I knew youwhen you entered. You have a force-shield about your body, or had when Ifirst saw you.&quot;Doubtful silence, then, &quot;Yes, –I had.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. That was a flaw, but you didn't know that. There are some things Iknow. It's out of fashion in these decaying times to be a scholar. Eventsrace and flash past and who cannot fight the tide with nuclear-blast inhand is swept away, as I was. But I was a scholar, and I know that in allthe history of nucleics, no portable force-shield was ever invented. Wehave force-shields--huge, lumbering powerhouses that will protect a city,or even a ship, but not one, single man.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah?&quot; Mallow's underlip thrust out. &quot;And what do you deduce from that?&quot;<br />
&quot;There have been stories percolating through space. They travel strangepaths and become distorted with every parsec, –but when I was young therewas a small ship of strange men, who did not know our customs and could nottell where they came from. They talked of magicians at the edge of theGalaxy; magicians who glowed in the darkness, who flew unaided through theair, and whom weapons would not touch.<br />
&quot;We laughed. I laughed, too. I forgot it till today. But you glow in thedarkness, and I don't think my blaster, if I had one, would hurt you. Tellme, can you fly through air as you sit there now?&quot;Mallow said calmly, &quot;I can make nothing of all this.&quot;Barr smiled, &quot;I'm content with the answer. I do not examine my guests. Butif there are magicians; if you are one of them; there may some day be agreat influx of them, or you. Perhaps that would be well. Maybe we need newblood.&quot; He muttered soundlessly to himself, then, slowly, &quot;But it works theother way, too. Our new viceroy also dreams, as did our old Wiscard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Also after the Emperor's crown?&quot;Barr nodded, &quot;My son hears tales. In the viceroy's personal entourage, onecould scarcely help it. And he tells me of them. Our new viceroy would notrefuse the Crown if offered, but he guards his line of retreat. There arestories that, failing Imperial heights, he plans to carve out a new Empirein the Barbarian hinterland. It is said, but I don't vouch for this, thathe has already given one of his daughters as wife to a Kinglet somewhere inthe uncharted Periphery.&quot;<br />
&quot;If one listened to every story?<br />
&quot;I know. There are many more. I'm old and I babble nonsense. But what doyou say?&quot; And those sharp, old eyes peered deep.<br />
The trader considered, &quot;I say nothing. But I'd like to ask something. DoesSiwenna have nuclear power? Now, wait, I know that it possesses theknowledge of nucleics. I mean, do they have power generators intact, or didthe recent sack destroy them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Destroy them? Oh, no. Half a planet would be wiped out before the smallestpower station would be touched. They are irreplaceable and the suppliers ofthe strength of the fleet.&quot; Almost proudly, &quot;We have the largest and beston this side of Trantor itself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what would I do first if I wanted to see these generators?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing!&quot; replied Barr, decisively. &quot;You couldn't approach any militarycenter without being shot down instantly. Neither could anyone. Siwenna isstill deprived of civic rights.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean all the power stations are under the military?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. There are the small city stations, the ones supplying power forheating and lighting homes, powering vehicles and so forth. Those arealmost as bad. They're controlled by the tech-men.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who are they?&quot;<br />
&quot;A specialized group which supervises the power plants. The honor ishereditary, the young ones being brought up in the profession asapprentices. Strict sense of duty, honor, and all that. No one but atech-man could enter a station.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't say, though,&quot; added Barr, &quot;that there aren't cases where tech-menhaven't been bribed. In days when we have nine emperors in fifty years andseven of these are assassinated, –when every space-captain aspires to theusurpation of a viceroyship, and every viceroy to the Imperium,I suppose even a tech-man can fall prey to money. But it would require agood deal, and I have none. Have you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Money? No. But does one always bribe with money?&quot;<br />
&quot;What else, when money buys all else.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is quite enough that money won't buy. And now if you'll tell me thenearest city with one of the stations, and how best to get there, I'llthank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Barr held out his thin hands. &quot;Where do you rush? You come here,but I ask no questions. In the city, where the inhabitants are still calledrebels, you would be challenged by the first soldier or guard who heardyour accent and saw your clothes.&quot;He rose and from an obscure comer of an old chest brought out a booklet.<br />
&quot;My passport, –forged. I escaped with it.&quot;He placed it in Mallow's hand and folded the fingers over it. &quot;Thedescription doesn't fit, but if you flourish it, the chances are many toone they will not look closely.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you. You'll be left without one.&quot;The old exile shrugged cynically, &quot;What of it? And a further caution. Curbyour tongue! Your accent is barbarous, your idioms peculiar, and every oncein a while you deliver yourself of the most astounding archaisms. The lessyou speak, the less suspicion you will draw upon yourself. Now I'll tellyou how to get to the city?<br />
Five minutes later, Mallow was gone.<br />
He returned but once, for a moment, to the old patrician's house, beforeleaving it entirely, however. And when Onum Barr stepped into his littlegarden early the next morning, he found a box at his feet. It containedprovisions, concentrated provisions such as one would find aboard ship, andalien in taste and preparation.<br />
But they were good, and lasted long.<br />
11<br />
The tech-man was short, and his skin glistened with well-kept plumpness.<br />
His hair was a fringe and his skull shone through pinkly. The rings on hisfingers were thick and heavy, his clothes were scented, and he was thefirst man Mallow had met on the planet who hadn't looked hungry.<br />
The tech-man's lips pursed peevishly, &quot;Now, my man, quickly. I have thingsof great importance waiting for me. You seem a stranger? He seemed toevaluate Mallow's definitely un-Siwennese costume and his eyelids wereheavy with suspicion.<br />
&quot;I am not of the neighborhood,&quot; said Mallow, calmly, &quot;but the matter isirrelevant. I have had the honor to send you a little gift yesterday?<br />
The tech-man's nose lifted, &quot;I received it. An interesting gewgaw. I mayhave use for it on occasion.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have other and more interesting gifts. Quite out of the gewgaw stage.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh-h?&quot; The tech-man's voice lingered thoughtfully over the monosyllable.<br />
&quot;I think I already see the course of the interview; it has happened before.<br />
You are going to give me some trifle or other. A few credits, perhaps acloak, second-rate jewelry; anything your little soul may think sufficientto corrupt a tech-man.&quot; His lower lip puffed out belligerently, &quot;And I knowwhat you wish in exchange. There have been others and to spare with thesame bright idea. You wish to be adopted into our clan. You wish to betaught the mysteries of nucleics and the care of the machines. You thinkbecause you dogs of Siwenna--and probably your strangerhood is assumed forsafety's sake--are being daily punished for your rebellion that you canescape what you deserve by throwing over yourselves the privileges andprotections of the tech-man's guild.&quot;Mallow would have spoken, but the tech-man raised himself into a suddenroar. &quot;And now leave before I report your name to the Protector of theCity. Do you think that I would betray the trust? The Siwennese traitorsthat preceded me would have--perhaps! But you deal with a different breednow. Why, Galaxy, I marvel that I do not kill you myself at this momentwith my bare hands.&quot;Mallow smiled to himself. The entire speech was patently artificial in toneand content, so that all the dignified indignation degenerated intouninspired farce.<br />
The trader glanced humorously at the two flabby hands that had been namedas his possible executioners then and there, and said, &quot;Your Wisdom, youare wrong on three counts. First, I am not a creature of the viceroy cometo test your loyalty. Second, my gift is something the Emperor himself inall his splendor does not and will never possess. Third, what I wish inreturn is very little; a nothing; a mere breath.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you say!&quot; He descended into heavy sarcasm. &quot;Come, what is this imperialdonation that your godlike power wishes to bestow upon me? Something theEmperor doesn't have, eh?&quot; He broke into a sharp squawk of derision.<br />
Mallow rose and pushed the chair aside, &quot;I have waited three days to seeyou, Your Wisdom, but the display will take only three seconds. If you willjust draw that blaster whose butt I see very near your hand?<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;And shoot me, I will be obliged.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;If I am killed, you can tell the police I tried to bribe you intobetraying guild secrets. You'll receive high praise. If I am not killed,you may have my shield.&quot;For the first time, the tech-man became aware of the dimly-whiteillumination that hovered closely about his visitor, as though he had beendipped in pearl-dust. His blaster raised to the level and with eyesa-squint in wonder and suspicion, he closed contact.<br />
The molecules of air caught in the sudden surge of atomic disruption, toreinto glowing, burning ions, and marked out the blinding thin line thatstruck at Mallow's heart--and splashed!<br />
While Mallow's look of patience never changed, the nuclear forces that toreat him consumed themselves against that fragile, pearly illumination, andcrashed back to die in mid-air.<br />
The tech-man's blaster dropped to the floor with an unnoticed crash.<br />
Mallow said, &quot;Does the Emperor have a personal force-shield? You can haveone.&quot;The tech-man stuttered, &quot;Are you a tech-man?&quot;<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then--then where did you get that?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you care?&quot; Mallow was coolly contemptuous. &quot;Do you want it?&quot; Athin, knobbed chain fell upon the desk, &quot;There it is.&quot;The tech-man snatched it up and fingered it nervously, &quot;Is this complete?&quot;<br />
&quot;Complete.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where's the power?&quot;Mallow's finger fell upon the largest knob, dull in its leaden case.<br />
The tech-man looked up, and his face was congested with blood, &quot;Sir, I am atech-man, senior grade. I have twenty years behind me as supervisor and Istudied under the great Bier at the University of Trantor. If you have theinfernal charlatanry to tell me that a small container the size of a--of awalnut, blast it, holds a nuclear generator, I'll have you before theProtector in three seconds.&quot;<br />
&quot;Explain it yourself then, if you can. I say it's complete.&quot;The tech-man's flush faded slowly as he bound the chain about his waist,and, following Mallow's gesture, pushed the knob. The radiance thatsurrounded him shone into dim relief. His blaster lifted, then hesitated.<br />
Slowly, he adjusted it to an almost burnless minimum.<br />
And then, convulsively, he closed circuit and the nuclear fire dashedagainst his hand, harmlessly.<br />
.He whirled, &quot;And what if I shoot you now, and keep the shield.&quot;<br />
&quot;Try!&quot; said Mallow. &quot;Do you think I gave you my only sample?&quot; And he, too,was solidly incased in light.<br />
The tech-man giggled nervously. The blaster clattered onto the desk. Hesaid, &quot;And what is this mere nothing, this breath, that you wish inreturn'?&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to see your generators.&quot;<br />
&quot;You realize that that is forbidden. It would mean ejection into space forboth of us?<br />
&quot;I don't want to touch them or have anything to do with them. I want to seethem--from a distance.&quot;<br />
&quot;If not?&quot;<br />
&quot;If not, you have your shield, but I have other things. For one thing, ablaster especially designed to pierce that shield.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hm-mmm.&quot; The tech-man's eyes shifted. &quot;Come with me.&quot;<br />
12<br />
The tech-man's home was a small two-story affair on the Outskirts of thehuge, cubiform, windowless affair that dominated the center of the city.<br />
Mallow passed from one to the other through an underground passage, andfound himself in the silent, ozone-tinged atmosphere of the powerhouse.<br />
For fifteen minutes, he followed his guide and said nothing. His eyesmissed nothing. His fingers touched nothing. And then, the tech-man said instrangled tones, &quot;Have you had enough? I couldn't trust my underlings inthis case.&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you ever?&quot; asked Mallow, ironically. &quot;I've had enough.&quot;They were back in the office and Mallow said, thoughtfully, &quot;And all thosegenerators are in your hands?&quot;<br />
&quot;Every one,&quot; said the tech-man, with more than a touch of complacency.<br />
&quot;And you keep them running and in order?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right!&quot;<br />
&quot;And if they break down?&quot;The tech-man shook his head indignantly, &quot;They don't break down. They neverbreak down. They were built for eternity.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eternity is a long time. Just suppose?<br />
&quot;It is unscientific to suppose meaningless cases.&quot;<br />
&quot;All right. Suppose I were to blast a vital part into nothingness? Isuppose the machines aren't immune to nuclear forces? Suppose I fuse avital connection, or smash a quartz D-tube?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then,&quot; shouted the tech-man, furiously, &quot;you would be killed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I know that,&quot; Mallow was shouting, too, &quot;but what about thegenerator? Could you repair it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; the tech-man howled his words, &quot;you have had a fair return. You'vehad what you asked for. Now get out! I owe you nothing more!&quot;Mallow bowed with a satiric respect and left.<br />
Two days later he was back where the Far Star waited to return with him tothe planet, Terminus.<br />
And two days later, the tech-man's shield went dead, and for all hispuzzling and cursing never glowed again.<br />
13<br />
Mallow relaxed for almost the first time in six months. He was on his backin the sunroom of his new house, stripped to the skin. His great, brownarms were thrown up and out, and the muscles tautened into a stretch, thenfaded into repose.<br />
The man beside him placed a cigar between Mallow's teeth and lit it. Hechamped on one of his own and said, &quot;You must be overworked. Maybe you needa long rest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I do, Jael, but I'd rather rest in a council seat. Because I'm goingto have that seat, and you're going to help me.&quot;Ankor Jael raised his eyebrows and said, &quot;How did I get into this?&quot;<br />
&quot;You got in obviously. Firstly, you're an old dog of a politico. Secondly,you were booted out of your cabinet seat by Jorane Sutt, the same fellowwho'd rather lose an eyeball than see me in the council. You don't thinkmuch of my chances, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not much,&quot; agreed the ex-Minister of Education. &quot;You're a Smyrnian.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's no legal bar. I've had a lay education.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, come now. Since when does prejudice follow any law but its own. Now,how about your own man-- this Jaim Twer? What does he say?&quot;<br />
&quot;He spoke about running me for council almost a year ago,&quot; replied Malloweasily, &quot;but I've outgrown him. He couldn't have pulled it off in any case.<br />
Not enough depth. He's loud and forceful--but that's only an expression ofnuisance value. I'm off to put over a real coup. I need you. &quot;<br />
&quot;Jorane Sutt is the cleverest politician on the planet and he'll be againstyou. I don't claim to be able to outsmart him. And don't think he doesn'tfight hard, and dirty.&quot;<br />
&quot;I've got money.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mat helps. But it takes a lot to buy off prejudice, you dirty Smyrnian.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll have a lot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I'll look into the matter. But don't ever you crawl up on your hindlegs and bleat that I encouraged you in the matter. Who's that?&quot;Mallow pulled the corners of his mouth down, and said, &quot;Jorane Sutthimself, I think. He's early, and I can understand it. I’ve been dodginghim for a month. Look, Jael, get into the next room, and turn the speakeron low. I want you to listen.&quot;He helped the council member out of the room with a shove of his bare foot,then scrambled up and into a silk robe. The synthetic sunlight faded tonormal power.<br />
The secretary to the mayor entered stiffly, while the solemn major-domotiptoed the door shut behind him.<br />
Mallow fastened his belt and said, &quot;Take your choice of chairs, Sutt.&quot;Sutt barely cracked a flickering smile. The chair he chose was comfortablebut he did not relax into it. From its edge, he said, &quot;If you'll state yourterms to begin with, we'll get down to business.&quot;<br />
&quot;What terms?&quot;<br />
&quot;You wish to be coaxed? Well, then, what, for instance, did you do atKorell? Your report was incomplete.&quot;<br />
&quot;I gave it to you months ago. You were satisfied then.&quot;Yes,&quot; Sutt rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with one finger, &quot;but sincethen your activities have been significant. We know a good deal of whatyou're doing, Mallow. We know, exactly, how many factories you're puttingup; in what a hurry you're doing it; and how much it's costing you. Andthere's this palace you have,&quot; he gazed about him with a cold lack ofappreciation, &quot;which set you back considerably more than my annual salary;and a swathe you've been cutting--a very considerable and expensive swathe?through the upper layers of Foundation society.&quot;<br />
&quot;So? Beyond proving that you employ capable spies, what does it show?&quot;<br />
&quot;It shows you have money you didn't have a year ago. And that can showanything-- for instance, that a good deal went on at Korell that we knownothing of. Where are you getting your money?&quot;<br />
&quot;My dear Sutt, you can't really expect me to tell you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn't think you did. That's why I'm going to tell you. It's straightfrom the treasure-chests of the Commdor of Korell.&quot;Sutt blinked.<br />
Mallow smiled and continued. &quot;Unfortunately for you, the money is quitelegitimate. I'm a Master Trader and the money I received was a quantity ofwrought iron and chromite in exchange for a number of trinkets I was ableto supply him with. Fifty per cent of the profit is mine by hideboundcontract with the Foundation. The other half goes to the government at theend of the year when all good citizens pay their income tax.&quot;<br />
&quot;There was no mention of any trade agreement in your report.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nor was there any mention of what I had for breakfast that day, or thename of my current mistress, or any other irrelevant detail.&quot; Mallow'ssmile was fading into a sneer. &quot;I was sent--to quote yourself--to keep myeyes open. They were never. shut. You wanted to find out what happened tothe captured Foundation merchant ships. I never saw or heard of them. Youwanted to find out if Korell had nuclear power. My report tells of nuclearblasters in the possession of the Commdor's private bodyguard. I saw noother signs. And the blasters I did see are relics of the old Empire, andmay be show-pieces that do not work, for all my knowledge.<br />
&quot;So far, I followed orders, but beyond that I was, and. still am, a freeagent. According to the laws of the Foundation, a Master Trader may openwhatever new markets he can, and receive therefrom his due half of theprofits. What are your objections? I don't see them.&quot;Sutt bent his eyes carefully towards the wall and spoke with a difficultlack of anger, &quot;It is the general custom of all traders to advance thereligion with their trade.&quot;<br />
&quot;I adhere to law, and not to custom.&quot;<br />
&quot;There are times when custom can be the higher law.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then appeal to the courts.&quot;Sutt raised somber eyes which seemed to retreat into their sockets. &quot;You'rea Smyrnian after all. It seems naturalization and education can't wipe outthe taint in the blood. Listen, and try to understand, just the same.<br />
&quot;This goes beyond money, or markets. We have the science of the great HariSeldon to prove that upon us depends the future empire of the Galaxy, andfrom the course that leads to that Imperium we cannot turn. The religion wehave is our all-important instrument towards that end. With it we havebrought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when theywould have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which tocontrol men and worlds.<br />
&quot;The primary reason for the development of trade and traders was tointroduce and spread this religion more quickly, and to insure that theintroduction of new techniques and a new economy would be subject to ourthorough and intimate control.&quot;He paused for breath, and Mallow interjected quietly, &quot;I know the theory. Iunderstand it entirely.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you? It is more than I expected. Then you see, of course, that yourattempt at trade for its own sake; at mass production of worthless gadgets,which can only affect a world's economy superficially; at the subversion ofinterstellar policy to the god of profits; at the divorce of nuclear powerfrom our controlling religion-- can only end with the overthrow andcomplete negation of the policy that has worked successfully for acentury.&quot;<br />
&quot;And time enough, too,&quot; said Mallow, indifferently, &quot;for a policy outdated,dangerous and impossible. However well your religion has succeeded in theFour Kingdoms, scarcely another world in the Periphery has accepted it. Atthe time we seized control of the Kingdoms, there were a sufficient numberof exiles, Galaxy knows, to spread the story of how Salvor Hardin used thepriesthood and the superstition of the people to overthrow the independenceand power of the secular monarchs. And if that wasn't enough, the case ofAskone two decades back made it plain enough. There isn't a ruler in thePeriphery now that wouldn't sooner cut his own throat than let a priest ofthe Foundation enter the territory.<br />
&quot;I don't propose to force Korell or any other world to accept something Iknow they don't want. No, Sutt. If nuclear power makes them dangerous, asincere friendship through trade will be many times better than an insecureoverlordship, based on the hated supremacy of a foreign spiritual power,which, once it weakens ever so slightly, can only fall entirely and leavenothing substantial behind except an immortal fear and hate.&quot;Suit said cynically, &quot;Very nicely put. So, to get back to the originalpoint of discussion, what are your terms? What do you require to exchangeyour ideas for mine?&quot;<br />
&quot;You think my convictions are for sale?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; came the cold response. &quot;Isn't that your business, buying andselling?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only at a profit,&quot; said Mallow, unoffended. &quot;Can you offer me more thanI'm getting as is?&quot;<br />
&quot;You could have three-quarters of your trade profits, rather than half.&quot;Mallow laughed shortly, &quot;A fine offer. The whole of the trade on your termswould fall far below--a tenth share on mine. Try harder than that.&quot;<br />
&quot;You could have a council seat.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll have that anyway, without and despite you.&quot;With a sudden movement, Sutt clenched his fist, &quot;You could also saveyourself a prison term. Of twenty years, if I have my way. Count the profitin that.&quot;<br />
&quot;No profit at all, but can you fulfill such a threat?&quot;<br />
&quot;How about a trial for murder?&quot;<br />
&quot;Whose murder?&quot; asked Mallow, contemptuously.<br />
Sutt's voice was harsh now, though no louder than before, &quot;The murder of anAnacreonian priest, in the service of the Foundation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that so now? And what's your evidence?&quot;The secretary to the mayor leaned forward, &quot;Mallow, I'm not bluffing. Thepreliminaries are over. I have only to sign one final paper and the case ofthe Foundation versus Hober Mallow, Master Trader, is begun. You abandoneda subject of the Foundation to torture and death at the hands of an alienmob, Mallow, and you have only five seconds to prevent the punishment dueyou. For myself, I'd rather you decided to bluff it out. You'd be safer asa destroyed enemy, than as a doubtfully-converted friend.&quot;Mallow said solemnly, &quot;You have your wish.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; and the secretary smiled savagely. &quot;It was the mayor who wished thepreliminary attempt at compromise, not I. Witness that I did not try toohard.&quot;The door opened before him, and he left.<br />
Mallow looked up as Ankor Jael re-entered the room.<br />
Mallow said, &quot;Did you hear him?&quot;The politician flopped to the floor. &quot;I never heard him as angry as that,since I've known the snake.&quot;<br />
&quot;All right. What do you make of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I'll tell you. A foreign policy of domination through spiritualmeans is his idee fixe, but it's my notion that his ultimate aims aren'tspiritual. I was fired out of the Cabinet for arguing on the same issue, asI needn't tell you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You needn't. And what are those unspiritual aims according to yournotion?&quot;Jael grew serious, &quot;Well, he's not stupid, so he must see the bankruptcy ofour religious policy, which has hardly made a single conquest for us inseventy years. He's obviously using it for purposes of his own.<br />
&quot;Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerousweapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee thatthe weapon will never be turned on the user. For a hundred years now, we'vesupported a ritual and mythology that is becoming more and more venerable,traditional-- and immovable. In some ways, it isn't under our control anymore.&quot;<br />
&quot;In what ways?&quot; demanded Mallow. &quot;Don't stop. I want your thoughts.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, suppose one man, one ambitious man, uses the force of religionagainst us, rather than for us.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean Sutt?<br />
&quot;You're right. I mean Sutt. Listen, man, if he could mobilize the varioushierarchies on the subject planets against the Foundation in the name oforthodoxy, what chance would we stand? By planting himself at the head ofthe standards of the pious, he could make war on heresy, as represented byyou, for instance, and make himself king eventually. After all, it wasHardin who said: 'A nuclear blaster is a good weapon, but it can point bothways.'&quot;Mallow slapped his bare thigh, &quot;All right, Jael, then get me in thatcouncil, and I'll fight him.&quot;Jael paused, then said significantly, &quot;Maybe not. What was all that abouthaving a priest lynched? Is isn't true, is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's true enough,&quot; Mallow said, carelessly.<br />
Jael whistled, &quot;Has he definite proof?&quot;<br />
&quot;He should have.&quot; Mallow hesitated, then added, &quot;Jaim Twer was his man fromthe beginning, though neither of them knew that I knew that. And Jaim Twerwas an eyewitness.&quot;Jael shook his head. &quot;Uh-uh. That's bad.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bad? What's bad about it? That priest was illegally upon the planet by theFoundation's own laws. He was obviously used by the Korellian government asa bait, whether involuntary or not. By all the laws of common-sense, I hadno choice but one action--and that action was strictly within the law. Ifhe brings me to trial, he'll do nothing but make a prime fool of himself.&quot;And Jael shook his head again, &quot;No, Mallow, you've missed it. I told you heplayed dirty. He's not out to convict you; he knows he can't do that. Buthe is out to ruin your standing with the people. You heard what he said.<br />
Custom is higher than law, at times. You could walk out of the trialscot-free, but if the people think you threw a priest to the dogs, yourpopularity is gone.<br />
&quot;They'll admit you did the legal thing, even the sensible thing. But justthe same you'll have been, in their eyes, a cowardly dog, an unfeelingbrute, a hard-hearted monster. And you would never get elected to thecouncil. You might even lose your rating as Master Trader by having yourcitizenship voted away from you. You're not native born, you know. Whatmore do you think Sutt can want?&quot; Mallow frowned stubbornly, &quot;So!&quot; &quot;Myboy,&quot; said Jael. &quot;I'll stand by you, but I can't help. You're on the spot,–dead center.&quot;<br />
14<br />
The council chamber was full in a very literal sense on the fourth day ofthe trial of Hober Mallow, Master Trader. The only councilman absent wasfeebly cursing the fractured skull that had bedridden him. The gallerieswere filled to the aisleways and ceilings with those few of the crowd whoby influence, wealth, or sheer diabolic perseverance had managed to get in.<br />
The rest filled the square outside, in swarming knots about the open-airtrimensional 'visors.<br />
Ankor Jael made his way into the chamber with the near-futile aid andexertions of the police department, and then through the scarcely smallerconfusion within to Hober Mallow's seat.<br />
Mallow turned with relief, &quot;By Seldon, you cut it thin. Have you got it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Here, take it,&quot; said Jael. &quot;It's everything you asked for.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. How are they taking it outside?&quot;<br />
&quot;They're wild clear through.&quot; Jael stirred uneasily, &quot;You should never haveallowed public hearings. You could have stopped them.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn't want to.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's lynch talk. And Publis Manlio's men on the outer planets?<br />
&quot;I wanted to ask you about that, Jael. He's stirring up the Hierarchyagainst me, is he?&quot;<br />
&quot; Is he? It's the sweetest setup you ever saw, As Foreign Secretary, hehandles the prosecution in a case of interstellar law. As High Priest andPrimate of the Church, he rouses the fanatic hordes?<br />
&quot;Well, forget it. Do you remember that Hardin quotation you threw at melast month? We'll show them that the nuclear blaster can point both ways.&quot;The mayor was taking his seat now and the council members were rising inrespect.<br />
Mallow whispered, &quot;It's my turn today. Sit here and watch the fun.&quot;The day's proceedings began and fifteen minutes later, Hober Mallow steppedthrough a hostile whisper to the empty space before the mayor's bench. Alone beam of light centered upon him and in the public 'visors of the city,as well as on the myriads of private 'visors in almost every home of theFoundation's planets, the lonely giant figure of a man stared outdefiantly.<br />
He began easily and quietly, &quot;To save time, I will admit the truth of everypoint made against me by the prosecution. The story of the priest and themob as related by them is perfectly accurate in every detail.&quot;There was a stirring in the chamber and a triumphant mass-snarl from thegallery. He waited patiently for silence.<br />
&quot;However, the picture they presented fell short of completion. I ask theprivilege of supplying the completion in my own fashion. My story may seemirrelevant at first. I ask your indulgence for that.&quot;Mallow made no reference to the notes before him.<br />
&quot;I begin at the same time as the prosecution did; the day of my meetingwith Jorane Sutt and Jaim Twer. What went on at those meetings you know.<br />
The conversations have been described, and to that description I havenothing to add--except my own thoughts of that day.<br />
&quot;They were suspicious thoughts, for the events of that day were queer.<br />
Consider. Two people, neither of whom I knew more than casually, makeunnatural and somewhat unbelievable propositions to me. One, the secretaryto the mayor, asks me to play the part of intelligence agent to thegovernment in a highly confidential matter, the nature and importance ofwhich has already been explained to you. The other, self-styled leader of apolitical party, asks me to run for a council seat.<br />
&quot;Naturally I looked for the ulterior motive. Sutt's seemed evident. Hedidn't trust me. Perhaps he thought I was selling nuclear power to enemiesand plotting rebellion. And perhaps he was forcing the issue, or thought hewas. In that case, he would need a man of his own near me on my proposedmission, as a spy. The last thought, however, did not occur to me untillater on, when Jaim Twer came on the scene.<br />
&quot;Consider again: Twer presents himself as a trader, retired into politics,yet I know of no details of his trading career, although my knowledge ofthe field is immense. And further, although Twer boasted of a layeducation, he had never heard of a Seldon crisis.&quot;Hober Mallow waited to let the significance sink in and was rewarded withthe first silence he had yet encountered, as the gallery caught itscollective breath. That was for the inhabitants of Terminus itself. The menof the Outer Planets could hear only censored versions that would suit therequirements of religion. They would hear nothing of Seldon crises. Butthere would be further strokes they would not miss.<br />
Mallow continued:<br />
&quot;Who here can honestly state that any man with a lay education can possiblybe ignorant of the nature of a Seldon crisis? There is only one type ofeducation upon the Foundation that excludes all mention of the plannedhistory of Seldon and deals only with the man himself as a semi-mythicalwizard?<br />
&quot;I knew at that instant that Jaim Twer had never been a trader. I knew thenthat he was in holy orders and perhaps a full-fledged priest; and,doubtless, that for the three years he had pretended to head a politicalparty of the traders, he had been a bought man of Jorane Sutt.<br />
&quot;At the moment, I struck in the dark. I did not know Sun's purposes withregard to myself, but since he seemed to be feeding me rope liberally, Ihanded him a few fathoms of my own. My notion was that Twer was to be withme on my voyage as unofficial guardian on behalf of Jorane Sutt. Well, ifhe didn't get on, I knew well there'd be other devices waiting--and thoseothers I might not catch in time. A known enemy is relatively safe. Iinvited Twer to come with me. He accepted.<br />
&quot;That, gentlemen of the council, explains two things. First, it tells youthat Twer is not a friend of mine testifying against me reluctantly and forconscience' sake, as the prosecution would have you believe. He is a spy,performing his paid job. Secondly, it explains a certain action of mine onthe occasion of the first appearance of the priest whom I am accused ofhaving murdered-- an action as yet unmentioned, because unknown.&quot;Now there was a disturbed whispering in the council. Mallow cleared histhroat theatrically, and continued:<br />
&quot;I hate to describe my feelings when I first heard that we had a refugeemissionary on board. I even hate to remember them. Essentially, theyconsisted of wild uncertainty. The event struck me at the moment as a moveby Sutt, and passed beyond my comprehension or calculation. I was at sea--<br />
and completely.<br />
&quot;There was one thing I could do. I got rid of Twer for five minutes bysending him after my officers. In his absence, I set up a Visual Recordreceiver, so that whatever happened might be preserved for future study.<br />
This was in the hope, the wild but earnest hope, that what confused me atthe time might become plain upon review.<br />
&quot;I have gone over that Visual Record some fifty times since. I have it herewith me now, and will repeat the job a fifty-first time in your presenceright now.&quot;The mayor pounded monotonously for order, as the chamber lost itsequilibrium and the gallery roared. In five million homes on Terminus,excited observers crowded their receiving sets more closely, and at theprosecutor's own bench, Jorane Sutt shook his head coldly at the nervoushigh priest, while his eyes blazed fixedly on Mallow's face.<br />
The center of the chamber was cleared, and the lights burnt low. AnkorJael, from his bench on the left, made the adjustments, and with apreliminary click, a holographic scene sprang to view; in color, inthree-dimensions, in every attribute of life but life itself.<br />
There was the missionary, confused and battered, standing between thelieutenant and the sergeant. Mallow's image waited silently, and then menfiled in, Twer bringing up the rear.<br />
The conversation played itself out, word for word. The sergeant wasdisciplined, and the missionary was questioned. The mob appeared, theirgrowl could be heard, and the Revered Jord Parma made his wild appeal.<br />
Mallow drew his gun, and the missionary, as he was dragged away, lifted hisarms in a mad, final curse and a tiny flash of light came and went.<br />
The scene ended, with the officers frozen at the horror of the situation,while Twer clamped shaking hands over his ears, and Mallow calmly put hisgun away.<br />
The lights were on again; the empty space in the center of the floor was nolonger even apparently full. Mallow, the real Mallow of the present, tookup the burden of his narration:<br />
&quot;The incident, you see, is exactly as the prosecution has presented it--onthe surface. I'll explain that shortly. Jaim Twer's emotions through thewhole business shows clearly a priestly education, by the way.<br />
&quot;It was on that same day that I pointed out certain incongruities in theepisode to Twer. I asked him where the missionary came from in the midst ofthe near-desolate tract we occupied at the time. I asked further where thegigantic mob had come from with the nearest sizable town a hundred milesaway. The prosecution has paid no attention to such problems.<br />
&quot;Or to other points; for instance, the curious point of Jord Parma'sblatant conspicuousness. A missionary on Korell, risking his life indefiance of both Korellian and Foundation law, parades about in a very newand very distinctive priestly costume. There's something wrong there. Atthe time, I suggested that the missionary was an unwitting accomplice ofthe Commdor, who was using him in an attempt to force us into an act ofwildly illegal aggression, to justify, in law, his subsequent destructionof our ship and of us.<br />
&quot;The prosecution has anticipated this justification of my actions. Theyhave expected me to explain that the safety of my ship, my crew, my missionitself were at stake and could not be sacrificed for one man, when that manwould, in any case, have been destroyed, with us or without us. They replyby muttering about the Foundation's 'honor' and the necessity of upholdingour 'dignity' in order to maintain our ascendancy.<br />
&quot;For some strange reason, however, the prosecution has neglected Jord Parmahimself, –as an individual. They brought out no details concerning him;neither his birthplace, nor his education, nor any detail of previoushistory. The explanation of this will also explain the incongruities I havepointed out in the Visual Record you have just seen. The two are connected.<br />
&quot;The prosecution has advanced no details concerning Jord Parma because itcannot. That scene you saw by Visual Record seemed phoney because JordParma was phoney. There never was a Jord Parma. This whole trial is thebiggest farce ever cooked up over an issue that never existed.&quot;Once more he had to wait for the babble to die down. He said, slowly:<br />
&quot;I'm going to show you the enlargement of a single still from the VisualRecord. It will speak for itself. Lights again, Jael.&quot;The chamber dimmed, and the empty air filled again with frozen figures inghostly, waxen illusion. The officers of the Far Star struck their stiff,impossible attitudes. A gun pointed from Mallow's rigid hand. At his left,the Revered Jord Parma, caught in mid-shriek, stretched his claws upward,while the failing sleeves hung halfway.<br />
And from the missionary's hand there was that little gleam that in theprevious showing had flashed and gone. It was a permanent glow now.<br />
&quot;Keep your eye on that light on his hand,&quot; called Mallow from the shadows.<br />
&quot;Enlarge that scene, Jael!&quot;The tableau bloated quickly. Outer portions fell away as the missionarydrew towards the center and became a giant. Then there was only a hand andan arm, and then only a hand, which filled everything and remained there inimmense, hazy tautness.<br />
The light had become a set of fuzzy, glowing letters: K S P.<br />
&quot;That,&quot; Mallow's voice boomed out, &quot;is a sample of tatooing, gentlemen.<br />
Under ordinary light it is invisible, but under ultraviolet light--withwhich I flooded the room in taking this Visual Record, it stands out inhigh relief. I'll admit it is a naive method of secret identification, butit works on Korell, where UV light is not to be found on street comers.<br />
Even in our ship, detection was accidental.<br />
&quot;Perhaps some of you have already guessed what K S P stands for. Jord Parmaknew his priestly lingo well and did his job magnificently. Where he hadlearned it, and how, I cannot say, but K S P stands for 'Korellian SecretPolice.'&quot;Mallow shouted over the tumult, roaring against the noise, &quot;I havecollateral proof in the form of documents brought from Korell, which I canpresent to the council if required.<br />
&quot;And where is now the prosecution's case? They have already made andre-made the monstrous suggestion that I should have fought for themissionary in defiance of the law, and sacrificed my mission, my ship, andmyself to the 'honor' of the Foundation.<br />
&quot;But to do it for an impostor?<br />
&quot;Should I have done it then for a Korellian secret agent tricked out in therobes and verbal gymnastics probably borrowed of an Anacreonian exile?<br />
Would Jorane Sutt and Publis Manlio have had me fall into a stupid, odioustrap?<br />
His hoarsened voice faded into the featureless background of a shoutingmob. He was being lifted onto shoulders, and carried to the mayor's bench.<br />
Out the windows, he could see a torrent of madmen swarming into the squareto add to the thousands there already.<br />
Mallow looked about for Ankor Jael, but it was impossible to find anysingle face in the incoherence of the mass. Slowly he became aware of arhythmic, repeated shout, that was spreading from a small beginning, andpulsing into insanity:<br />
&quot;Long live Mallow-- long live Mallow-- long live Mallow?<br />
15<br />
Ankor Jael blinked at Mallow out of a haggard face. The last two days hadbeen mad, sleepless ones.<br />
&quot;Mallow, you've put on a beautiful show, so don't spoil it by jumping toohigh. You can't seriously consider running for mayor. Mob enthusiasm is apowerful thing, but it's notoriously fickle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; said Mallow, grimly, &quot;so we must coddle it, and the best way todo that is to continue the show.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
&quot;You're to have Publis Manlio and Jorane Sutt arrested?<br />
&quot;What!&quot;<br />
&quot;Just what you hear. Have the mayor arrest them! I don't care what threatsyou use. I control the mob, –for today, at any rate. He won't dare facethem.&quot;<br />
&quot;But on what charge, man?&quot;<br />
&quot;On the obvious one. They've been inciting the priesthood of the outerplanets to take sides in the factional quarrels of the Foundation. That'sillegal, by Seldon. Charge them with 'endangering the state.' And I don'tcare about a conviction any more than they did in my case. Just get themout of circulation until I'm mayor.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's half a year till election.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not too long!&quot; Mallow was on his feet, and his sudden grip of Jael's armwas tight. &quot;Listen, I'd seize the government by force if I had to--the waySalvor Hardin did a hundred years ago. There's still that Seldon crisiscoming up, and when it comes I have to be mayor and high priest. Both!&quot;Jael's brow furrowed. He said, quietly, &quot;What's it going to be? Korell,after all?&quot;Mallow nodded, &quot;Of course. They'll declare war, eventually, though I'mbetting it'll take another pair of years.&quot;<br />
&quot;With nuclear ships?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you think? Those three merchant ships we lost in their spacesector weren't knocked over with compressed-air pistols. Jael, they'regetting ships from the Empire itself. Don't open your mouth like a fool. Isaid the Empire! It's still there, you know. It many be gone here in thePeriphery but in the Galactic center it's still very much alive. And onefalse move means that it, itself, may be on our neck. That's why I must bemayor and high priest. I'm the only man who knows how to fight the crisis.&quot;Jael swallowed dryly, &quot;How? What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;Jael smiled uncertainly, &quot;Really! All of that!&quot;But Mallow's answer was incisive, &quot;When I'm boss of this Foundation, I'mgoing to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secretof this crisis.&quot;<br />
16<br />
Asper Argo, the Well-Beloved, Commdor of the Korellian Republic greeted hiswife's entry by a hangdog lowering of his scanty eyebrows. To her at least,his self-adopted epithet did not apply. Even he knew that.<br />
She said, in a voice as sleek as her hair and as cold as her eyes, &quot;Mygracious lord, I understand, has finally come to a decision upon the fateof the Foundation upstarts.&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot; said the Commdor, sourly. &quot;And what more does your versatileunderstanding embrace?&quot;<br />
&quot;Enough, my very noble husband. You had another of your vacillatingconsultations with your councilors. Fine advisors.&quot; With infinite scorn, &quot;Aherd of palsied purblind idiots hugging their sterile profits close totheir sunken chests in the face of my father's displeasure.&quot;<br />
&quot;And who, my dear,&quot; was the mild response, &quot;is the excellent source fromwhich your understanding understands all this?&quot;The Commdora laughed shortly, &quot;If I told you, my source would be morecorpse than source.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you'll have your own way, as always.&quot; The Commdor shrugged andturned away. &quot;And as for your father's displeasure: I much fear me itextends to a niggardly refusal to supply more ships.&quot;<br />
&quot;More ships!&quot; She blazed away, hotly, &quot;And haven't you five? Don't deny it.<br />
I know you have five; and a sixth is promised.&quot;<br />
&quot;Promised for the last year.&quot;<br />
&quot;But one--just one--can blast that Foundation into stinking rubble. Justone! One, to sweep their little pygmy boats out of space.&quot;<br />
&quot;I couldn't attack their planet, even with a dozen.&quot;<br />
&quot;And how long would their planet hold out with their trade ruined, andtheir cargoes of toys and trash destroyed?&quot; &quot;Those toys and trash meanmoney,&quot; he sighed. &quot;A good deal of money.&quot;<br />
&quot;But if you had the Foundation itself, would you not have all itcontained'? And if you had my father's respect and gratitude, would you nothave more than ever the Foundation could give you? It's been three years--<br />
more-- since that barbarian came with his magic sideshow. It's longenough.&quot;<br />
&quot;My dear!&quot; The Commdor turned and faced her. &quot;I am growing old. I am weary.<br />
I lack the resilience to withstand your rattling mouth. You say you knowthat I have decided. Well, I have. It is over, and there is war betweenKorell and the Foundation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well!&quot; The Commdora's figure expanded and her eyes sparkled, &quot;You learnedwisdom at last, though in your dotage. And now when you are master of thishinterland, you may be sufficiently respectable to be of some weight andimportance in the Empire. For one thing, we might leave this barbarousworld and attend the viceroy's court. Indeed we might.&quot;She swept out, with a smile, and a hand on her hip. Her hair gleamed in thelight.<br />
The Commdor waited, and then said to the closed door, with malignance andhate, &quot;And when I am master of what you call the hinterland, I may besufficiently respectable to do without your father's arrogance and hisdaughter's tongue. Completely--without!&quot;<br />
17<br />
The senior lieutenant of the Dark Nebula stared in horror at the visiplate.<br />
&quot;Great Galloping Galaxies!&quot; It should have been a howl, but it was awhisper instead, &quot;What's that?&quot;It was a ship, but a whale to the Dark Nebula's minnow; and on its side wasthe Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire. Every alarm on the ship yammeredhysterically.<br />
The orders went out, and the Dark Nebula prepared to run if it could, andfight if it must, –while down in the hyperwave room, a message stormed itsway through hyperspace to the Foundation.<br />
Over and over again! Partly a plea for help, but mainly a warning ofdanger.<br />
18<br />
Hober Mallow shuffled his feet wearily as he leafed through the reports.<br />
Two years of the mayoralty had made him a bit more housebroken, a bitsofter, a bit more patient, –but it had not made him learn to likegovernment reports and the mind-breaking officialese in which they werewritten.<br />
&quot;How many ships did they get?&quot; asked Jael.<br />
&quot;Four trapped on the ground. Two unreported. All others accounted for andsafe.&quot; Mallow grunted, &quot;We should have done better, but it's just ascratch.&quot;There was no answer and Mallow looked up, &quot;Does anything worry you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish Sutt would get here,&quot; was the almost irrelevant answer.<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, and now we'll hear another lecture on the home front.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, we won't,&quot; snapped Jael, &quot;but you're stubborn, Mallow. You may haveworked out the foreign situation to the last detail but you've never givena care about what goes on here on the home planet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that's your job, isn't it? What did I make you Minister of Educationand Propaganda for?&quot;<br />
&quot;Obviously to send me to an early and miserable grave, for all theco-operation you give me. For the last year, I've been deafening you withthe rising danger of Sutt and his Religionists. What good will your plansbe, if Sutt forces a special election and has you thrown out?&quot;<br />
&quot;None, I admit.&quot;<br />
&quot;And your speech last night just about handed the election to Sutt with asmile and a pat. Was there any necessity for being so frank?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn't there such a thing as stealing Sutt's thunder?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jael, violently, &quot;not the way you did it. You claim to haveforeseen everything, and don't explain why you traded with Korell to theirexclusive benefit for three years. Your only plan of battle is to retirewithout a battle. You abandon all trade with the sectors of space nearKorell. You openly proclaim a stalemate. You promise no offensive, even inthe future. Galaxy, Mallow, what am I supposed to do with such a mess?&quot;<br />
&quot;It lacks glamor?&quot;<br />
&quot;It lacks mob emotion-appeal.&quot;<br />
&quot;Same thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mallow, wake up. You have two alternatives. Either you present the peoplewith a dynamic foreign policy, whatever your private plans are, or you makesome sort of compromise with Sutt.&quot;Mallow said, &quot;All right, if I've failed the first, let's try the second.<br />
Sutt's just arrived.&quot;Sutt and Mallow had not met personally since the day of the trial, twoyears back. Neither detected any change in the other, except for thatsubtle atmosphere about each which made it quite evident that the roles ofruler and defier had changed.<br />
Sutt took his seat without shaking hands.<br />
Mallow offered a cigar and said, &quot;Mind if Jael stays? He wants a compromiseearnestly. He can act as mediator if tempers rise.&quot;Sutt shrugged, &quot;A compromise will be well for you. Upon another occasion Ionce asked you to state your terms. I presume the positions are reversednow.&quot;<br />
&quot;You presume correctly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then there are my terms. You must abandon your blundering policy ofeconomic bribery and trade in gadgetry, and return to the tested foreignpolicy of our fathers.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean conquest by missionary.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br />
&quot;No compromise short of that?&quot;<br />
&quot;None.&quot;<br />
&quot;Um-mmm.&quot; Mallow lit up very slowly and inhaled the tip of his cigar into abright glow. &quot;In Hardin's time, when conquest by missionary was new andradical, men like yourself opposed it. Now it is tried, tested, hallowed,–everything a Jorane Sutt would find well. But, tell me, how would you getus out of our present mess?&quot;<br />
&quot;Your present mess. I had nothing to do with it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Consider the question suitably modified.&quot;<br />
&quot;A strong offensive is indicated. The stalemate you seem to be satisfiedwith is fatal. It would be a confession of weakness to all the worlds ofthe Periphery, where the appearance of strength is all-important, andthere's not one vulture among them that wouldn't join the assault for itsshare of the corpse. You ought to understand that. You're from Smyrno,aren't you?&quot;Mallow passed over the significance of the remark. He said, &quot;And if youbeat Korell, what of the Empire? That is the real enemy.&quot;Sutt's narrow smile tugged at the comers of his mouth, &quot;Oh, no, yourrecords of your visit to Siwenna were complete. The viceroy of theNormannic Sector is interested in creating dissension in the Periphery forhis own benefit, but only as a side issue. He isn't going to stakeeverything on an expedition to the Galaxy's rim when he has fifty hostileneighbors and an emperor to rebel against. I paraphrase your own words.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yes he might, Sutt, if he thinks we're strong enough to be dangerous.<br />
And he might think so, if we destroy Korell by the main force of frontalattack. We'd have to be considerably more subtle.&quot;<br />
&quot;As for instance?<br />
Mallow leaned back, &quot;Sutt, I'll give you your chance. I don't need you, butI can use you. So I'll tell you what it's all about, and then you caneither join me and receive a place in a coalition cabinet, or you can playthe martyr and rot in jail.&quot;<br />
&quot;Once before you tried that last trick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not very hard, Sutt. The right time has only just come. Now listen.&quot;Mallow's eyes narrowed.<br />
&quot;When I first landed on Korell,&quot; he began, A bribed the Commdor with thetrinkets and gadgets that form the trader's usual stock. At the start,that. was meant only to get us entrance into a steel foundry. I had no planfurther than that, but in that I succeeded. I got what I wanted. But it wasonly after my visit to the Empire that I first realized exactly what aweapon I could build that trade into.<br />
&quot;This is a Seldon crisis we're facing, Sutt, and Seldon crises are notsolved by individuals but by historic forces. Hari Seldon, when he plannedour course of future history, did not count on brilliant heroics but on thebroad sweeps of economics and sociology. So the solutions to the variouscrises must be achieved by the forces that become available to us at thetime.<br />
&quot;In this case, –trade!&quot;Sutt raised his eyebrows skeptically and took advantage of the pause, &quot;Ihope I am not of subnormal intelligence, but the fact is that your vaguelecture isn't very illuminating.&quot;<br />
&quot;It will become so,&quot; said Mallow. &quot;Consider that until now the power oftrade has been underestimated. It has been thought that it took apriesthood under our control to make it a powerful weapon. That is not so,and this is my contribution to the Galactic situation. Trade withoutpriests! Trade alone! It is strong enough. Let us become very simple andspecific. Korell is now at war with us. Consequently our trade with her hasstopped. But, –notice that I am making this as simple as a problem inaddition, –in the past three years she has based her economy more and moreupon the nuclear techniques which we have introduced and which only we cancontinue to supply. Now what do you suppose will happen once the tinynuclear generators begin failing, and one gadget after another goes out ofcommission?<br />
&quot;The small household appliances go first. After a half a year of thisstalemate that you abhor, a woman's nuclear knife won't work any more. Herstove begins failing. Her washer doesn't do a good job. Thetemperature-humidity control in her house dies on a hot summer day. Whathappens?&quot;He paused for an answer, and Sutt said calmly, &quot;Nothing. People endure agood deal in war.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very true. They do. They'll send their sons out in unlimited numbers todie horribly on broken spaceships. They'll bear up under enemy bombardment,if it means they have to live on stale bread and foul water in caves half amile deep. But it's very hard to bear up under little things when thepatriotic uplift of imminent danger is not present. It's going to, be astalemate. There will be no casualties, no bombardments, no battles.<br />
&quot;There will just be a knife that won't cut, and a stove that won't cook,and a house that freezes in the winter. It will be annoying, and peoplewill grumble.&quot;Sutt said slowly, wonderingly, &quot;Is that what you're setting your hopes on,man? What do you expect? A housewives' rebellion? A Jacquerie? A suddenuprising of butchers and grocers with their cleavers and bread-knivesshouting 'Give us back our Automatic Super-Kleeno Nuclear WashingMachines.'&quot;<br />
&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Mallow, impatiently, &quot;I do not. I expect, however, ageneral background of grumbling and dissatisfaction which will be seized onby more important figures later on.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what more important figures are these?&quot;<br />
&quot;The manufacturers, the factory owners, the industrialists of Korell. Whentwo years of the stalemate have gone, the machines in the factories will,one by one, begin to fail. Those industries which we have changed fromfirst to last with our new nuclear gadgets will find themselves verysuddenly ruined. The heavy industries will find themselves, en masse and ata stroke, the owners of nothing but scrap machinery that won't work.&quot;<br />
&quot;The factories ran well enough before you came there, Mallow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Sutt, so they did--at about one-twentieth the profits, even if youleave out of consideration the cost of reconversion to the originalpre-nuclear state. With the industrialist and financier and the average manall against him, how long will the Commdor hold out?&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as he pleases, as soon as it occurs to him to get new nucleargenerators from the Empire.&quot;And Mallow laughed joyously, &quot;You've missed, Sutt, missed as badly as theCommdor himself. You've missed everything, and understood nothing. Look,man, the Empire can replace nothing. The Empire has always been a realm ofcolossal resources. They've calculated everything in planets, in stellarsystems, in whole sectors of the Galaxy. Their generators are giganticbecause they thought in gigantic fashion.<br />
&quot;But we,--we , our little Foundation, our single world almost withoutmetallic resources, –have had to work with brute economy. Our generatorshave had to be the size of our thumb, because it was all the metal we couldafford. We had to develop new techniques and new methods, –techniques andmethods the Empire can't follow because they have degenerated past thestage where they can make any really vital scientific advance.<br />
&quot;With all their nuclear shields, large enough to protect a ship, a city, anentire world; they could never build one to protect a single man. To supplylight and heat to a city, they have motors six stories high, –I saw them--<br />
where ours could fit into this room. And when I told one of their nuclearspecialists that a lead container the size of a walnut contained a nucleargenerator, he almost choked with indignation on the spot.<br />
&quot;Why, they don't even understand their own colossi any longer. The machineswork from generation to generation automatically, and the caretakers are ahereditary caste who would be helpless if a single D-tube in all that vaststructure burnt out.<br />
&quot;The whole war is a battle between those two systems, between the Empireand the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of aworld, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack alleconomic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things,useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.<br />
&quot;A king, or a Commdor, will take the ships and even make war. Arbitraryrulers throughout history have bartered their subjects' welfare for whatthey consider honor, and glory, and conquest. But it's still the littlethings in life that count--and Asper Argo won't stand up against theeconomic depression that will sweep all Korell in two or three years.&quot;Sutt was at the window, his back to Mallow and Jael. It was early eveningnow, and the few stars that struggled feebly here at the very rim of theGalaxy sparked against the background of the misty, wispy Lens thatincluded the remnants of that Empire, still vast, that fought against them.<br />
Sutt said, &quot;No. You are not the man.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don't believe me?&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean I don't trust you. You're smooth-tongued. You befooled me properlywhen I thought I had you under proper care on your first trip to Korell.<br />
When I thought I had you cornered at the trial, you wormed your way out ofit and into the mayor's chair by demagoguery. There is nothing straightabout you; no motive that hasn't another behind it; no statement thathasn't three meanings.<br />
&quot;Suppose you were a traitor. Suppose your visit to the Empire had broughtyou a subsidy and a promise of power. Your actions would be precisely whatthey are now. You would bring about a war after having strengthened theenemy. You would force the Foundation into inactivity. And you wouldadvance a plausible explanation of everything, one so plausible it wouldconvince everyone.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean there'll be no compromise?&quot; asked Mallow, gently.<br />
&quot;I mean you must get out, by free will or force.&quot;<br />
&quot;I warned you of the only alternative to co-operation.&quot;Jorane Sutt's face congested with blood in a sudden access of emotion. &quot;AndI warn you, Hober Mallow of Smyrno, that if you arrest me, there will be noquarter. My men will stop nowhere in spreading the truth about you, and thecommon people of the Foundation will unite against their foreign ruler.<br />
They have a consciousness of destiny that a Smyrnian can never understand--<br />
and that consciousness will destroy you.&quot;Hober Mallow said quietly to the two guards who had entered, &quot;Take himaway. He's under arrest.&quot;Sutt said, &quot;Your last chance.&quot;Mallow stubbed out his cigar and never looked up.<br />
And five minutes later, Jael stirred and said, wearily, &quot;Well, now thatyou've made a martyr for the cause, what next?&quot;Mallow stopped playing with the ash tray and looked up, &quot;That's not theSutt I used to know. He's a blood-blind bull. Galaxy, he hates me.&quot;<br />
&quot;All the more dangerous then.&quot;<br />
&quot;More dangerous? Nonsense! He's lost all power of judgement.&quot;Jael said grimly, &quot;You're overconfident, Mallow. You're ignoring thepossibility of a popular rebellion.&quot;Mallow looked up, grim in his turn, &quot;Once and for all, Jael, there is nopossibility of a popular rebellion.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're sure of yourself!&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sure of the Seldon crisis and the historical validity of theirsolutions, externally and internally. There are some things I didn't tellSuit right now. He tried to control the Foundation itself by religiousforces as he controlled the outer worlds, and he failed, –which is thesurest sign that in the Seldon scheme, religion is played out.<br />
&quot;Economic control worked differently. And to paraphrase that famous SalvorHardin quotation of yours, it's a poor nuclear blaster that won't pointboth ways. If Korell prospered with our trade, so did we. If Korellianfactories fail without our trade; and if the prosperity of the outer worldsvanishes with commercial isolation; so will our factories fail and ourprosperity vanish.<br />
&quot;And there isn't a factory, not a trading center. not a shipping line thatisn't under my control; that I couldn't squeeze to nothing if Sutt attemptsrevolutionary propaganda. Where his propaganda succeeds, or even looks asthough it might succeed, I will make certain that prosperity dies. Where itfails, prosperity will continue, because my factories will remain fullystaffed.<br />
&quot;So by the same reasoning which makes me sure that the Korellians willrevolt in favor of prosperity, I am sure we will not revolt against it. Thegame will be played out to its end.&quot;<br />
&quot;So then,&quot; said Jael, &quot;you're establishing a plutocracy. You're making us aland of traders and merchant princes. Then what of the future?&quot;Mallow lifted his gloomy face, and exclaimed fiercely, &quot;What business ofmine is the future? No doubt Seldon has foreseen it and prepared againstit. There will be other crises in the time to come when money power hasbecome as dead a force as religion is now. Let my successors solve thosenew problems, as I have solved the one of today.&quot;KORELL?..And so after three years of a war which was certainly the mostunfought war on record, the Republic of Korell surrendered unconditionally,and Hober Mallow took his place next to Hari Seldon and Salvor Hardin inthe hearts of the people of the Foundation.<br />
ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA??????????????????? ABOUT THE AUTHORIsaac Asimov was born in the Soviet union to his great surprise. He movedquickly to correct the situation. When his parents emigrated to the UnitedStates, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage.<br />
He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.<br />
Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventuallyfound his way to Columbia University and, over the protests of the schooladministration, managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry, up toand including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University and climbed theacademic ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himselfProfessor of Biochemistry.<br />
Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in theinanimate sense) when he discovered his first science-fiction magazine. Bythe time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen, heactually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After fourlong months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and,thereafter, he never looked back.<br />
In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story&quot;Nightfall&quot; and his future was assured. Shortly before that he had begunwriting his robot stories, and shortly after that he had begun hisFoundation series.<br />
What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over260 books, distributed through every major division of the Dewey system oflibrary classification, and shows no signs of slowing up. He remains asyouthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome witheach year. You can be sure that this is so since he has written this littleessay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious.<br />
He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two childrenby a previous marriage, and lives in New York City.
