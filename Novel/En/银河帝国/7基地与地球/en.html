Part Six - Alpha Chapter 16: The Center of the Worlds <br />

69Trevize stared at Pelorat for a long moment, and withan expression of clear displeasure. Then he said, &quot;Is there somethingyou saw that I did not, and that you did not tell me about?&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; answered Pelorat mildly. &quot;You saw it and, as I just said,I tried to explain, but you were in no mood to listen to me.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, try again.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Don't bully him, Trevize.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm not bullying him. I'm asking for information. And don't youbaby him.&quot;<br>

&quot;Please,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;listen to me, will you, and not to eachother. Do you remember, Golan, that we discussed early attemptsto discover the origin of the human species? Yariff's project? Youknow, trying to plot the times of settlement of various planets on theassumption that planets would be settled outward from the world of originin all directions alike. Then, as we moved from newer to older planets,we would approach the world of origin from all directions.&quot;Trevize nodded impatiently. &quot;What I remember is that it didn't workbecause the dates of settlement were not reliable.&quot;<br>

&quot;That's right, old fellow. But the worlds that Yariff was workingwith were part of the second expansion of the human race. By then,hyperspatial travel was far advanced, and settlement must have grown quiteragged. Leapfrogging very long distances was very simple and settlementdidn't necessarily proceed outward in radial symmetry. That surely addedto the problem of unreliable dates of settlement.
<br>&quot;But just think for a moment, Golan, of the Spacer worlds. Theywere in the first wave of settlement. Hyperspatial travel was lessadvanced then, and there was probably little or no leapfrogging. Whereasmillions of worlds were settled, perhaps chaotically, during the secondexpansion, only fifty were settled, probably in an orderly manner, inthe first. Whereas the millions of worlds of the second expansion weresettled over a period of twenty thousand years; the fifty of the firstexpansion were settled over a period of a few centuries almostinstantaneously, in comparison. Those fifty, taken together, shouldexist in roughly spherical symmetry about the world of origin.
<br>&quot;We have the co-ordinates of the fifty worlds. You photographed them,remember, from the statue. Whatever or whoever it is that is destroyinginformation that concerns Earth, either overlooked those co-ordinates, ordidn't stop to think that they would give us the information we need. Allyou have to do, Golan, is to adjust the co-ordinates to allow for thelast twenty thousand years of stellar motions, then find the center ofthe sphere. You'll end up fairly close to Earth's sun, or at least towhere it was twenty thousand years ago.&quot;Trevize's mouth had fallen slightly open during the recital and ittook a few moments for him to close it after Pelorat was done. He said,&quot;Now why didn't I think of that?&quot;<br>

&quot;I tried to tell you while we were still on Melpomenia.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm sure you did. I apologize, Janov, for refusing to listen. Thefact is it didn't occur to me that &quot; He paused in embarrassment.
<br>Pelorat chuckled quietly, &quot;That I could have anything of importanceto say. I suppose that ordinarily I wouldn't, but this was somethingin my own field, you see. I am sure that, as a general rule, you'd beperfectly justified in not listening to me.&quot;<br>

&quot;Never,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;That's not so, Janov. I feel like a fool,and I well deserve the feeling. My apologies again and I must nowget to the computer.&quot;He and Pelorat walked into the pilot-room, and Pelorat, as always,watched with a combination of marveling and incredulity as Trevize'shands settled down upon the desk, and he became what was almost a singleman computer organism.
<br>&quot;I'll have to make certain assumptions, Janov,&quot; said Trevize, ratherblankfaced from computer-absorption. &quot;I have to assume that the firstnumber is a distance in parsecs, and that the other two numbers are anglesin radians, the first being up and down, so to speak, and the other,right and left. I have to assume that the use of plus and minus in thecase of the angles is Galactic Standard and that the zero-zzzzzzzzz markis Melpomenia's sun.&quot;<br>

&quot;That sounds fair enough,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;Does it? There are six possible ways of arranging the numbers, fourpossible ways of arranging the signs, distances may be in light-yearsrather than parsecs, the angles in degrees, rather than radians. That'sninety-six diferent variations right there. Add to that, the point thatif the distances are light-years, I'm uncertain as to the length of theyear used. Add also the fact that I don't know the actual conventionsused to measure the angles from the Melpomenian equator in one case,I suppose, but what's their prime meridian?&quot;Pelorat frowned. &quot;Now you make it sound hopeless.&quot;<br>

&quot;Not hopeless. Aurora and Solaria are included in the list, and Iknow where they are in space. I'll use the co-ordinates, and see ifI can locate them. If I end up in the wrong place, I will adjust theco-ordinates until they give me the right place, and that will tell mewhat mistaken assumptions I am making as far as the standards governingthe co-ordinates are concerned. Once my assumptions are corrected,I can look for the center of the sphere.&quot;<br>

&quot;With all the possibilities for change, won't it make it difficultto decide what to do?&quot;<br>

&quot;What?&quot; said Trevize. He was increasingly absorbed. Then, whenPelorat repeated the question, he said, &quot;Oh well, chances are that theco-ordinates follow the Galactic Standard and adjusting for an unknownprime meridian isn't difficult. These systems for locating points in spacewere worked out long ago, and most astronomers are pretty confident theyeven antedate interstellar travel. Human beings are very conservativein some ways and virtually never change numerical conventions once theygrow used to them. They even come to mistake them for laws of nature,I think. Which is just as well, for if every world had its ownconventions of measurement that changed every century, I honestly thinkscientific endeavor would stall and come to a permanent stop.&quot;He was obviously working while he was talking, for his words camehaltingly. And now he muttered, &quot;But quiet now.&quot;After that, his face grew furrowed and concentrated until, afterseveral minutes, he leaned back and drew a long breath. He said quietly,&quot;The conventions hold. I've located Aurora. There's no question aboutit. See?&quot;Pelorat stared at the field of stars, and at the bright one near thecenter and said, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;My own opinion doesn't matter. Thecomputer is sure. We've visited Aurora, after all. We haveits characteristics its diameter, mass, luminosity, temperature,spectral details, to say nothing of the pattern of neighboring stars. Thecomputer says it's Aurora.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then I suppose we must take its word for it.&quot;<br>

&quot;Believe me, we must. Let me adjust the viewscreen and the computercan get to work. It has the fifty sets of co-ordinates and it will usethem one at a time.&quot;Trevize was working on the screen as he spoke. The computer worked inthe four dimensions of space-time routinely, but, for human inspection,the viewscreen was rarely needed in more than two dimensions. Now thescreen seemed to unfold into a dark volume as deep as it, was tall andbroad. Trevize dimmed the room lights almost totally to make the viewof star-shine easier to observe.
<br>&quot;It will begin now,&quot; he whispered.
<br>A moment later, a star appeared then another thenanother. The view on the screen shifted with every addition so that allmight be included. It was as though space was moving backward from theeye so that a more and more panoramic view could be taken. Combine thatwith shifts up or down, right or left Eventually, fifty dots of light appeared, hovering in three-dimensionalspace.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;I would have appreciated a beautiful sphericalarrangement, but this looks like the skeleton of a snowball that hadbeen patted into shape in a big hurry, out of snow that was too hardand gritty.&quot;<br>

&quot;Does that ruin everything?&quot;<br>

&quot;It introduces some difficulties, but that can't be helped, Isuppose. The stars themselves aren't uniformly distributed, and certainlyhabitable planets aren't, so there are bound to be unevennesses in theestablishment of new worlds. The computer will adjust each of thosedots to its present position, allowing for its likely motion in thelast twenty thousand years even in that time it won't mean muchof an adjustment and then fit them all into a `best-sphere.' Itwill find a spherical surface, in other words, from which the distanceof all the dots is a minimum. Then we find the center of the sphere,and Earth should be fairly close to that center. Or so we hope. Itwon't take long.&quot;70It didn't. Trevize, who was used to accepting miraclesfrom the computer, found himself astonished at how little time ittook.
<br>Trevize had instructed the computer to sound a soft, reverberatingnote upon deciding upon the co-ordinates of the best-center. There wasno reason for that, except for the satisfaction of hearing it and knowingthat perhaps the search had been ended.
<br>The sound came in a matter of minutes, and was like the gentlestroking of a mellow gong. It swelled till they could feel the vibrationphysically, and then slowly faded.
<br>Bliss appeared at the door almost at once. &quot;What's that?&quot; she asked,her eyes big. &quot;An emergency?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Not at all.&quot;Pelorat added eagerly, &quot;We may have located Earth, Bliss. That soundwas the computer's way of saying so.&quot;She walked into the room. &quot;I might have been warned.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I'm sorry, Bliss. I didn't mean it to be quite thatloud.&quot;Fallom had followed Bliss into the room and said, &quot;Why was there thatsound, Bliss?&quot;<br>

&quot;I see she's curious, too,&quot; said Trevize. He sat back, feelingdrained. The next step was to try the finding on the real Galaxy, tofocus on the coordinates of the center of the Spacer worlds and see if aG-type star was actually present. Once again, he was reluctant to takethe obvious step, unable to make himself put the possible solution tothe actual test.
<br>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Why shouldn't she? She's as human as we are.&quot;<br>

&quot;Her parent wouldn't have thought so,&quot; said Trevize abstractedly. &quot;Iworry about the kid. She's bad news.&quot;<br>

&quot;In what way has she proven so?&quot; demanded Bliss.
<br>Trevize spread his arms. &quot;Just a feeling.&quot;Bliss gave him a disdainful look, and turned to Fallom. &quot;We are tryingto locate Earth, Fallom.&quot; ,&quot;What's Earth?&quot;<br>

&quot;Another world, but a special one. It's the world our ancestors camefrom. Do you know what the word `ancestors' means from your reading,Fallom?&quot;<br>

&quot;Does it mean&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&quot; But the last word was not inGalactic.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;That's an archaic word for `ancestors,' Bliss. Our word`forebears' is closer to it.&quot;<br>

&quot;Very well,&quot; said Bliss, with a sudden brilliant smile. &quot;Earth is theworld where our forebears came from, Fallom. Yours and mine and Pel'sand Trevize's.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yours, Bliss and mine also.&quot; Fallom sounded puzzled. &quot;Bothof them?&quot;<br>

&quot;There's just one set of forebears,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;We had the sameforebears, all of us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It sounds to me as though the child knows very wellthat she's different from us.&quot;Bliss said to Trevize in a low voice, &quot;Don't say that. She must bemade to see she isn't. Not in essentials.&quot;<br>

&quot;Hermaphrodism is essential, I should think.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm talking about the mind.&quot;<br>

&quot;Transducer-lobes are essential, too.&quot;<br>

&quot;Now, Trevize, don't be difficult. She's intelligent and humanregardless of details.&quot;She turned to Fallom, her voice rising to its normal level. &quot;Thinkquietly about this, Fallom, and see what it means to you. Your forebearsand mine were the same. All the people on all the worlds many,many worlds all had the same forebears, and those forebears livedoriginally on the world named Earth. That means we're all relatives,doesn't it? Now go back to our room and think of that.&quot;Fallom, after bestowing a thoughtful look on Trevize, turned and ranoff, hastened on by Bliss's affectionate slap on her backside.
<br>Bliss turned to Trevize, and said, &quot;Please, Trevize, promise me youwon't make any comments in her hearing that will lead her to think she'sdifferent from us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I promise. I have no wish to impede or subvert theeducational procedure, but, you know, she is different from us.&quot;<br>

&quot;In ways. As I'm different from you, and as Pel is.&quot;<br>

&quot;Don't be naïve, Bliss. The differences in Fallom's case aremuch greater.&quot;<br>

&quot;A little greater. The similarities are vastly moreimportant. She, and her people, will be part of Galaxia some day, anda very useful part, I'm sure.&quot;<br>

&quot;All right. We won't argue.&quot; He turned to the computer with clearreluctance. &quot;And meanwhile, I'm afraid I have to check the supposedposition of Earth in real space.&quot;<br>

&quot;Afraid?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well,&quot; Trevize lifted his shoulders in what he hoped was ahalf-humorous way, &quot;what if there's no suitable star near the place?&quot;<br>

&quot;Then there isn't,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;I'm wondering if there's any point in checking it out now. We won'tbe able to make a Jump for several days.&quot;<br>

&quot;And you'll be spending them agonizing over the possibilities. Findout now. Waiting won't change matters.&quot;Trevize sat there with his lips compressed for a moment, then said,&quot;You're right. Very well, then here goes.&quot;He turned to the computer, placed his hands on the handmarks on thedesk, and the viewscreen went dark.
<br>Bliss said, &quot;I'll leave you, then. I'll make you nervous if Istay.&quot; She left, with a wave of her hand.
<br>&quot;The thing is,&quot; he muttered, &quot;that we're going to be checking thecomputer's Galactic map first and even if Earth's sun is in the calculatedposition, the map should not include it. But we'll then &quot;His voice trailed off in astonishment as the viewscreen flashedwith a background of stars. These were fairly numerous and dim, with anoccasional brighter one sparkling here and there, well scattered overthe face of the screen. But quite close to the center was a star thatwas brighter than all the rest.
<br>&quot;We've got it,&quot; said Pelorat jubilantly. &quot;We've got it, old chap. Lookhow bright it is.&quot;<br>

&quot;Any star at centered co-ordinates would look bright,&quot; said Trevize,clearly trying to fight off any initial jubilation that might proveunfounded. &quot;The view, after all, is presented from a distance of a parsecfrom the centered co-ordinates. Still, that centered star certainly isn'ta red dwarf, or a red giant, or a hot blue-white. Wait for information;the computer is checking its data banks.&quot;There was silence for a few seconds and then Trevize said,&quot;Spectral class G-2.&quot; Another pause, then, &quot;Diameter, 1.4 millionkilometers mass, 1.02 times that of Terminus's sun surfacetemperature, 6,000 absolute rotation slow, just under thirtydays no unusual activity or irregularity.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Isn't all that typical of the kind of star about whichhabitable planets are to be found?&quot;<br>

&quot;Typical,&quot; said Trevize, nodding in the dimness. &quot;And, therefore,what we'd expect Earth's sun to be like. If that is where life developed,the sun of Earth would have set the original standard.&quot;<br>

&quot;So there is a reasonable chance that there would be a habitableplanet circling it.&quot;<br>

&quot;We don't have to speculate about that,&quot; said Trevize, who soundedpuzzled indeed over the matter. &quot;The Galactic map lists it as possessinga planet with human life but with a question mark.&quot;Pelorat's enthusiasm grew. &quot;That's exactly what we would expect,Golan. The life-bearing planet is there, but the attempt to hide thefact obscures data concerning it and leaves the makers of the map thecomputer uses uncertain.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, that's what bothers me,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;That's not what we shouldexpect. We should expect far more than that. Considering the efficiencywith which data concerning Earth has been wiped out, the makers of themap should not have known that life exists in the system, let alonehuman life. They should not even have known Earth's sun exists. TheSpacer worlds aren't on the map. Why should Earth's sun be?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, it's there, just the same. What's the use of arguing thefact? What other information about the star is given?&quot;<br>

&quot;A name.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah! What is it?&quot;<br>

&quot;Alpha.&quot;There was a short pause, then Pelorat said eagerly, &quot;That's it,old man. That's the final bit of evidence. Consider the meaning.&quot;<br>

&quot;Does it have a meaning?&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It's just a name to me,and an odd one. It doesn't sound Galactic.&quot;<br>

&quot;It isn't Galactic. It's in a prehistoric language ofEarth, the same one that gave us Gaia as the name of Bliss's planet.&quot;<br>

&quot;What does Alpha mean, then?&quot;<br>

&quot;Alpha is the first letter of the alphabet of that ancientlanguage. That is one of the most firmly attested scraps of knowledgewe have about it. In ancient times, `alpha' was sometimes used to meanthe first of anything. To call a sun `Alpha,' implies that it's thefirst sun. And wouldn't the first sun be the one around which a planetrevolved that was the first planet to bear human life Earth?&quot;<br>

&quot;Are you sure of that?&quot;<br>

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;Is there anything in early legends you're the mythologist,after all that gives Earth's sun some very unusual attribute?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, how can there be? It has to be standard by definition, and thecharacteristics the computer has given us ate as standard as possible,I imagine. Aren't they?&quot;<br>

&quot;Earth's sun is a single star, I suppose?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Well, of course! As far as I know, all inhabited worldsorbit single stars.&quot;<br>

&quot;So I would have thought myself,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The trouble isthat that star in the center of the viewscreen is not a single star,it is a binary. The brighter of the two stars making up the binary isindeed standard and it is that one for which the computer supplied uswith data. Circling that star with a period of roughly eighty years,however, is another star with a mass four-fifths that of the brighterone. We can't see the two as separate stars with the unaided eye, butif I were to enlarge the view, I'm sure we would.&quot;<br>

&quot;Are you certain of that, Golan?&quot; said Pelorat, taken aback.
<br>&quot;It's what the computer is telling me. And if we are looking at abinary star, then it's not Earth's sun. It can't be.&quot;71.
<br>Trevize broke contact with the computer, and the lightsbrightened.
<br>That was the signal, apparently, for Bliss to return, with Fallomtagging after her. &quot;Well, then, what are the results?&quot; she asked.
<br>Trevize said tonelessly, &quot;Somewhat disappointing. Where I expectedto find Earth's sun, I found a binary star, instead. Earth's sun is asingle star, so the one centered is not it.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Now what, Golan?&quot;Trevize shrugged. &quot;I didn't really expect to see Earth's suncentered. Even the Spacers wouldn't settle worlds in such a way as toset up an exact sphere. Aurora, the oldest of the Spacer worlds, mighthave sent out settlers of its own and that may have distorted the sphere,too. Then, too, Earth's sun may not have moved at precisely the averagevelocity of the Spacer worlds.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;So the Earth can be anywhere. Is that what you'resaying?&quot;<br>

&quot;No. Not quite `anywhere.' All these possible sources of error can'tamount to much. Earth's sun must be in the vicinity of theco-ordinates. The star we've spotted almost exactly at the co-ordinatesmust be a neighbor of Earth's sun. It's startling that there should bea neighbor that so closely resembles Earth's sun except for beinga binary but that must be the case.&quot;<br>

&quot;But we would see Earth's sun on the map, then, wouldn't we? I mean,near Alpha?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, for I'm certain Earth's sun isn't on the map at all. It was thatwhich shook my confidence when we first spied Alpha. Regardless of howmuch it might resemble Earth's sun, the mere fact that it was on themap made me suspect it was not the real thing.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Why not concentrate on the same co-ordinatesin real space? Then, if there is any bright star close to the center,a star that does not exist in the computer's map, and if it is verymuch like Alpha in its properties, but is single, might it not beEarth's sun?&quot;Trevize sighed. &quot;If all that were so, I'd be willing to wager halfmy fortune, such as it is, that circling that star you speak of wouldbe the planet Earth. Again, I hesitate to try.&quot;<br>

&quot;Because you might fail?&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;However,&quot; he said, &quot;just give me a moment or two tocatch my breath, and I'll force myself to do so.&quot;And while the three adults looked at each other, Fallom approachedthe computer-desk and stared curiously at the handmarks upon it. Shereached out her own hand tentatively toward the markings, and Trevizeblocked the motion with a swift outthrusting of his own arm and a sharp,&quot;Mustn't touch, Fallom.&quot;The young Solarian seemed startled, and retreated to the comfort ofBliss's encircling arm.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;We must face it, Golan. What if you find nothing inreal space?&quot;<br>

&quot;Then we will be forced to go back to the earlier plan,&quot; said Trevize,&quot;and visit each of the forty-seven Spacer worlds in turn.&quot;<br>

&quot;And if that yields nothing, Golan?&quot;Trevize shook his head in annoyance, as though to prevent that thoughtfrom taking too deep a root. Staring down at his knees, he said abruptly,&quot;Then I will think of something else.&quot;<br>

&quot;But what if there is no world of forebears at all?&quot;Trevize looked up sharply at the treble voice. &quot;Who said that?&quot; heasked.
<br>It was a useless question. The moment of disbelief faded, and he knewvery well who the questioner was.
<br>&quot;I did,&quot; said Fallom.
<br>Trevize looked at her with a slight frown. &quot;Did you understand theconversation?&quot;Fallom said, &quot;You are looking for the world of forebears, but youhaven't found it yet. Maybe there isn't no such world.&quot;<br>

&quot; Any such world,&quot; said Bliss softly.
<br>&quot;No, Fallom,&quot; said Trevize seriously. &quot;There has been a very bigeffort to hide it. To try so hard to hide something means there issomething there to hide. Do you understand what I am saying?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Fallom. &quot;You do not let me touch the hands on the deck.
<br>Because you do not let me do that means it would be interesting totouch them.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah, but not for you, Fallom. Bliss, you are creating a monsterthat will destroy us all. Don't ever let her in here unless I'm at thedesk. And even then, think twice, will you?&quot;The small byplay, however, seemed to have shaken him out of hisirresolution. He said, &quot;Obviously, I had better get to work. If I justsit here, uncertain as to what to do, that little fright will take overthe ship.&quot;The lights dimmed, and Bliss said in a low voice, &quot;You promised,Trevize. Do not call her a monster or a fright in her hearing.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then keep an eye on her, and teach her some manners. Tell her childrenshould be never heard and seldom seen.&quot;Bliss frowned. &quot;Your attitude toward children is simply appalling,Trevize.&quot;<br>

&quot;Maybe, but this is not the time to discuss the matter.&quot;Then he said, in tones in which satisfaction and relief were equallyrepresented, &quot;There's Alpha again in real space. And to its left,and slightly upward, is almost as bright a star and one that isn't inthe computer's Galactic map. That is Earth's sun. I'llwager all my fortune on it.&quot;72&quot;Well, now,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;we won't take any part ofyour fortune if you lose, so why not settle the matter in a forthrightmanner? Let's visit the star as soon as you can make the Jump.&quot;Trevize shook his head. &quot;No. This time it's not a matter ofirresolution or fear. It's a matter of being careful. Three times we'vevisited an unknown world and three times we've come up against somethingunexpectedly dangerous. And three times, moreover, we've had to leavethat world in a hurry. This time the matter is ultimately crucial andI will not play my cards in ignorance again; or at least in any moreignorance than I can help. So far, all we have are vague stories aboutradioactivity, and that is not enough. By an odd chance that no one couldhave anticipated, there is a planet with human life about a parsec fromEarth &quot;<br>

&quot;Do we really know that Alpha has a planet with human life on it?&quot; putin Pelorat. &quot;You said the computer placed a question mark after that.&quot;<br>

&quot;Even so,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;it's worth trying. Why not take a look atit? If it does indeed have human beings on it, let us find out what theyknow about Earth. For them, after all, Earth is not a distant thing oflegend; it is a neighbor world, bright and prominent in their sky.&quot;Bliss said thoughtfully, &quot;It's not a bad idea. It occurs to me thatif Alpha is inhabited and if the inhabitants are not your thoroughlytypical Isolates, they may be friendly, and we might be able to get somedecent food for a change.&quot;<br>

&quot;And meet some pleasant people,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Don't forget that. Willit be all right with you, Janov?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;You make the decision, old chap. Wherever you go,I will go, too.&quot;Fallom said suddenly, &quot;Will we find Jemby?&quot;Bliss said hastily, before Trevize could answer, &quot;We will look forit, Fallom.&quot;And then Trevize said, &quot;It's settled then. On to Alpha.&quot;73&quot;Two big stars,&quot; said Fallom, pointing to the viewscreen.
<br>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Two of them. Bliss, do keep aneye on her. I don't want her fiddling with anything.&quot;<br>

&quot;She's fascinated by machinery,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;Yes, I know she is,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but I'm not fascinated by herfascination. Though to tell you the truth, I'm as fascinated asshe is at seeing two stars that bright in the viewscreen at the sametime.&quot;The two stars were bright enough to seem to be on the point of showinga disc each of them. The screen had automatically increasedfiltration density in order to remove the hard radiation and dim thelight of the bright stars so as to avoid retinal damage. As a result,few other stars were bright enough to be noticeable, and the two thatwere reigned in haughty near-isolation.
<br>&quot;The thing is,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;I've never been this close to a binarysystem before.&quot;<br>

&quot;You haven't?&quot; said Pelorat, open astonishment in his voice. &quot;How isthat possible?&quot;Trevize laughed. &quot;I've been around, Janov, but I'm not the Galacticrover you think I am.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I was never in space at all till I met you, Golan, butI always thought that anyone who did manage to get into space &quot;<br>

&quot;Would go everywhere. I know. That's natural enough. The troublewith planet-bound people is that no matter how much their mind may tellthem otherwise, their imaginations just can't take in the true size ofthe Galaxy. We could travel all our lives and leave most of the Galaxyunpenetrated and untouched. Besides, no one ever goes to binaries.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why not?&quot; said Bliss, frowning. &quot;We on Gaia know little astronomycompared to the traveling Isolates of the Galaxy, but I'm under theimpression that binaries aren't rare.&quot;<br>

&quot;They're not,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;There are substantially more binariesthan there are single stars. However, the formation of two stars in closeassociation upsets the ordinary processes of planetary formation. Binarieshave less planetary material than single stars do. Such planets as doform about them often have relatively unstable orbits and are very rarelyof a type that is reasonably habitable.
<br>&quot;Early explorers, I imagine, studied many binaries at close range but,after a while, for settlement purposes, they sought out only singles. And,of course, once you have a densely settled Galaxy, virtually all travelinvolves trade and communications and is carried on between inhabitedworlds circling single stars. In periods of military activity, I supposebases were sometimes set up on small, otherwise-uninhabited worldscircling one of the stars of a binary that happened to be strategicallyplaced, but as hyperspatial travel came to be perfected, such bases wereno longer necessary.&quot;Pelorat said humbly, &quot;It's amazing how much I don't know.&quot;Trevize merely grinned. &quot;Don't let that impress you, Janov. WhenI was in the Navy, we listened to an incredible number of lectures onoutmoded military tactics that no one ever planned, or intended to use,and were just talked about out of inertia. I was just rattling off a bitof one of them. Consider all you know about mythology, folklore,and archaic languages that I don't know, and that only you and a veryfew others do know.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Yes, but those two stars make up a binary system andone of them has an inhabited planet circling it.&quot;<br>

&quot;We hope it does, Bliss,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Everything has itsexceptions. And with an official question mark in this case, which makesit more puzzling. No, Fallom, those knobs are not toys. Bliss,either keep her in handcuffs, or take her out.&quot;<br>

&quot;She won't hurt anything,&quot; said Bliss defensively, but pulled theSolarian youngster to herself just the same. &quot;If you're so interestedin that habitable planet, why aren't we there already?&quot;<br>

&quot;For one thing,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;I'm just human enough to want tosee this sight of a binary system at close quarters. Then, too, I'mjust human enough to be cautious. As I've already explained, nothinghas happened since we left Gaia that would encourage me to be anythingbut cautious.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Which one of those stars is Alpha, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;We won't get lost, Janov. The computer knows exactly which one isAlpha, and, for that matter, so do we. It's the hotter and yellower ofthe two because it's the larger. Now the one on the right has a distinctorange tinge to its light, rather like Aurora's sun, if you recall. Doyou notice?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, now that you call it to my attention.&quot;<br>

&quot;Very well. That's the smaller one. What's the second letterof that ancient language you speak of?&quot;Pelorat thought a moment, and said, &quot;Beta.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then let's call the orange one Beta and the yellow-white one Alpha,and it's Alpha we're heading for right now.&quot;

   74&quot;Four planets,&quot; muttered Trevize. &quot;All are small,plus a trailing off of asteroids. No gas giants.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Do you find that disappointing?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not really. It's expected. Binaries that circle each other at smalldistances can have no planets circling one of the stars. Planets cancircle the center of gravity of both, but it's very unlikely that theywould be habitable too far away.
<br>&quot;On the other hand if the binaries are reasonably separate, there canbe planets in stable orbits about each, if they are close enough to oneor the other of the stars. These two stars, according to the computer'sdata bank, have an average separation of 3.5 billion kilometers and evenat periastron, when they are closest together, are about 1.7 billionkilometers apart. A planet in an orbit of less than 200 million kilometersfrom either star would be stably situated, but there can be no planetwith a larger orbit. That means no gas giants since they would haveto be farther away from a star, but what's the difference? Gas giantsaren't habitable, anyway.&quot;<br>

&quot;But one of those four planets might be habitable.&quot;<br>

&quot;Actually the second planet is the only real possibility. For onething, it's the only one of them large enough to have an atmosphere.&quot;They approached the second planet rapidly and over a period of two daysits image expanded; at first with a majestic and measured swelling. Andthen, when there was no sign of any ship emerging to intercept them,with increasing and almost frightening speed.
<br>The Far Star was moving swiftly along a temporary orbit athousand kilometers above the cloud cover, when Trevize said grimly,&quot;I see why the computer's memory banks put a question mark after thenotation that it was inhabited. There's no clear sign of radiation;either light in the night-hemisphere, or radio anywhere.&quot;<br>

&quot;The cloud cover seems pretty thick,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;That should not blank out radio radiation.&quot;They watched the planet wheeling below them, a symphony in swirlingwhite clouds, through occasional gaps of which a bluish wash indicatedocean.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;The cloud level is fairly heavy for an inhabitedworld. It might be a rather gloomy one. What bothers me most,&quot;he added, as they plunged once more into the night-shadow, &quot;is that nospace stations have hailed us.&quot;<br>

&quot;The way they did back at Comporellon, you mean?&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;The way they would in any inhabited world. We would have to stopfor the usual checkup on papers, freight, length of stay, and so on.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Perhaps we missed the hail for some reason.&quot;<br>

&quot;Our computer would have received it at any wavelength they mighthave cared to use. And we've been sending out our own signals, but haveroused no one and nothing as a result. Dipping under the cloud layerwithout communicating with station officials violates space courtesy,but I don't see that we have a choice.&quot;The Far Star slowed, and strengthened its antigravityaccordingly, so as to maintain its height. It came out into thesunlight again, and slowed further. Trevize, in co-ordination with thecomputer, found a sizable break in the clouds. The ship sank and passedthrough it. Beneath them heaved the ocean in what must have been a freshbreeze. It lay, wrinkled, several kilometers below, them, faintly stripedin lines of froth.
<br>They flew out of the sunlit patch and under the cloud cover. Theexpanse of water immediately beneath them turned a slate-gray, and thetemperature dropped noticeably.
<br>Fallom, staring at the viewscreen, spoke in her own consonant-richlanguage for a few moments, then shifted to Galactic. Her voicetrembled. &quot;What is that which I see beneath?&quot;<br>

&quot;That is an ocean,&quot; said Bliss soothingly. &quot;It is a very large massof water.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why does it not dry up?&quot;Bliss looked at Trevize, who said, &quot;There's too much water for it todry up.&quot;Fallom said in a half-choked manner, &quot;I don't want all that water. Letus go away.&quot; And then she shrieked, thinly, as the Far Star movedthrough a patch of storm clouds so that the viewscreen turned milky andwas streaked with the mark of raindrops.
<br>The lights in the pilot-room dimmed and the ship's motion becameslightly jerky.
<br>Trevize looked up in surprise and cried out. &quot;Bliss, your Fallom isold enough to transduce. She's using electric power to try to manipulatethe controls. Stop her!&quot;Bliss put her arms about Fallom, and hugged her tightly, &quot;It's allright, Fallom, it's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of. It'sjust another world, that's all. There are many like this.&quot;Fallom relaxed somewhat but continued to tremble.
<br>Bliss said to Trevize, &quot;The child has never seen an ocean, andperhaps, for all I know, never experienced fog or rain. Can't you besympathetic?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not if she tampers with the ship. She's a danger to all of us,then. Take her into your room and calm her down.&quot;Bliss nodded curtly.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;I'll come with you, Bliss.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, no, Pel,&quot; she responded. &quot;You stay here. I'll soothe Fallom andyou soothe Trevize.&quot; And she left.
<br>&quot;I don't need soothing,&quot; growled Trevize to Pelorat. &quot;I'm sorry if Iflew off the handle, but we can't have a child playing with the controls,can we?&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course we can't,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;but Bliss was caught bysurprise. She can control Fallom, who is really remarkably well behavedfor a child taken from her home and her her robot, and thrown,willy-nilly, into a life she doesn't understand.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know. It wasn't I who wanted to take her along, remember. It wasBliss's idea.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, but the child would have been killed, if we hadn't takenher.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, I'll apologize to Bliss later on. To the child, too.&quot;But he was still frowning, and Pelorat said gently, &quot;Golan, old chap,is there anything else bothering you?&quot;<br>

&quot;The ocean,&quot; said Trevize. They had long emerged from the rain storm,but the clouds persisted.
<br>&quot;What's wrong with it?&quot; asked Pelorat.
<br>&quot;There's too much of it, that's all.&quot;Pelorat looked blank, and Trevize said, with a snap, &quot;No land. Wehaven't seen any land. The atmosphere is perfectly normal, oxygen andnitrogen in decent proportions, so the planet has to be engineered,and there has to be plant life to maintain the oxygen level. In thenatural state, such atmospheres do not occur except, presumably,on Earth, where it developed, who knows how. But, then, on engineeredplanets there are always reasonable amounts of dry land, up to one thirdof the whole, and never less than a fifth. So how can this planet beengineered, and lack land?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Perhaps, since this planet is part of a binarysystem, it is completely atypical. Maybe it wasn't engineered, butevolved an atmosphere in ways that never prevail on planets about singlestars. Perhaps life developed independently here, as it once did on Earth,but only sea life.&quot;<br>

&quot;Even if we were to admit that,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;it would do us nogood. There's no way life in the sea can develop a technology. Technologyis always based on fire, and fire is impossible in the sea. A life-bearingplanet without technology is not what we're looking for.&quot;<br>

&quot;I realize that, but I'm only considering ideas. After all, as far aswe know, technology only developed once on Earth. Everywhere else,the Settlers brought it with them. You can't say technology is `always'
<br>anything, if you only have one case to study.&quot;<br>

&quot;Travel through the sea requires streamlining. Sea life cannot haveirregular outlines and appendages such as hands.&quot;<br>

&quot;Squids have tentacles.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I admit we are allowed to speculate, but if you'rethinking of intelligent squid-like creatures evolving independentlysomewhere in the Galaxy, and developing a technology not based on fire,you're supposing something not at all likely, in my opinion.&quot;<br>

&quot;In your opinion ,&quot; said Pelorat gently.
<br>Suddenly, Trevize laughed. &quot;Very well, Janov. I see you'relogic-chopping in order to get even with me for speaking harshly toBliss, and you're doing a good job. I promise you that if we find noland, we will examine the sea as best we can to see if we can find yourcivilized squids.&quot;As he spoke, the ship plunged into the night-shadow again, and theviewscreen turned black.
<br>Pelorat winced. &quot;I keep wondering,&quot; he said. &quot;Is this safe?&quot;<br>

&quot;Is what safe, Janov?&quot;<br>

&quot;Racing through the dark like this. We might dip, and dive into theocean, and be destroyed instantly.&quot;<br>

&quot;Quite impossible, Janov. Really! The computer keeps us travelingalong a gravitational line of force. In other words, it remains alwaysat a constant intensity of the planetary gravitational force which meansit keeps us at a nearly constant height above sea level.&quot;<br>

&quot;But how high?&quot;<br>

&quot;Nearly five kilometers.&quot;<br>

&quot;That doesn't really console me, Golan. Might we not reach land andsmash into a mountain we don't see?&quot;<br>

&quot; We don't see, but ship's radar will see it, and thecomputer will guide the ship around or over the mountain.&quot;<br>

&quot;What if there's level land, then? We'll miss it in the dark.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, Janov, we won't. Radar reflected from water is not at all likeradar reflected from land. Water is essentially flat; land is rough. Forthat reason, reflection from land is substantially more chaotic thanreflection from water. The computer will know the difference and it willlet me know if there's land in view. Even if it were day and the planetwere sun-lit, the computer might well detect land before I would.&quot;They fell silent and, in a couple of hours, they were back indaylight, with an empty ocean again rolling beneath them monotonously,but occasionally invisible when they passed through one of the numerousstorms. In one storm, the wind drove the Far Star out of itspath. The computer gave way, Trevize explained, in order to preventan unnecessary waste of energy and to minimize the chance of physicaldamage. Then, when the turbulence had passed, the computer eased theship back into its path.
<br>&quot;Probably the edge of a hurricane,&quot; said Trevize.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;See here, old chap, we're just traveling west toeast or east to west. All we're examining is the equator.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;That would be foolish, wouldn't it? We're followinga great-circle route northwest-southeast. That takes us through thetropics and both temperate zones and each time we repeat the circle, thepath moves westward, as the planet rotates on its axis beneath us. We'remethodically criss-crossing the world. By now, since we haven't hit land,the chances of a sizable continent are less than one in ten, accordingto the computer, and of a sizable island less than one in four, withthe chances going down each circle we make.&quot;<br>

&quot;You know what I would have done,&quot; said Pelorat slowly, as the nighthemisphere engulfed them again. &quot;I'd have stayed well away from theplanet and swept the entire hemisphere facing me with radar. The cloudswouldn't have mattered, would they?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And then zoom to the other side and do the samethere. Or just let the planet turn once. That's hindsight,Janov. Who would expect to approach a habitable planet without stoppingat a station and being given a path or being excluded? And if onewent under the cloud layer without stopping at a station, who would expectnot to find land almost at once? Habitable planets are land!&quot;<br>

&quot;Surely not all land,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;I'm not talking about that,&quot; said Trevize, in sudden excitement. &quot;I'msaying we've found land! Quiet!&quot;Then, with a restraint that did not succeed in hiding his excitement,Trevize placed his hands on the desk and became part of the computer. Hesaid, &quot;It's an island about two hundred and fifty kilometers long andsixty-five kilometers wide, more or less. Perhaps fifteen thousand squarekilometers in area or thereabout. Not large, but respectable. More thana dot on the map. Wait &quot;The lights in the pilot-room dimmed and went out.
<br>&quot;What are we doing?&quot; said Pelorat, automatically whispering as thoughdarkness were something fragile that must not be shattered.
<br>&quot;Waiting for our eyes to undergo dark-adaptation. The ship is hoveringover the island. Just watch. Do you see anything?&quot;<br>

&quot;No Little specks of light, maybe. I'm not sure.&quot;<br>

&quot;I see them, too. Now I'll throw in the telescopic lens.&quot;And there was light! Clearly visible. Irregular patches of it.
<br>&quot;It's inhabited,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It may be the only inhabited portionof the planet.&quot;<br>

&quot;What do we do?&quot;<br>

&quot;We wait for daytime. That gives us a few hours in which we canrest.&quot;<br>

&quot;Might they not attack us?&quot;<br>

&quot;With what? I detect almost no radiation except visible light andinfrared. It's inhabited and the inhabitants are clearly intelligent. Theyhave a technology, but obviously a preelectronic one, so I don't thinkthere's anything to worry about up here. If I should be wrong, thecomputer will warn me in plenty of time.&quot;<br>

&quot;And once daylight comes?&quot;<br>

&quot;We'll land, of course.&quot;75They came down when the first rays of the morning sunshone through a break in the clouds to reveal part of the island-freshlygreen, with its interior marked by a line of low, rolling hills stretchinginto the purplish distance.
<br>As they dropped closer, they could see isolated copses of treesand occasional orchards, but for the most part there weeeeeell-keptfarms. Immediately below them, on the southeastern shore of the islandwas a silvery beach backed by a broken line of boulders, and beyond itwas a stretch of lawn. They caught a glimpse of an occasional house,but these did not cluster into anything like a town.
<br>Eventually, they made out a dim network of roads, sparsely lined bydwelling places, and then, in the cool morning air, they spied an air-carin the far distance. They could only tell it was an air-car, and nota bird, by the manner of its maneuvering. It was the first indubitablesign of intelligent life in action they had yet seen on the planet.
<br>&quot;It could be an automated vehicle, if they could manage that withoutelectronics,&quot; said Trevize.
<br>Bliss said, &quot;It might well be. It seems to me that if there were ahuman being at the controls, it would be heading for us. We must be quitea sight a vehicle sinking downward without the use of braking jetsof rocket fire.&quot;<br>

&quot;A strange sight on any planet,&quot; said Trevize thoughtfully. &quot;Therecan't be many worlds that have ever witnessed the descent of a graviticspace-vessel. The beach would make a fine landing place, but ifthe winds blow I don't want the ship inundated. I'll make for the stretchof grass on the other side of the boulders.&quot;<br>

&quot;At least,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;a gravitic ship won't scorch privateproperty in descending.&quot;Down they came gently on the four broad pads that had moved slowlyoutward during the last stage. These pressed down into the soil underweight of the ship.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;I'm afraid we'll leave marks, though.&quot;<br>

&quot;At least,&quot; said Bliss, and there was that in her voice that was noten approving, &quot;the climate is evidently equable I would even say,warm.&quot;A human being was on the grass, watching the ship descend and showingno evidence of fear or surprise. The look on her face showed only raptinterest.
<br>She wore very little, which accounted for Bliss's estimate of theclimate. Her sandals seemed to be of canvas, and about her hips was awraparound skirt with a flowered pattern. There were no leg-coveringsand there was nothing above her waist.
<br>Her hair was black, long, and very glossy, descending almost to herwaist; Her skin color was a pale brown and her eyes were narrow.
<br>Trevize scanned the surroundings and there was no other human being insight. He shrugged and said, &quot;Well, it's early morning and the inhabitantsmay be mostly indoors, or even asleep. Still, I wouldn't say it was awell-populated area.&quot;He turned to the others and said, &quot;I'll go out and talk to the woman,if she, speaks anything comprehensible. The rest of you &quot;<br>

&quot;I should think,&quot; said Bliss firmly, &quot;that we might as well allstep out. That woman looks completely harmless and, in any case, I wantto stretch my legs and breathe planetary air, and perhaps arrange forplanetary food. I want Fallom to get the feel of a world again, too,and I think Pel would like to examine the woman at closer range.&quot;<br>

&quot;Who? I?&quot; said Pelorat, turning faintly pink. &quot;Not at all, Bliss,but I am the linguist of our little party.&quot;Trevize shrugged. &quot;Come one, come all. Still, though she may lookharmless, I intend to take my weapons with me.&quot;<br>

&quot;I doubt,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;that you will be much tempted to use them onthat young woman.&quot;Trevize grinned. &quot;She is attractive, isn't she?&quot;Trevize left the ship first, then Bliss, with one hand swung backwardto enclose Fallom's, who carefully made her way down the ramp afterBliss. Pelorat was last.
<br>The black-haired young woman continued to watch with interest. Shedid not back away an inch.
<br>Trevize muttered, &quot;Well, let's try.&quot;He held his arms away from his weapons and said, &quot;I greet you.&quot;The young woman considered that for a moment, and said, &quot;I greet theeand I greet thy companions.&quot;Pelorat said joyfully, &quot;How wonderful! She speaks Classical Galacticand with a correct accent.'&quot;<br>

&quot;I understand her, too,&quot; said Trevize, oscillating one hand to indicatehis understanding wasn't perfect. &quot;I hope she understands me.&quot;He said, smiling, and assuming a friendly expression, &quot;We come fromacross space. We come from another world.&quot;<br>

&quot;That is well,&quot; said the young woman, in her clear soprano. &quot;Comesthy ship from the Empire?&quot;<br>

&quot;It comes from a far star, and the ship is named Far Star .&quot;The young woman looked up at the lettering on the ship. &quot;Is thatwhat that sayeth? If that be so, and if the first letter is an F, then,behold, it is imprinted backward.&quot;Trevize was about to object, but Pelorat, in an ecstasy of joy, said,&quot;She's right. The letter F did reverse itself about two thousand yearsago. What a marvelous chance to study Classical Galactic in detail andas a living language.&quot;Trevize studied the young woman carefully. She was not much more than1.5 meters in height, and her breasts, though shapely, were small. Yetshe did not seem unripe. The nipples were large and the areolae dark,though that might be the result of her brownish skin color.
<br>He said, &quot;My name is Golan Trevize; my friend is Janov Pelorat;the woman is Bliss; and the child is Fallom.&quot;<br>

&quot;Is it the custom, then, on the far star from which you come, thatthe men be given a double name? I am Hiroko, daughter of Hiroko.&quot;<br>

&quot;And your father?&quot; interposed Pelorat suddenly.
<br>To which Hiroko replied with an indifferent shrug of her shoulder,&quot;His name, so sayeth my mother, is Smool, but it is of no importance. Iknow him not.&quot;<br>

&quot;And where are the others?&quot; asked Trevize. &quot;You seem to be the onlyone to be here to greet us.&quot;Hiroko said, &quot;Many men are aboard the fishboats; many women are in thefields. I take holiday these last two days and so am fortunate enough tosee this great thing. Yet people are curious and the ship will have beenseen as it descended, even from a distance. Others will be here soon.&quot;<br>

&quot;Are there many others on this island?&quot;<br>

&quot;There are more than a score and five thousand,&quot; said Hiroko withobvious pride.
<br>&quot;And are there other islands in the ocean?&quot;<br>

&quot;Other islands, good sir?&quot; She seemed puzzled.
<br>Trevize took that as answer enough. This was the one spot on theentire planet that was inhabited by human beings.
<br>He said, &quot;What do you call your world?&quot;<br>

&quot;It is Alpha, good sir. We are taught that the whole name is AlphaCentauri, if that has more meaning to thee, but we call it Alpha only and,see, it is a fair-visaged world.&quot;<br>

&quot;A what world?&quot; said Trevize, turning blankly toPelorat.
<br>&quot;A beautiful world, she means,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;That it is,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;at least here, and at this moment.&quot; Helooked up at the mild blue morning sky, with its occasional drift ofclouds. &quot;You have a nice sunny day, Hiroko, but I imagine there aren'tmany of those on Alpha.&quot;Hiroko stiffened. &quot;As many as we wish, sir. The clouds may come whenwe need rain, but on most days it seemeth good to us that the sky isfair above. Surely a goodly sky and a quiet wind are much to be desiredon those days when the fishboats are at sea.&quot;<br>

&quot;Do your people control the weather, then, Hiroko?&quot;<br>

&quot;Did we not, Sir Golan Trevize, we would be soggy with rain.&quot;<br>

&quot;But how do you do that?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not being a trained engineer, sir, I cannot tell thee.&quot;<br>

&quot;And what might be the name of this island on which you and yourpeople live?&quot; said Trevize, finding himself trapped in the ornatesound of Classical Galactic (and wondering desperately if he had theconjugations right).
<br>Hiroko said, &quot;We call our heavenly island in the midst of the vastsea of waters New Earth.&quot;At which Trevize and Pelorat stared at each other with surpriseand delight.
<br>76There was no time to follow up on the statement. Otherswere arriving. Dozens. They must consist of those, Trevize thought,who were not on the ships or in the fields, and who were not from toofar away. They came on foot for the most part, though two ground-carswere in evidence rather old and clumsy.
<br>Clearly, this was a low-technology society, and yet they controlledthe weather.
<br>It was well known that technology was not necessarily all of a piece;that lack of advance in some directions did not necessarily excludeconsiderable advance in others but surely this example of unevendevelopment was unusual.
<br>Of those who were now watching the ship, at least half were elderlymen and women; there were also three or four children. Of the rest, morewere women than men. None showed any fear or uncertainty whatever.
<br>Trevize said in a low voice to Bliss, &quot;Are you manipulating them? Theyseem serene.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm not in the least manipulating them,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;I never touchminds unless I must. It's Fallom I'm concerned with.&quot;Few as the newcomers were to anyone who had experienced the crowdsof curiosity-seekers on any normal world in the Galaxy, they were amob to Fallom, to whom the three adults on the Far Star hadbeen something to grow accustomed to. Fallom was breathing rapidly andshallowly, and her eyes were half-closed. Almost, she seemed in shock.
<br>Bliss was stroking her, softly and rhythmically, and making soothingsounds. Trevize was certain that she was delicately accompanying it allby an infinitely gentle rearrangement of mental fibrils.
<br>Fallom took in a sudden deep breath, almost a gasp, and shook herself,in what was perhaps an involuntary shudder. She raised her head andlooked at those present with something approaching normality and thenburied her head in the space between Bliss's arm and body.
<br>Bliss let her remain so, while her arm, encircling Fallom's shoulder,tightened periodically as though to indicate her own protective presenceover and over.
<br>Pelorat seemed rather awestruck, as his eyes went from one Alphan toanother. He said, &quot;Golan, they differ so among themselves.&quot;Trevize had noticed that, too. There were various shades of skinand hair color, including one brilliant redhead with blue eyes andfreckled skin. At least three apparent adults were as short as Hiroko,and one or two were taller than Trevize. A number of both sexes had eyesresembling those of Hiroko, and Trevize remembered that on the teemingcommercial planets of the Fili sector, such eyes were characteristic ofthe population, but he had never visited that sector.
<br>All the Alphans wore nothing above the waist and among the women thebreasts all seemed to be small. That was the most nearly uniform of allthe bodily characteristics that he could see.
<br>Bliss said suddenly, &quot;Miss Hiroko, my youngster is not accustomedto travel through space and she is absorbing more novelty than she caneasily manage. Would it be possible for her to sit down and, perhaps,have something to eat and drink?&quot;Hiroko looked puzzled, and Pelorat repeated what Bliss had said inthe more ornate Galactic of the mid-Imperial period.
<br>Hiroko's hand then flew to her mouth and she sank to her kneesgracefully. &quot;I crave your pardon, respected madam,&quot; she said. &quot;I havenot thought of this child's needs, nor of thine. The strangeness of thisevent has too occupied me. Wouldst thou would you all asvisitors and guests, enter the refectory for morning meal? May we joinyou and serve as hosts?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;That is kind of you.&quot; She spoke slowly and pronouncedthe words carefully, hoping to make them easier to understand. &quot;Itwould be better, though, if you alone served as hostess, for the sake ofthe comfort of the child who is unaccustomed to being with many peopleat once.&quot;Hiroko rose to her feet. &quot;It shall be as thou hast said.&quot;She led them, in leisurely manner, across the grass. Other Alphansedged closer. They seemed particularly interested in the clothing of thenewcomers. Trevize removed his light jacket, and handed it to a man whohad sidled toward him and had laid a questing finger upon it.
<br>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;look it over, but return it.&quot; Then he said toHiroko. &quot;See that I get it back, Miss Hiroko.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of a surety, it will be backhanded, respected sir.&quot; She nodded herhead gravely.
<br>Trevize smiled and walked on. He was more comfortable without thejacket in the light, mild breeze.
<br>He had detected no visible weapons on the persons of any of those abouthim, and he found it interesting that no one seemed to show any fear ordiscomfort over Trevize's. They did not even show curiosity concerningthem. It might well be that they were not aware of the objects as weaponsat all. From what Trevize had so far seen, Alpha might well be a worldutterly without violence.
<br>A woman, having moved rapidly forward, so as to be a little aheadof Bliss, turned to examine her blouse minutely, then said, &quot;Hast thoubreasts, respected madam?&quot;And, as though unable to wait for an answer, she placed her handlightly on Bliss's chest.
<br>Bliss smiled and said, &quot;As thou hast discovered, I have. They areperhaps not as shapely as thine, but I hide them not for that reason. Onmy world, it is not fitting that they be uncovered.&quot;She whispered in an aside to Pelorat, &quot;How do you like the way I'mgetting the hang of Classical Galactic?&quot;<br>

&quot;You did that very well, Bliss,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>The dining room was a large one with long tables to which wereattached long benches on either side. Clearly, the Alphans atecommunity-fashion.
<br>Trevize felt a pang of conscience. Bliss's request for privacy hadreserved this space for five people and forced the Alphans generallyto remain in exile outside. A number, however, placed themselves at arespectful distance from the windows (which were no more than gaps inthe wall, unfilled even by screens), presumably so that they might watchthe strangers eat.
<br>Involuntarily, he wondered what would happen if it were torain. Surely, the rain would come only when it was needed, light and mild,continuing without significant wind till enough had fallen. Moreover,it would always come at known times so that the Alphans would be readyfor it, Trevize imagined.
<br>The window he was facing looked out to sea, and far out at the horizonit seemed to Trevize that he could make out a bank of clouds similar tothose that so nearly filled the skies everywhere but over this littlespot of Eden.
<br>There were advantages to weather control.
<br>Eventually, they were served by a young woman on tiptoeing feet. Theywere not asked for their choice, but were merely served. There was a smallglass of milk, a larger of grape juice, a still larger of water. Eachdiner received two large poached eggs, with slivers of white cheeseon the side. Each also had a large platter of broiled fish and smallroasted potatoes, resting on cool, green lettuce leaves.
<br>Bliss looked with dismay at the quantity of food before her and wasclearly at a loss where to begin. Fallom had no such trouble. She drankthe grape juice thirstily and with clear evidence of approval, thenchewed away at the fish and potatoes. She was about to use her fingersfor the purpose, but Bliss held up a large spoon with tined ends thatcould serve as a fork as well, and Fallom accepted it.
<br>Pelorat smiled his satisfaction and cut into the eggs at once.
<br>Trevize, saying, &quot;Now to be reminded what real eggs taste like,&quot;followed suit.
<br>Hiroko, forgetting to eat her own breakfast in her delight at themanner in which the others ate (for even Bliss finally began, withobvious relish), said, at last, &quot;Is it well?&quot;<br>

&quot;It is well,&quot; said Trevize, his voice somewhat muffled. &quot;This islandhas no shortage of food, apparently. Or do you serve us more thanyou should, out of politeness?&quot;Hiroko listened with intent eyes, and seemed to grasp the meaning,for she said, &quot;No, no, respected sir. Our land is bountiful, our sea evenmore so. Our ducks give eggs, our goats both cheese and milk. And thereare our grains. Above all, our sea is filled with countless varietiesof fish in numberless quantity. The whole Empire could eat at our tablesand consume not the fish of our sea.&quot;Trevize smiled discreetly. Clearly, the young Alphan had not thesmallest idea of the true size of the Galaxy.
<br>He said, &quot;You call this island New Earth, Hiroko. Where, then, mightOld Earth be?&quot;She looked at him in bewilderment. &quot; Old Earth, say you? Icrave pardon, respected sir. I take not thy meaning.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Before there was a New Earth, your people must havelived elsewhere. Where was this elsewhere from which they came?&quot;<br>

&quot;I know naught of that, respected sir,&quot; she said, with troubledgravity. &quot;This land has been mine all my life, and my mother's andgrandmother's before me; and, I doubt not, their grandmother's andgreat-grandmother's before them. Of any other land, I know naught.&quot;<br>

&quot;But,&quot; said Trevize, descending to gentle argumentation, &quot;you speakof this land as New Earth. Why do you call it that?&quot;<br>

&quot;Because, respected sir,&quot; she replied, equally gentle, &quot;that is what itis called by all since the mind of woman goeth not to the contrary.&quot;<br>

&quot;But it is New Earth, and therefore, a later Earth. Theremust be an Old Earth, a former one, for which it wasnamed. Each morning there is a new day, and that implies that earlierthere had existed an old day. Don't you see that this must be so?&quot;<br>

&quot;Nay, respected sir. I know only what this land is called. I know ofnaught else, nor do I follow this reasoning of thine which sounds verymuch like what we call here chop-logic. I mean no offense.&quot;And Trevize shook his head and felt defeated.
<br>77Trevize leaned toward Pelorat, and whispered, &quot;Whereverwe go, whatever we do, we get no information.&quot;<br>

&quot;We know where Earth is, so what does it matter?&quot; said Pelorat,doing little more than move his lips.
<br>&quot;I want to know something about it.&quot;<br>

&quot;She's very young. Scarcely a repository of information.&quot;Trevize thought about that, then nodded. &quot;Right, Janov.&quot;He turned to Hiroko and said, &quot;Miss Hiroko, you haven't asked us whywe are here in your land?&quot;Hiroko's eyes fell, and she said, &quot;That would be but scant courtesyuntil you have all eaten and rested, respected sir.&quot;<br>

&quot;But we have eaten, or almost so, and we have recently rested, so Ishall tell you why we are here. My friend, Dr. Pelorat, is a scholaron our world, a learned man. He is a mythologist. Do you know whatthat means?&quot;<br>

&quot;Nay, respected sir, I do not.&quot;<br>

&quot;He studies old tales as they are told on different worlds. Old talesare known as myths or legends and they interest Dr. Pelorat. Are therelearned ones on New Earth who know the old tales of this world?&quot;Hiroko's forehead creased slightly into a frown of thought. She said,&quot;This is not a matter in which I am myself skilled. We have an old manin these parts who loves to talk of ancient days. Where he may havelearned these things, I know not, and methinks he may have spun hisnotions out of air, or heard them from others who did so spin. Thisis perhaps the material which thy learned companion would hear, yet Iwould not mislead thee. It is in my mind,&quot; she looked to right and leftas though unwilling to be overheard, &quot;that the old man is but a prater,though many listen willingly to him.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;Such prating is what we wish. Would it be possiblefor you to take my friend to this old man &quot;<br>

&quot;Monolee he calls himself.&quot;<br>

&quot; to Monolee, then. And do you think Monolee would be willingto speak to my friend?&quot;<br>

&quot;He? Willing to speak?&quot; said Hiroko scornfully. &quot;Thou must ask,rather, if he be ever ready to cease from speaking. He is but a man,and will therefore speak, if allowed, till a fortnight hence, with nopause. I mean no offense, respected sir.&quot;<br>

&quot;No offense taken. Would you lead my friend to Monolee now?&quot;<br>

&quot;That may anyone do at any time. The ancient is ever home and everready to greet an ear.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And perhaps an older woman would be willing to comeand sit with Madam Bliss. She has the child to care for and cannot moveabout too much. It would please her to have company, for women, as youknow, are fond of &quot;<br>

&quot;Prating?&quot; said Hiroko, clearly amused. &quot;Why, so men say, althoughI have observed that men are always the greater babblers. Let the menreturn from their fishing, and one will vie with another in tellinggreater flights of fancy concerning their catches. None will mark them norbelieve, but this will not stop them, either. But enough of my prating,too. I will have a friend of my mother's, one whom I can seethrough the window, stay with Madam Bliss and the child, and before thatshe will guide your friend, the respected doctor, to the aged Monolee. Ifyour friend will hear as avidly as Monolee will prate, thou wilt scarcelypart them in this life. Wilt thou pardon my absence a moment?&quot;When she had left, Trevize turned to Pelorat and said, &quot;Listen, getwhat you can out of the old man, and Bliss, you find out what you canfrom whoever stays with you. What you want is anything about Earth.&quot;<br>

&quot;And you?&quot; said Bliss. &quot;What will you do?&quot;<br>

&quot;I will remain with Hiroko, and try to find a third source.&quot;Bliss smiled. &quot;Ah yes. Pel will be with this old man; I with an oldwoman. You will force yourself to remain with this fetchingly uncladyoung woman. It seems a reasonable division of labor.&quot;<br>

&quot;As it happens, Bliss, it is reasonable.&quot;<br>

&quot;But you don't find it depressing that the reasonable division oflabor should work out so, I suppose.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, I don't. Why should I?&quot;<br>

&quot;Why should you, indeed?&quot;Hiroko was back, and sat down again. &quot;It is all arranged. The respectedDr. Pelorat will be taken to Monolee; and the respected Madam Bliss,together with her child, will have company. May I be granted, then,respected Sir Trevize, the boon of further conversation with thee,mayhap of this Old Earth of which thou &quot;<br>

&quot;Pratest?&quot; asked Trevize.
<br>&quot;Nay,&quot; said Hiroko, laughing. &quot;But thou dost well to mock me. I showedthee but discourtesy ere now in answering thy question on this matter. Iwould fain make amends.&quot;Trevize turned to Pelorat. &quot;Fain?&quot;<br>

&quot;Be eager,&quot; said Pelorat softly.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;Miss Hiroko, I felt no discourtesy, but if it willmake you feel better, I will gladly speak with you.&quot;<br>

&quot;Kindly spoken. I thank thee,&quot; said Hiroko, rising.
<br>Trevize rose, too. &quot;Bliss,&quot; he said, &quot;make sure Janov remainssafe.&quot;<br>

&quot;Leave that to me. As for you, you have your &quot; She nodded towardhis holsters.
<br>&quot;I don't think I'll need them,&quot; said Trevize uncomfortably.
<br>He followed Hiroko out of the dining room. The sun was higher in thesky now and the temperature was still warmer. There was an otherworldlysmell as always. Trevize remembered it had been faint on Comporellon, alittle musty on Aurora, and rather delightful on Solaria. (On Melpomenia,they were in space suits where one is only aware of the smell of one'sown body.) In every case, it disappeared in a matter of hours as theosmic centers of the nose grew saturated.
<br>Here, on Alpha, the odor was a pleasant grassy fragrance under thewarming effect of the sun, and Trevize felt a bit annoyed, knowing thatthis, too, would soon disappear.
<br>They were approaching a small structure that seemed to be built ofa pale pink plaster.
<br>&quot;This,&quot; said Hiroko, &quot;is my home. It used to belong to my mother'syounger sister.&quot;She walked in and motioned Trevize to follow. The door was open or,Trevize noticed as he passed through, it would be more accurate to saythere was no door.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;What do you do when it rains?&quot;<br>

&quot;We are ready. It will rain two days hence, for three hours eredawn, when it is coolest, and when it will moisten the soil mostpowerfully. Then I have but to draw this curtain, both heavy andwater-repellent, across the door.&quot;She did so as she spoke. It seemed made of a strong canvas-likematerial.
<br>&quot;I will leave it in place now,&quot; she went on. &quot;All will then knowI am within but not available, for I sleep or am occupied in mattersof importance.&quot;<br>

&quot;It doesn't seem much of a guardian of privacy.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why should it not be? See, the entrance is covered.&quot;<br>

&quot;But anyone could shove it aside.&quot;<br>

&quot;With disregard of the wishes of the occupant?&quot; Hiroko lookedshocked. &quot;Are such things done on thy world? It would be barbarous.&quot;Trevize grinned. &quot;I only asked.&quot;She led him into the second of two rooms, and, at her invitation, heseated himself in a padded chair. There was something claustrophobic aboutthe blockish smallness and emptiness of the rooms, but the house seemeddesigned for little more than seclusion and rest. The window openingswere small and near the ceiling, but there were dull mirror strips in acareful pattern along the walls, which reflected light diffusely. Therewere slits in the Ioor from which a gentle, cool breeze uplifted. Trevizesaw no signs of artifinal lighting and wondered if Alphans had to wakeat sunrise and go to bed at sunset.
<br>He was about to ask, but Hiroko spoke first, saying, &quot;Is Madam Blissthy woman companion?&quot;Trevize said cautiously, &quot;Do you mean by that, is she my sexualpartner?&quot;Hiroko colored. &quot;I pray thee, have regard for the decencies of politeconversation, but I do mean private pleasantry.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, she is the woman companion of my learned friend.&quot;<br>

&quot;But thou art the younger, and the more goodly.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, thank you for your opinion, but it is not Bliss's opinion. Shelikes Dr. Pelorat much more than she does me.&quot;<br>

&quot;That much surprises me. Will he not share?&quot;<br>

&quot;I have not asked him whether he would, but I'm sure he wouldn't. Norwould I want him to.&quot;Hiroko nodded her head wisely. &quot;I know. It is her fundament.&quot;<br>

&quot;Her fundament?&quot;<br>

&quot;Thou knowest. This.&quot; And she slapped her own dainty rear end.
<br>&quot;Oh, that! I understand you. Yes, Bliss is generously proportionedin her pelvic anatomy.&quot; He made a curving gesture with his hands andwinked. (And Hiroko laughed.)Trevize said, &quot;Nevertheless, a great many men enjoy that kind ofgenerosity of figure.&quot;<br>

&quot;I cannot believe so. Surely it would be a sort of gluttony to wishexcess of that which is pleasant in moderation. Wouldst thou think moreof me if my breasts were massive and dangling, with nipples pointingto toes? I have, in good sooth, seen such, yet have I not seen menflock to them. The poor women so afflicted must needs cover theirmonstrosities as Madam Bliss does.&quot;<br>

&quot;Such oversize wouldn't attract me, either, though I am sure thatBliss doesn't cover her breasts for any imperfection they may have.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thou dost not, then, disapprove of my visage or form?&quot;<br>

&quot;I would be a madman to do so. You are beautiful.&quot;<br>

&quot;And what dost thou for pleasantries on this ship of thine, as thouflittest from one world to the next Madam Bliss being deniedthee?&quot;<br>

&quot;Nothing, Hiroko. There's nothing to do. I think of pleasantries onoccasion and that has its discomforts, but we who travel through spaceknow well that there are times when we must do without. We make up forit at other times.&quot;<br>

&quot;If it be a discomfort, how may that be removed?&quot;<br>

&quot;I experience considerably more discomfort since you've brought upthe subject. I don't think it would be polite to suggest how I mightbe comforted.&quot;<br>

&quot;Would it be discourtesy, were I to suggest a way?&quot;<br>

&quot;It would depend entirely on the nature of the suggestion.&quot;<br>

&quot;I would suggest that we be pleasant with each other.&quot;<br>

&quot;Did you bring me here, Hiroko, that it might come to this?&quot;Hiroko said, with a pleased smile, &quot;Yes. It would be both myhostess-duty of courtesy, and it would be my wish, too.&quot;<br>

&quot;If that's the case, I will admit iiiis my wish, too. In fact,I would like very much to oblige you in this. I would be uhfain to do thee pleasure.&quot;

   78Lunch was in the same dining room in which they hadhad breakfast. It was full of Alphans, and with them were Trevize andPelorat, made thoroughly welcome. Bliss and Fallom ate separately,and more or less privately, in a small annex.
<br>There were several varieties of fish, together with soup in whichthere were strips of what might well have been boiled kid. Loaves ofbread were there for the slicing, butter and jam for the spreading. Asalad, large and diffuse, came afterward, and there was a notable absenceof any dessert, although fruit juices were passed about in apparentlyinexhaustible pitchers. Both Foundationers were forced to be abstemiousafter their heavy breakfast, but everyone else seemed to eat freely.
<br>&quot;How do they keep from getting fat?&quot; wondered Pelorat in a lowvoice.
<br>Trevize shrugged. &quot;Lots of physical labor, perhaps.&quot;It was clearly a society in which decorum at meals was not greatlyvalued. There was a miscellaneous hubbub of shouting, laughing, andthumping on the table with thick, obviously unbreakable, cups. Womenwere as loud and raucous as men, albeit in higher pitch.
<br>Pelorat winced, but Trevize, who now (temporarily, at least) felt notrace of the discomfort he had spoken of to Hiroko, felt both relaxedand good-natured.
<br>He said, &quot;Actually, it has its pleasant side. These are people whoappear to enjoy life and who have few, if any, cares. Weather is whatthey make it and foodiis unimaginably plentiful. This is a golden agefor them that simply continues and continues.&quot;He had to shout to make himself heard, and Pelorat shouted back,&quot;But it's so noisy.&quot;<br>

&quot;They're used to it.&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't see how they can understand each other in this riot.&quot;Certainly, it was all lost on the two Foundationers. The queerpronunciation and the archaic grammar and word order of the Alphanlanguage made it impossible to understand at the intense sound levels. Tothe Foundationers, it was like listening to the sounds of a zoo infright.
<br>It was not till after lunch that they rejoined Bliss in a smallstructure, which Trevize found to be rather inconsiderably differentfrom Hiroko's quarters, and which had been assigned them as their owntemporary living quarters. Fallom was in the second room, enormouslyrelieved to be alone, according to Bliss, and attempting to nap.
<br>Pelorat looked at the door-gap in the wall and said uncertainly,&quot;There's very little privacy here. How can we speak freely?&quot;<br>

&quot;I assure you,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;that once we pull the canvas barrieracross the door, we won't be disturbed. The canvas makes it impenetrableby all the force of social custom.&quot;Pelorat glanced at the high, open windows. &quot;We can be overheard.&quot;<br>

&quot;We need not shout. The Alphans won't eavesdrop. Even when they stoodoutside the windows of the dining room at breakfast, they remained ata respectful distance.&quot;Bliss smiled. &quot;You've learned so much about Alphan customs in thetime you spent alone with gentle little Hiroko, and you've gained suchconfidence in their respect for privacy. What happened?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;If you're aware that the tendrils of my mind haveundergone a change for the better and can guess the reason, I can onlyask you to leave my mind alone.&quot;<br>

&quot;You know very well that Gaia will not touch your mind under anycircumstances short of life-crisis, and you know why. Still, I'm notmentally blind. I could sense what happened a kilometer away. Is thisyour invariable custom on space voyages, my erotomaniac friend?&quot;<br>

&quot;Erotomaniac? Come, Bliss. Twice on this entire trip. Twice!&quot;<br>

&quot;We were only on two worlds that had functioning human females onthem. Two out of two, and we had only been a few hours on each.&quot;<br>

&quot;You are well aware I had no choice on Comporellon.&quot;<br>

&quot;That makes sense. I remember what she looked like.&quot; For a few moments,Bliss dissolved in laughter. Then she said, &quot;Yet I don't think Hirokoheld you helpless in her mighty grip, or inflicted her irresistible willon your cringing body.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course not. I was perfectly willing. But it was her suggestion,just the same.&quot;Pelorat said, with just a tinge of envy in his voice, &quot;Does thishappen to you all the time, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course it must, Pel,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Women are helplessly drawnto him.&quot;<br>

&quot;I wish that were so,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but it isn't. And I'm glad itisn't I do have other things I want to do in life. Just the same,in this case I was irresistible. After all, we were the first peoplefrom another world that Hiroko had ever seen or, apparently, that anyonenow alive on Alpha had ever seen: I gathered from things she let slip,casual remarks, that she had the rather exciting notion that I mightbe different from Alphans, either anatomically or in my technique. Poorthing. I'm afraid she was disappointed.&quot;<br>

&quot;Oh?&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Were you?&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I have been on a number of worlds and I have hadmy experiences. And what I had discovered is that people are people andsex is sex, wherever one goes. If there are noticeable differences, theyare usually both trivial and unpleasant. The perfumes I've encountered inmy time! I remember when a young woman simply couldn't manage unless therewas music loudly played, music that consisted of a desperate screechingsound. So she played the music and then I couldn't manage. Iassure you if it's the same old thing, then I'm satisfied.&quot;<br>

&quot;Speaking of music,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;we are invited to a musicale afterdinner. A very formal thing, apparently, that is being held in ourhonor. I gather the Alphans are very proud of their music.&quot;Trevize grimaced. &quot;Their pride will in no way make the music soundbetter to our ears.&quot;<br>

&quot;Hear me out,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;I gather that their pride is that theyplay expertly on very archaic instruments. Very archaic. Wemay get some information about Earth by way of them.&quot;Trevize's eyebrows shot up. &quot;An interesting thought. And that remindsme that both of you may already have information. Janov, did you seethis Monolee that Hiroko told us about?&quot;<br>

&quot;Indeed I did,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;I was with him for three hours andHiroko did not exaggerate. It was a virtual monologue on his part andwhen I left to come to lunch, he clung to me and would not let me gountil I promised to return whenever I could in order that I might listento him some more.&quot;<br>

&quot;And did he say anything of interest?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, he, too like everybody else insisted that Earthwas thoroughly and murderously radioactive; that the ancestors of theAlphans were the last to leave and that if they hadn't, they would havedied. And, Golan, he was so emphatic that I couldn't help believinghim. I'm convinced that Earth is dead, and that our entire search is,after all, useless.&quot;79Trevize sat back in his chair, staring at Pelorat,who was sitting on a narrow cot. Bliss, having risen from where she hadbeen sitting next to Pelorat, looked from one to the other.
<br>Finally, Trevize said, &quot;Let me be the judge as to whether our searchis useless or not, Janov. Tell me what the garrulous old man had to sayto you in brief, of course.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I took notes as Monolee spoke. It helped reinforcemy role a scholar, but I don't have to refer to them. He was quitestream-of-consciousness in his speaking. Each thing he said would remindhim of something else, but, of course, I have spent my life trying toorganize information in the search of the relevant and significant,so that it's second nature for me now to be able to condense a long andincoherent discourse &quot;Trevize said gently, &quot;Into something just as long and incoherent? Tothe point, dear Janov.&quot;Pelorat cleared his throat uneasily. &quot;Yes, certainly, old chap. I'lltry to make a connected and chronological tale out of it. Earth wasthe original home of humanity and of millions of species of plants andanimals. It continued so for countless years until hyperspatial travelwas invented. Then the Spacer worlds were founded. They broke away fromEarth, developed their own cultures, and came to despise and oppressthe mother planet.
<br>&quot;After a couple of centuries of this, Earth managed to regain itsfreedom, though Monolee did not explain the exact manner in which thiswas done, and I dared not ask questions, even if he had given me achance to interrupt, which he did not, for that might merely have senthim into new byways. He did mention a culture-hero named Elijah Baley,but the references were so characteristic of the habit of attributingto one figure the accomplishments of generations that there was littlevalue in attempting to &quot;Bliss said, &quot;Yes, Pel dear, we understand that part.&quot;Again, Pelorat paused in midstream and reconsidered. &quot;Of course. Myapologies. Earth initiated a second wave of settlements, founding many newworlds in a new fashion. The new group of Settlers proved more vigorousthan the Spacers, outpaced them, defeated them, outlasted them, and,eventually, established the Galactic Empire. During the course of thewars between the Settlers and the Spacers no, not wars, for heused the word `conflict,' being very careful about that the Earthbecame radioactive.&quot;Trevize said, with clear annoyance, &quot;That's ridiculous, Janov. How cana world become radioactive? Every world is very slightlyradioactive to one degree or another from the moment of formation,and that radioactivity slowly decays. It doesn't become radioactive.&quot;Pelorat shrugged. &quot;I'm only telling you what he said. And he wasonly telling me what he had heard from someone who only told himwhat he had heard and so on. It's folk-history, told and retoldover the generations, with who knows what distortions creeping in ateach retelling.&quot;<br>

&quot;I understand that, but are there no books, documents, ancienthistories which have frozen the story at an early time and which couldgive us something more accurate than the present tale?&quot;<br>

&quot;Actually, I managed to ask that question, and the answer is no. Hesaid vaguely that there were books about it in ancient times and thatthey had long ago been lost, but that what he was telling us was whathad been in those books.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, well distorted. It's the same story. In every world we go to,the records of Earth have, in one way or another, disappeared. Well,how did he say the radioactivity began on Earth?&quot;<br>

&quot;He didn't, in any detail. The closest he came to saying so wasthat the Spacers were responsible, but then I gathered that the Spacerswere the demons on whom the people of Earth blamed all misfortune. Theradioactivity &quot;A clear voice overrode him here. &quot;Bliss, am I a Spacer?&quot;Fallom was standing in the narrow doorway between the two rooms, hairtousled and the nightgown she was wearing (designed to fit Bliss's moreample proportions) having slid off one shoulder to reveal an undevelopedbreast.
<br>Bliss said, &quot;We worry about eavesdroppers outside and we forget theone inside. Now, Fallom, why do you say that?&quot; She rose and walkedtoward the youngster.
<br>Fallom said, &quot;I don't have what they have,&quot; she pointed at thetwo men, &quot;or what you have, Bliss. I'm different. Is that because I'ma Spacer?&quot;<br>

&quot;You are, Fallom,&quot; said Bliss soothingly, &quot;but little differencesdon't matter. Come back to bed.&quot;Fallom became submissive as she always did when Bliss willed her tobe so. She turned and said, &quot;Am I a demon? What is a demon?&quot;Bliss said over her shoulder, &quot;Wait one moment for me. I'll be rightback.&quot;She was, within five minutes. She was shaking her head. &quot;She'll besleeping now till I wake her. I should have done that before, I suppose,but any modification of the mind must be the result of necessity.&quot; Sheadded defensively, &quot;I can't have her brood on the differences betweenher genital equipment and ours.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Someday she'll have to know she's hermaphroditic.&quot;<br>

&quot;Someday,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;but not now. Go on with the story, Pel.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;before something else interrupts us.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, Earth became radioactive, or at least its crust did. At thattime, Earth had had an enormous population that was centered in hugecities that existed for the most part underground &quot;<br>

&quot;Now, that,&quot; put in Trevize, &quot;is surely not so. It must be localpatriotism glorifying the golden age of a planet, and the details weresimply a distortion of Trantor in its golden age, when itwas the Imperial capital of a Galaxy-wide system of worlds.&quot;Pelorat paused, then said, &quot;Really, Golan, you mustn't teach memy business. We mythologists know very well that myths and legendscontain borrowings, moral lessons, nature cycles, and a hundred otherdistorting influences, and we labor to cut them away and get to whatmight be a kernel of truth. In fact, these same techniques must beapplied to the most sober histories, for no one writes the clear andapparent truth if such a thing can even be said to exist. For now,I'm telling you more or less what Monolee told me, though I suppose Iam adding distortions of my own, try as I might not to do so.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Go on, Janov. I meant no offense.&quot;<br>

&quot;And I've taken none. The huge cities, assuming they existed, crumbledand shrank as the radioactivity slowly grew more intense until thepopulation was but a remnant of what it had been, clinging precariously toregions that were relatively radiation-free. The population was kept downby rigid birth control and by the euthanasia of people over sixty.&quot;<br>

&quot;Horrible,&quot; said Bliss indignantly.
<br>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;but that is what they did, according toMonolee, and that might be true, for it is certainly not complimentary tothe Earthpeople and it is not likely that an uncomplimentary lie wouldbe made up. The Earthpeople, having been despised and oppressed by theSpacers, were now despised and oppressed by the Empire, though here wemay have exaggeration there out of self-pity, which is a very seductiveemotion. There is the case &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, yes, Pelorat, another time. Please go on with Earth.&quot;<br>

&quot;I beg your pardon. The Empire, in a fit of benevolence, agreed tosubstitute imported radiation-free soil and to cart away the contaminatedsoil. Needless to say, that was an enormous task which the Empire soontired of, especially as this period (if my guess is right) coincidedwith the fall of Kandar V, after which the Empire had many more thingsto worry about than Earth.
<br>&quot;The radioactivity continued to grow more intense, the populationcontinued to fall, and finally the Empire, in another fit of benevolence,offered to transplant the remnant of the population to a new world oftheir own to this world, in short.
<br>&quot;At an earlier period, it seems an expedition had stocked the ocean sothat by the time the plans for the transplantation of Earthpeople werebeing developed, there was a full oxygen atmosphere and an ample supplyof food on Alpha. Nor did any of the worlds of the Galactic Empire covetthis world because there is a certain natural antipathy to planets thatcircle stars of a binary system. There are so few suitable planets insuch a system, I suppose, that even suitable ones are rejected becauseof the assumption that there must be something wrong with them. This isa common thought-fashion. There is the well-known case, for instance,of &quot;<br>

&quot;Later with the well-known case, Janov,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;On with thetransplantation.&quot;<br>

&quot;What remained,&quot; said Pelorat, hurrying his words a little, &quot;wasto prepare a land-base. The shallowest part of the ocean was found andsediment was raised from deeper parts to add to the shallow sea-bottomand, finally, to produce the island of New Earth. Boulders and coralwere dredged up and added to the island. Land plants were seeded so thatroot systems might help make the new land firm. Again, the Empire hadset itself an enormous task. Perhaps continents were planned at first,but by the time this one island was produced, the Empire's moment ofbenevolence had passed.
<br>&quot;What was left of Earth's population was brought here. The Empire'sfleets carried off its men and machinery, and they never returned. TheEarthpeople, living on New Earth, found themselves in completeisolation.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Complete? Did Monolee say that no one from elsewherein the Galaxy has ever come here till we did?&quot;<br>

&quot;Almost complete,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;There is nothing to come here for,I suppose, even if we set aside the superstitious distaste for binarysystems. Occasionally, at long intervals, a ship would come, as ours did,but it would eventually leave and there has never been a follow-up. Andthat's it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Did you ask Monolee where Earth was located?&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course I asked that. He didn't know.&quot;<br>

&quot;How can he know so much about Earth's history without knowing whereit is located?&quot;<br>

&quot;I asked him specifically, Golan, if the star that was only aparsec or so distant from Alpha might be the sun about which Earthrevolved. He didn't know what a parsec was, and I said it was a shortdistance, astronomically speaking. He said, short or long, he did notknow where Earth was located and he didn't know anyone who knew, and,in his opinion, it was wrong to try to find it. It should be allowed,he said, to move endlessly through space in peace.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Do you agree with him?&quot;Pelorat shook his head sorrowfully. &quot;Not really. But he said thatat the rate the radioactivity continued to increase, the planet musthave become totally uninhabitable not long after the transplantationtook place and that by now it must be burning intensely so that no onecan approach.&quot;<br>

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Trevize firmly. &quot;A planet cannot become radioactiveand, having done so, continuously increase in radioactivity. Radioactivitycan only decrease.&quot;<br>

&quot;But Monolee is so sure of it. So many people we've talked to onvarious worlds unite in this that Earth is radioactive. Surely,it is useless to go on.&quot;80Trevize drew a deep breath, then said, in a carefullycontrolled voice, &quot;Nonsense, Janov. That's not true.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Well, now, old chap, you mustn't believe somethingjust because you want to believe it.&quot;<br>

&quot;My wants have nothing to do with it. In world after world we findall records of Earth wiped out. Why should they be. wiped out if thereis nothing to hide; if Earth is a dead, radioactive world that cannotbe approached?&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know, Golan.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, you do. When we were approaching Melpomenia, you said that theradioactivity might be the other side of the coin. Destroy records toremove accurate information; supply the tale of radioactivity to insertinaccurate information. Both would discourage any attempt to find Earth,and we mustn't be deluded into discouragement.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Actually, you seem to think the nearby star is Earth'ssun. Why, then, continue to argue the question of radioactivity? Whatdoes it matter? Why not simply go to the nearby star and see if it isEarth, and, if so, what it is like?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Because those on Earth must be, in their way,extraordinarily powerful, and I would prefer to approach with someknowledge of the world and its inhabitants. As it is, since I continue toremain ignorant of Earth, approaching it is dangerous. It is my notionthat I leave the rest of you here on Alpha and that I proceed to Earthby myself. One life is quite enough to risk.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, Golan,&quot; said Pelorat earnestly. &quot;Bliss and the child might waithere, but I must go with you. I have been searching for Earth sincebefore you were born and I cannot stay behind when the goal is so close,whatever dangers might threaten.&quot;<br>

&quot;Bliss and the child will not wait here,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Iam Gaia, and Gaia can protect us even against Earth.&quot;<br>

&quot;I hope you're right,&quot; said Trevize gloomily, &quot;but Gaia could notprevent the elimination of all early memories of Earth's role in itsfounding.&quot;<br>

&quot;That was done in Gaia's early history when it was not yet wellorganized, not yet advanced. Matters are different now.&quot;<br>

&quot;I hope that is so. Or is it that you have gained informationabout Earth this morning that we don't have? I did ask that you speakto some of the older women that might be available here.&quot;<br>

&quot;And so I did.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And what did you find out?&quot;<br>

&quot;Nothing about Earth. There is a total blank there.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah.&quot;<br>

&quot;But they are advanced biotechnologists.&quot; ,&quot;Oh?&quot;<br>

&quot;On this small island, they have grown and tested innumerable strainsof plants and animals and designed a suitable ecological balance, stableand self-supporting, despite the few species with which they began. Theyhave improved on the ocean life that they found when they arrived here afew thousand years ago, increasing their nutritive value and improvingtheir taste. It is their biotechnology that has made this world such acornucopia of plenty. They have plans for themselves, too.&quot;<br>

&quot;What kind of plans?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;They know perfectly well they cannot reasonably expect toexpand their range under present circumstances, confined as they are tothe one small patch of land that exists on their world, but they dreamof becoming amphibious.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of becoming what ?&quot;<br>

&quot;Amphibious. They plan to develop gills in addition to lungs. Theydream of being able to spend substantial periods of time underwater; offinding shallow regions and building structures on the ocean bottom. Myinformant was quite glowing about it but she admitted that this had beena goal of the Alphans for some centuries now and that little, if any,progress has been made.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;That's two fields in which they might be more advancedthan we are; weather control and biotechnology. I wonder what theirtechniques are.&quot;<br>

&quot;We'd have to find specialists,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;and they might not bewilling to talk about it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It's not our primary concern here,but it would clearly pay the Foundation to attempt to learn from thisminiature world.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;We manage to control the weather fairly well onTerminus, as it is.&quot;<br>

&quot;Control is good on many worlds,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but always it's amatter of the world as a whole. Here the Alphans control the weatherof a small portion of the world and they must have techniques we don'thave. Anything else, Bliss?&quot;<br>

&quot;Social invitations. These appear to be a holiday-making people,in whatever time they can take from farming and fishing. Afterdinner, tonight there'll be a music festival. I told you aboutthat already. Tomorrow, during the day, there will be a beachfestival. Apparently, all around the rim of the island there will bea congregation of everyone who can get away from the fields in orderthat they might enjoy the water and celebrate the sun, since it will beraining the next day. In the morning, the fishing fleet will come back,beating the rain, and by evening there will be a food festival, samplingthe catch.&quot;Pelorat groaned. &quot;The meals are ample enough as it is. What would afood festival be like?&quot;<br>

&quot;I gather that it will feature not quantity, but variety. In anycase, all four of us are invited to participate in all the festivals,especially the music festival tonight.&quot;<br>

&quot;On the antique instruments?&quot; asked Trevize.
<br>&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>

&quot;What makes them antique, by the way? Primitive computers?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, no. That's the point. It isn't electronic music at all, butmechanical. They described it to me. They scrape strings, blow in tubes,and bang on surfaces.&quot;<br>

&quot;I hope you're making that up,&quot; said Trevize, appalled.
<br>&quot;No, I'm not. And I understand that your Hiroko will be blowing onone of the tubes I forget its name and you ought to be ableto endure that.&quot;<br>

&quot;As for myself,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;I would love to go. I know very littleabout primitive music and I would like to hear it.&quot;<br>

&quot;She is not `my Hiroko,'&quot; said Trevize coldly. &quot;But are the instrumentsof the type once used on Earth, do you suppose?&quot;<br>

&quot;So I gathered,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;At least the Alphan women said theywere designed long before their ancestors came here.&quot;<br>

&quot;In that case,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;it may be worth listening to allthat scraping, tootling, and banging, for whatever information it mightconceivably yield concerning Earth.&quot;81Oddly enough, it was Fallom who was most excited atthe prospect of a musical evening. She and Bliss had bathed in thesmall outhouse behind their quarters. It had a bath with running water,hot and cold (or, rather, warm and cool), a washbowl, and a commode. Itwas totally clean and usable and, in the late afternoon sun, it was evenwell lit and cheerful.
<br>As always, Fallom was fascinated with Bliss's breasts and Bliss wasreduced to saying (now that Fallom understood Galactic) that on herworld that was the way people were. To which Fallom said, inevitably,&quot;Why?&quot; and Bliss, after some thought, deciding there was no sensibleway of answering, returned the universal reply, &quot;Because!&quot;When they were done, Bliss helped Fallom put on the undergarmentsupplied them by the Alphans and worked out the system whereby theskirt went on over it. Leaving Fallom unclothed from the waist up seemedreasonable enough. She herself, while making use of Alphan garments belowthe waist (rather tight about the hips), put on her own blouse. It seemedsilly to be too inhibited to expose breasts in a society where all womendid, especially since her own were not large and were as shapely as anyshe had seen but there it was.
<br>The two men took their turn at the outhouse next, Trevize mutteringthe usual male complaint concerning the time the women had taken.
<br>Bliss turned Fallom about to make sure the skirt would hold in placeover her boyish hips and buttocks. She said, &quot;It's a very pretty skirt,Fallom. Do you like it?&quot;Fallom stared at it in a mirror and said, &quot;Yes, I do. Won't I be coldwith nothing on, though?&quot; and she ran her hands down her bare chest.
<br>&quot;I don't think so, Fallom. It's quite warm on this world.&quot;<br>

&quot; You have something on.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, I do. That's how it is on my world. Now, Fallom, we're going tobe with a great many Alphans during dinner and afterward. Do you thinkyou can bear that?&quot;Fallom looked distressed, and Bliss went on, &quot;I will sit on your rightside and I will hold you. Pel will sit on the other side, and Trevizewill sit across the table from you. We won't let anyone talk to you,and you won't have to talk to anyone.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'll try, Bliss,&quot; Fallom piped in her highest tones.
<br>&quot;Then afterward,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;some Alphans will make music for usin their own special way. Do you know what music is?&quot; She hummed in thebest imitation of electronic harmony that she could.
<br>Fallom's face lit up. &quot;You mean&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; The last word was inher own language, and she burst into song.
<br>Bliss's eyes widened. It was a beautiful tune, even though it was wild,and rich in trills. &quot;That's right. Music,&quot; she said.
<br>Fallom said excitedly, &quot;Jemby made&quot; she hesitated, then decidedto use the Galactic word &quot;music all the time. It made music on a&nbsp; &quot; Again a word in her own language.
<br>Bliss repeated the word doubtfully, &quot;On a feeful?&quot;Fallom laughed. &quot;Not feeful,&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With both words juxtaposed like that, Bliss could hear the difference,but she despaired of reproducing the second. She said, &quot;What does itlook like?&quot;Fallom's as yet limited vocabulary in Galactic did not suffice for anaccurate description, and her gestures did not produce any shape clearlyin Bliss's mind.
<br>&quot;He showed me how to use the&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; Fallom said proudly. &quot;Iused my fingers just the way Jemby did, but it said that soon I wouldn'thave to.&quot;<br>

&quot;That's wonderful, dear,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;After dinner, we'll see ifthe Alphans are as good as your Jemby was.&quot;Fallom's eyes sparkled and pleasant thoughts of what was to followcarried her through a lavish dinner despite the crowds and laughterand noise all about her. Only once, when a dish was accidentally upset,setting off shrieks of excitement fairly close to them, did Fallom lookfrightened, and Bliss promptly held her close in a warm and protectivehug.
<br>&quot;I wonder if we can arrange to eat by ourselves,&quot; she muttered toPelorat. &quot;Otherwise, we'll have to get off this world. It's bad enougheating all this Isolate animal protein, but I must be ableto do it in peace.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's only high spirits,&quot; said Pelorat, who would have endured anythingwithin reason that he felt came under the heading of primitive behaviorand beliefs.
<br>&nbsp;And then the dinner was over, and the announcement came thatthe music festival would soon begin.
<br>82The hall in which the music festival was to be heldwas about as large as the dining room, and there were folding seats(rather uncomfortable, Trevize found out) for about a hundred fiftypeople. As honored guests, the visitors were led to the front row,and various Alphans commented politely and favorably on their clothes.
<br>Both men were bare above the waist and Trevize tightened his abdominalmuscles whenever he thought of it and stared down, on occasion, withcomplacent self-admiration at his dark-haired chest. Pelorat, in hisardent observation of everything about him, was indifferent to his ownappearance. Bliss's blouse drew covert stares of puzzlement but nothingwas said concerning it.
<br>Trevize noted that the hall was only about half-full and that thelarge majority of the audience were women, since, presumably, so manymen were out to sea.
<br>Pelorat nudged Trevize and whispered, &quot;They have electricity.&quot;Trevize looked at the vertical tubes on the walls, and at others onthe ceiling. They were softly luminous.
<br>&quot;Fluorescence,&quot; he said. &quot;Quite primitive.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, but they do the job, and we've got those things in our roomsand in the outhouse. I thought they were just decorative. If we can findout how to work them, we won't have to stay in the dark.&quot;Bliss said irritably, &quot;They might have told us.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;They thought we'd know; that anyone would know.&quot;Four women now emerged from behind screens and seated themselves ina group in the space at the front. Each held an instrument of varnishedwood of a similar shape, but one that was not easily describable. Theinstruments were chiefly different in size. One was quite small, twosomewhat larger, and the fourth considerably larger. Each woman alsoheld a long rod in the other hand.
<br>The audience whistled softly as they came in, in response to whichthe four women bowed. Each had a strip of gauze bound fairly tightlyacross the breasts as though to keep them from interfering with theinstrument.
<br>Trevize, interpreting the whistles as signs of approval, or of pleasedanticipation, felt it only polite to add his own. At that, Fallom added atrill that was far more than a whistle and that was beginning to attractattention when pressure from Bliss's hand stopped her.
<br>Three of the women, without preparation, put their instruments undertheir chins, while the largest of the instruments remained between thelegs of the fourth woman and rested on the floor. The long rod in theright hand of each was sawed across the strings stretching nearly thelength of the instrument, while the fingers of the left hand shiftedrapidly along the upper ends of those strings.
<br>This, thought Trevize, was the &quot;scraping&quot; he had expected, butit didn't sound like scraping at all. There was a soft and melodioussuccession of notes; each instrument doing something of its own and thewhole fusing pleasantly.
<br>It lacked the infinite complexity of electronic music (&quot;real music,&quot; asTrevize could not help but think of it) and there was a distinct samenessto it. Still, as time passed, and his ear grew accustomed to this oddsystem of sound, he began to pick out subtleties. It was wearisome tohave to do so, and he thought, longingly, of the clamor and mathematicalprecision and purity of the real thing, but it occurred to him that ifhe listened to the music of these simple wooden devices long enough hemight well grow to like it.
<br>It was not till the concert was some forty-five minutes old that Hirokostepped out. She noticed Trevize in the front row at once and smiled athim. He joined the audience in the soft whistle of approval with a wholeheart. She looked beautiful in a long and most elaborate skirt, a largeflower in her hair, and nothing at all over her breasts since (apparently)there was no danger of their interference with the instrument.
<br>Her instrument proved to be a dark wooden tube about two thirds of ameter long and nearly two centimeters thick. She lifted the instrumentto her lips and blew across an opening near one end, producing a thin,sweet note that wavered in pitch as her fingers manipulated metal objectsalong the length of the tube.
<br>At the first sound, Fallom clutched at Bliss's arm and said, &quot;Bliss,that's a&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; and the word sounded like &quot;feeful&quot; to Bliss.
<br>Bliss shook her head firmly at Fallom, who said, in a lower voice,&quot;But it is!&quot;Others were looking in Fallom's direction. Bliss put her hand firmlyover Fallom's mouth, and leaned down to mutter an almost subliminallyforceful &quot;Quiet!&quot; into her ear.
<br>Fallom listened to Hiroko's playing quietly thereafter, but herfingers moved spasmodically, as though they were operating the objectsalong the length of the instrument.
<br>The final player in the concert was an elderly man who had aninstrument with fluted sides suspended over his shoulders. He pulled itin and out while one hand flashed across a succession of white and darkobjects at one end, pressing them down in groups.
<br>Trevize found this sound particularly wearing, rather barbaric,and unpleasantly like the memory of the barking of the dogs onAurora not that the sound was like barking, but the emotions it gaverise to were similar. Bliss looked as though she would like to place herhands over her ears, and Pelorat had a frown on his face. Only Fallomseemed to enjoy it, for she was tapping her foot lightly, and Trevize,when he noticed that, realized, to his own surprise, that there was abeat to the music that matched Fallom's footfall.
<br>It came to an end at last and there was a perfect storm of whistling,with Fallom's trill clearly heard above it all.
<br>Then the audience broke up into small conversational groups and becameas loud and raucous as Alphans seemed to be on all public occasions. Thevarious individuals who had played in the concert stood about in front ofthe room and spoke to those people who came up to congratulate them.
<br>Fallom evaded Bliss's grasp and ran up to Hiroko.
<br>&quot;Hiroko,&quot; she cried out, gaspingly. &quot;Let me see the&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<br>

&quot;The what, dear one?&quot; said Hiroko.
<br>&quot;The thing you made the music with.&quot;<br>

&quot;Oh.&quot; Hiroko laughed. &quot;That's a flute, little one.&quot;<br>

&quot;May I see it?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well.&quot; Hiroko opened a case and took out the instrument. It was inthree parts, but she put it together quickly, held it toward Fallom withthe mouthpiece near her lips, and said, &quot;There, blow thou thy breathacross this.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know. I know,&quot; said Fallom eagerly, and reached for the flute.
<br>Automatically, Hiroko snatched it away and held it high. &quot;Blow, child,but touch not.&quot;Fallom seemed disappointed. &quot;May I just look at it, then? I won'ttouch it.&quot;<br>

&quot;Certainly, dear one.&quot;She held out the flute again and Fallom stared at it earnestly.
<br>And then, the fluorescent lighting in the room dimmed very slightly,and the sound of a flute's note, a little uncertain and wavering, madeitself heard.
<br>Hiroko, in surprise, nearly dropped the flute, and Fallom cried out,&quot;I did it. I did it. Jemby said someday I could do it.&quot;Hiroko said, &quot;Was it thou that made the sound?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, I did. I did.&quot;<br>

&quot;But how didst thou do so, child?&quot;Bliss said, red with embarrassment, &quot;I'm sorry, Hiroko. I'll takeher away.&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Hiroko. &quot;I wish her to do it again.&quot;A few of the nearest Alphans had gathered to watch. Fallom furrowedher brow as though trying hard. The fluorescents dimmed rather more thanbefore, and again there was the note of the flute, this time pure andsteady. Then it became erratic as the metal objects along the length ofthe flute moved of their own accord.
<br>&quot;It's a little different from the&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; Fallom said, alittle breathlessly, as though the breath that had been activating theflute had been her own instead of power-driven air.
<br>Pelorat said to Trevize, &quot;She must be getting the energy from theelectric current that feeds the fluorescents.&quot;<br>

&quot;Try again,&quot; said Hiroko in a choked voice.
<br>Fallom closed her eyes. The note was softer now and under firmercontrol. The flute played by itself, maneuvered by no fingers, but movedby distant energy, transduced through the still immature lobes of Fallom'sbrain. The notes which began as almost random settled into a musicalsuccession and now everyone in the hall had gathered around Hiroko andFallom, as Hiroko held the flute gently with thumb and forefinger ateither end, and Fallom, eyes closed, directed the current of air andthe movement of the keys.
<br>&quot;It's the piece I played,&quot; whispered Hiroko.
<br>&quot;I remember it,&quot; said Fallom, nodding her head slightly, trying notto break her concentration.
<br>&quot;Thou didst not miss a note,&quot; said Hiroko, when it was done.
<br>&quot;But it's not right, Hiroko. You didn't do it right.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Fallom! That's not polite. You mustn't &quot;<br>

&quot;Please,&quot; said Hiroko peremptorily, &quot;do not interfere. Why is it notright, child?&quot;<br>

&quot;Because I would play it differently.&quot;<br>

&quot;Show me, then.&quot;Again the flute played, but in more complicated fashion, for the forcesthat pushed the keys did so more quickly, in more rapid succession andin more elaborate combinations than before. The music was more complex,and infinitely more emotional and moving. Hiroko stood rigid and therewas not a sound to be heard anywhere in the room.
<br>Even after Fallom had finished playing, there was not a sound untilHiroko drew a deep breath and said, &quot;Little one, hast thou ever playedthat before?&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Fallom, &quot;before this I could only use my fingers, andI can't do my fingers like that.&quot; Then, simply and with no trace ofvaunting, &quot;No one can.&quot;<br>

&quot;Canst thou play anything else?&quot;<br>

&quot;I can make something up.&quot;<br>

&quot;Dost thou mean improvise?&quot;Fallom frowned at the word and looked toward Bliss. Bliss nodded andFallom said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>

&quot;Please do so, then,&quot; said Hiroko.
<br>Fallom paused and thought for a minute or two, then began slowly,in a very simple succession of notes, the whole being rather dreamy. Thefluorescent lights dimmed and brightened as the amount of power exertedintensified and faded. No one seemed to notice, for it seemed to be theeffect of the music rather than the cause, as though a ghostly electricalspirit were obeying the dictates of the sound waves.
<br>The combination of notes then repeated itself a bit more loudly, thena bit more complexly, then in variations that, without ever losing theclearly heard basic combination, became more stirring and more excitinguntil it was almost impossible to breathe. And finally, it descendedmuch more rapidly than it had ascended and did so with the effect ofa swooping dive that brought the listeners to ground level even whilethey still retained the feeling that they were high in the air.
<br>There followed sheer pandemonium that split the air, and even Trevize,who was used to a totally different kind of music, thought sadly,&quot;And now I'll never hear that again.&quot;When a most reluctant quiet had returned, Hiroko held out herflute. &quot;Here, Fallom, this is thine!&quot;Fallom reached for it eagerly, but Bliss caught hold of the child'soutstretched arm and said, &quot;We can't take it, Hiroko. It's a valuableinstrument.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have another, Bliss. Not quite as good, but that is how it shouldbe. This instrument belongeth to the person who playeth it best. Neverhave I heard such music and it would be wrong for me to own an instrumentI cannot use to full potential. Would that I knew how the instrumentcould be made to play without being touched.&quot;Fallom took the flute and, with an expression of deep content, heldit tightly to her chest.
<br>83Each of the two rooms of their quarters were lit by onefluorescent light. The outhouse had a third. The lights were dim, and wereuncomfortable to read by, but at least the rooms were no longer dark.
<br>Yet they now lingered outside. The sky was full of stars, somethingthat was always fascinating to a native of Terminus, where the night skywas all but starless and in which only the faint foreshortened cloud ofthe Galaxy was prominent.
<br>Hiroko had accompanied them back to their chambers for fear they wouldget lost in the dark, or that they would stumble. All the way back, sheheld Fallom's hand, and then, after lighting the fluorescents for them,remained outside with them, still clutching at the youngster.
<br>Bliss tried again, for it was clear to her that Hiroko was in a stateof a difficult conflict of emotions. &quot;Really, Hiroko, we cannot takeyour flute.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, Fallom must have it.&quot; But she seemed on edge just the same.
<br>Trevize continued to look at the sky. The night was truly dark,a darkness that was scarcely affected by the trickle of light fromtheir own chambers; and much less so by the tiny sparks of other housesfarther off.
<br>He said, &quot;Hiroko, do you see that star that is so bright? What isit called?&quot;Hiroko looked up casually and said, with no great appearance ofinterest, &quot;That's the Companion.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why is it called that?&quot;<br>

&quot;It circleth our sun every eighty Standard Years. It is an eveningstar at this time of year. Thou canst see it in daytime, too, when itlieth above the horizon.&quot;Good, thought Trevize. She's not totally ignorant of astronomy. Hesaid, &quot;Do you know that Alpha has another companion, a very small, dimone that's much much farther away than that bright star. You can't seeit without a telescope.&quot; (He hadn't seen it himself, hadn't botheredto search for it, but the ship's computer had the information in itsmemory banks.)She said indifferently, &quot;We were told that in school.&quot;<br>

&quot;But now what about that one? You see those six stars in a zigzagline?&quot;Hiroko said, &quot;That is Cassiopeia.&quot;<br>

&quot;Really?&quot; said Trevize, startled. &quot;Which star?&quot;<br>

&quot;All of them. The whole zigzag. It is Cassiopeia.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why is it called that?&quot;<br>

&quot;I lack the knowledge. I know nothing of astronomy, respectedTrevize.&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you see the lowermost star in the zigzag, the one that's brighterthan the other stars? What is that?&quot;<br>

&quot;It is a star. I know not its name.&quot;<br>

&quot;But except for the two companion stars, it's the closest of all thestars to Alpha. It is only a parsec away.&quot;Hiroko said, &quot;Sayest thou so? I know that not.&quot;<br>

&quot;Might it not be the star about which Earth revolves?&quot;Hiroko looked at the star with a faint flash of interest. &quot;I knownot. I have never heard any person say so.&quot;<br>

&quot;Don't you think it might be?&quot;<br>

&quot;How can I say? None knoweth where Earth might be. I I mustleave thee, now. I will be taking my shift in the fields tomorrowmorning before the beach festival. I'll see you all there, right afterlunch. Yes? Yes?&quot;<br>

&quot;Certainly, Hiroko.&quot;She left suddenly, half-running in the dark. Trevize looked after her,then followed the others into the dimly lit cottage.
<br>He said, &quot;Can you tell whether she was lying about Earth, Bliss?&quot;Bliss shook her head. &quot;I don't think she was. She is under enormoustension, something I was not aware of until after the concert. It existedbefore you asked her about the stars.&quot;<br>

&quot;Because she gave away her flute, then?&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps. I can't tell.&quot; She turned to Fallom. &quot;Now, Fallom, I wantyou to go into your room. When you're ready for bed, go to the outhouse,use the potty, then wash your hands, your face, and your teeth.&quot;<br>

&quot;I would like to play the flute, Bliss.&quot;<br>

&quot;Just for a little while, and very quietly. Do you understand,Fallom? And you must stop when I tell you to.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, Bliss.&quot;The three were now alone; Bliss in the one chair and the men sittingeach on his cot.
<br>Bliss said, &quot;Is there any point in staying on this planet anylonger?&quot;Trevize shrugged. &quot;We never did get to discuss Earth in connectionwith the ancient instruments, and we might find something there. Itmight also pay to wait for the fishing fleet to return. The men mightknow something the stay-at-homes don't.&quot;<br>

&quot; Very unlikely, I think,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Are you sure it'snot Hiroko's dark eyes that hold you?&quot;Trevize said impatiently, &quot;I don't understand, Bliss. What have youto do with what I choose to do? Why do you seem to arrogate to yourselfthe right of sitting in moral judgment on me?&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm not concerned with your morals. The matter affects ourexpedition. You want to find Earth so that you can finally decidewhether you are right in choosing Galaxia over Isolate worlds. I wantyou to so decide. You say you need to visit Earth to make the decisionand you seem to be convinced that Earth revolves about that bright starin the sky. Let us go there, then. I admit it would be useful to havesome information about it before we go, but it is clear to me that theinformation is not forthcoming here. I do not wish to remain simplybecause you enjoy Hiroko.&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps we'll leave,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Let me think about it, andHiroko will play no part in my decision, I assure you.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I feel we ought to move on to Earth, if only to seewhether it is radioactive or not. I see no point in waiting longer.&quot;<br>

&quot;Are you sure it's not Bliss's dark eyes that drive you?&quot; saidTrevize, a bit spitefully. Then, almost at once, &quot;No, I take that back,Janov. I was just being childish. Still this is a charming world,quite apart from Hiroko, and I must say that under other circumstances,I would be tempted to remain indefinitely. Don't you think, Bliss,that Alpha destroys your theory about Isolates?&quot;<br>

&quot;In what way?&quot; asked Bliss.
<br>&quot;You've been maintaining that every truly isolated world turnsdangerous and hostile.&quot;<br>

&quot;Even Comporellon,&quot; said Bliss evenly, &quot;which is rather out of themain current of Galactic activity for all that it is, in theory, anAssociated Power of the Foundation Federation.&quot;<br>

&quot;But not Alpha. This world is totally isolated, butcan you complain of their friendliness and hospitality? They feed us,clothe us, shelter us, put on festivals in our honor, urge us to stayon. What fault is there to find with them?&quot;<br>

&quot;None, apparently. Hiroko even gives you her body.&quot;Trevize said angrily, &quot;Bliss, what bothers you about that? She didn'tgive me her body. We gave each other our bodies. It was entirely mutual,entirely pleasurable. Nor can you say that you hesitate to give yourbody as it suits you.&quot;<br>

&quot;Please, Bliss,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Golan is entirely right. There is noreason to object to his private pleasures.&quot;<br>

&quot;As long as they don't affect us,&quot; said Bliss obdurately.
<br>&quot;They do not affect us,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;We will leave, I assure you. Adelay to search further for information will not be long.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yet I don't trust Isolates,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;even when they comebearing gifts.&quot;Trevize flung up his arms. &quot;Reach a conclusion, then twist the evidenceto fit. How like a &quot;<br>

&quot;Don't say it,&quot; said Bliss dangerously. &quot;I am not a woman. I amGaia. It is Gaia, not I, who is uneasy.&quot;<br>

&quot;There is no reason to &quot; And at that point there was a scratchingat the door.
<br>Trevize froze. &quot;What's that?&quot; he said, in a low voice.
<br>Bliss shrugged lightly. &quot;Open the door and see. You tell us this isa kindly world that offers no danger.&quot;Nevertheless, Trevize hesitated, until a soft voice from the otherside of the door called out softly, &quot;Please. It is I!&quot;It was Hiroko's voice. Trevize threw the door open.
<br>Hiroko entered quickly. Her cheeks were wet.
<br>&quot;Close the door,&quot; she gasped.
<br>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Bliss.
<br>Hiroko clutched at Trevize. &quot;I could not stay away. I tried, but Iendured it not. Go thou, and all of you. Take the youngster with youquickly. Take the ship away&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Alpha while it isyet dark.&quot;<br>

&quot;But why?&quot; asked Trevize.
<br>&quot;Because else wilt thou die; and all of you.&quot;84The three Outworlders stared frozenly at Hiroko fora long moment. Then Trevize said, &quot;Are you saying your people willkill us?&quot;Hiroko said, as the tears rolled down her cheeks, &quot;Thou art already onthe road to death, respected Trevize. And the others with you. Longago, those of learning devised a virus, harmless to us, but deadlyto Outworlders. We have been made immune.&quot; She shook Trevize's arm indistraction. &quot;Thou art infected.&quot;<br>

&quot;How?&quot;<br>

&quot;When we had our pleasure. It is one way.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;But I feel entirely well.&quot;<br>

&quot;The virus is as yet inactive. It will be made active when the fishingfleet returns. By our laws, all must decide on such a thing eventhe men. All will surely decide it must be done, and we keep you heretill that time, two mornings hence. Leave now while it is yet dark andnone suspects.&quot;Bliss said sharply, &quot;Why do your people do this?&quot;<br>

&quot;For our safety. We are few and have much. We do not wish Outworldersto intrude. If one cometh and then reporteth our lot, others will come,and so when, once in a long while, a ship arriveth, we must make certainit leaveth not.&quot;<br>

&quot;But then,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;why do you warn us away?&quot;<br>

&quot;Ask not the reason. Nay, but I will tell you, since I hear itagain. Listen &quot;From the next room, they could hear Fallom playing softly andinfinitely sweetly.
<br>Hiroko said, &quot;I cannot bear the destruction of that music, for theyoung one will also die.&quot;Trevize said sternly, &quot;Is that why you gave the flute toFallom? Because you knew you would have it once again when she wasdead?&quot;Hiroko looked horrified. &quot;Nay, that was not in my mind. And when itcame to mind at length, I knew it must not be done. Leave with the child,and with her, take the flute that I may never see it more. Thou wilt besafe back in space and, left inactive, the virus now in thy body willdie after a time. In return, I ask that none of you ever speak of thisworld, that none else may know of it.&quot;<br>

&quot;We will not speak of it,&quot; said Trevize.
<br>Hiroko looked up. In a lower voice, she said, &quot;May I not kiss theeonce ere thou leavest?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;No. I have been infected once and surely that isenough.&quot; And then, a little less roughly, he added, &quot;Don't cry. Peoplewill ask why you are crying and you'll be unable to reply. I'llforgive what you did to me in view of your present effort to save us.&quot;Hiroko straightened, carefully wiped her cheeks with the back ofher hands, took a deep breath, and said, &quot;I thank thee for that,&quot; andleft quickly.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;We will put out the light, and we will wait awhile,and then we will leave. Bliss, tell Fallom to stop playing herinstrument. Remember to take the flute, of course. Then we willmake our way to the ship, if we can find it in the dark.&quot;<br>

&quot;I will find it,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Clothing of mine is on board and,however dimly, that, too, is Gaia. Gaia will have no trouble findingGaia.&quot; And she vanished into her room to collect Fallom.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;Do you suppose that they've managed to damage our shipin order to keep us on the planet?&quot;<br>

&quot;They lack the technology to do it,&quot; said Trevize grimly. When Blissemerged, holding Fallom by the hand, Trevize put out the lights.
<br>They sat quietly in the dark for what seemed half the night, andmight have been half an hour. Then Trevize slowly and silently openedthe door. The sky seemed a bit more cloudy, but stars shone. High in thesky now was Cassiopeia, with what might be Earth's sun burning brightlyat its lower tip. The air was still and there was no sound.
<br>Carefully, Trevize stepped out, motioning the others to follow. Oneof his hands dropped, almost automatically, to the butt of his neuronicwhip. He was sure he would not have to use it, but Bliss took the lead, holding Pelorat's hand, who heldTrevize's. Bliss's other hand held Fallom, and Fallom's other hand heldthe flute. Feeling gently with her feet in the nearly total darkness,Bliss guided the others toward where she felt, very weakly, the Gaia-nessof her clothing on board the Far Star .

   85The Far Star took off quietly, rising slowlythrough the atmosphere, leaving the dark island below. The few faintdots of light beneath them dimmed and vanished, and as the atmospheregrew thinner with height, the ship's speed grew greater, and the dotsof light in the sky above them grew more numerous and brighter.
<br>Eventually, they looked down upon the planet, Alpha, with only acrescent illuminated and that crescent largely wreathed in clouds.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;I suppose they don't have an active spacetechnology. They can't follow us.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm not sure that that cheers me up much,&quot; said Trevize, his facedour, his voice disheartened. &quot;I'm infected.&quot;<br>

&quot;But with an inactive strain,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;Still, it can be made active. They had a method. What is themethod?&quot;Bliss shrugged. &quot;Hiroko said the virus, left inactive, would eventuallydie in a body unadapted to it as yours is.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes?&quot; said Trevize angrily. &quot;How does she know that? For that matter,how do I know that Hiroko's statement wasn't a self-consoling lie? Andisn't it possible that the method of activation, whatever it is, mightnot be duplicated naturally? A particular chemical, a type of radiation,a a who knows what? I may sicken suddenly, and then thethree of you would die, too. Or if it happens after we have reached apopulated world, there may be a vicious pandemic which fleeing refugeeswould carry to other worlds.&quot;He looked at Bliss. &quot;Is there something you can do about it?&quot;Slowly, Bliss shook her head. &quot;Not easily. There are parasites makingup Gaia microorganisms, worms. They are a benign part of theecological balance. They live and contribute to the world consciousness,but never overgrow. They live without doing noticeable harm. The troubleis, Trevize, the virus that affects you is not part of Gaia.&quot;<br>

&quot;You say `not easily,'&quot; said Trevize, frowning. &quot;Under thecircumstances, can you take the trouble to do it even though it mightbe difficult? Can you locate the virus in me and destroy it? Can you,failing that, at least strengthen my defenses?&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you realize what you ask, Trevize? I am not acquainted with themicroscopic flora of your body. I might not easily tell a virus in thecells of your body from the normal genes inhabiting them. It would be evenmore difficult to distinguish between viruses your body is accustomed toand those with which Hiroko infected you. I will try to do it, Trevize,but it will take time and I may not succeed.&quot;<br>

&quot;Take time,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Try.&quot;<br>

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;If Hiroko told the truth, Bliss, you might be able tofind viruses that seem to be already diminishing in vitality, and youcould accelerate their decline.&quot;<br>

&quot;I could do that,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;It is a good thought.&quot;<br>

&quot;You won't weaken?&quot; said Trevize. &quot;You will have to destroy preciousbits of life when you kill those viruses, you know.&quot;<br>

&quot;You are being sardonic, Trevize,&quot; said Bliss coolly, &quot;but, sardonicor not, you are pointing out a true difficulty. Still, I can scarcelyfail to put you ahead of the virus. I will kill them if I have thechance, never fear. After all, even if I fail to consider you&quot; andher mouth twitched as though she were repressing a smile &quot;thencertainly Pelorat and Fallom are also at risk, and you might feel moreconfidence in my feeling for them than in my feeling for you. You mighteven remember that I myself am at risk.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have no faith in your self-love,&quot; muttered Trevize. &quot;You'reperfectly ready to give up your life for some high motive. I'll acceptyour concern for Pelorat, however.&quot; Then, he said, &quot;I don't hear Fallom'sflute. Is anything wrong with her?&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;She's asleep. A perfectly natural sleep that Ihad nothing to do with. And I would suggest that, after you work out theJump to the star we think is Earth's sun, we all do likewise. I need itbadly and I suspect you do, too, Trevize.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, if I can manage. You were right, you know, Bliss.&quot;<br>

&quot;About what, Trevize?&quot;<br>

&quot;About Isolates. New Earth was not a paradise, however much itmight have seemed like one. That hospitality all that outgoingfriendliness at first was to put us off our guard, so that oneof us might be easily infected. And all the hospitality afterward,the festivals of this and that, were designed to keep us there till thefishing fleet returned and the activation could be carried through. Andit would have worked but for Fallom and her music. It might be you wereright there, too.&quot;<br>

&quot;About Fallom?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. I didn't want to take her along, and I've never been happy withher being on the ship. It was your doing, Bliss, that we have her hereand it was she who, unwittingly, saved us. And yet &quot;<br>

&quot;And yet what?&quot;<br>

&quot;Despite that, I'm still uneasy at Fallom's presence. Idon't know why.&quot;<br>

&quot;If it will make you feel better, Trevize, I don't know that we canlay all the credit at Fallom's feet. Hiroko advanced Fallom's music asher excuse for committing what the other Alphans would surely considerto be an act of treason. She may even have believed this, but there wassomething in her mind in addition, something that I vaguely detectedbut could not surely identify, something that perhaps she was ashamed tolet emerge into her conscious mind. I am under the impression that shefelt a warmth for you, and would not willingly see you die, regardlessof Fallom and her music.&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; said Trevize, smiling slightly for thefirst time since they had left Alpha.<br />
&quot;I think so. You must have a certain proficiency at dealing withwomen. You persuaded Minister Lizalor to allow us to take our shipand leave Comporellon, and you helped influence Hiroko to save ourlives. Credit where it's due.&quot;Trevize smiled more broadly. &quot;Well, if you say so. On to Earth,then.&quot; He disappeared into the pilot-room with a step that was almostjaunty.
<br>Pelorat, lingering behind, said, &quot;You soothed him after all, didn'tyou, Bliss?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, Pelorat, I never touched his mind.&quot;<br>

&quot;You certainly did when you pampered his male vanity sooutrageously.&quot;<br>

&quot;Entirely indirect,&quot; said Bliss, smiling.
<br>&quot;Even so, thank you, Bliss.&quot;86After the Jump, the star that might well be Earth'ssun was still a tenth of a parsec away. It was the brightest object inthe sky by far, but it was still no more than a star.
<br>Trevize kept its light filtered for ease of viewing, and studiedit somberly.
<br>He said, &quot;There seems no doubt that it is the virtual twin of Alpha,the star that New Earth circles. Yet Alpha is in the computer map andthis star is not. We don't have a name for this star, we aren't givenits statistics, we lack any information concerning its planetary system,if it has one.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Isn't that what we would expect if Earth circlesthis sun? Such a blackout of information would fit with the fact thatall information about Earth seems to have been eliminated.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, but it could also mean that it's a Spacer world that justhappened not to be on the list on the wall of the Melpomenian building. Wecan't be altogether sure that that list was complete. Or this starcould be without planets and therefore perhaps not worth listing ona computer map which is primarily used for military and commercialpurposes. Janov, is there any legend that tells of Earth's sunbeing a mere parsec or so from a twin of itself.&quot;Pelorat shook his head. &quot;I'm sorry, Golan, but no such legend occursto me. There may be one, though. My memory isn't perfect. I'll searchfor it.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's not important. Is there any name given to Earth's sun?&quot;<br>

&quot;Some different names are given. I imagine there must be a name ineach of the different languages.&quot;<br>

&quot;I keep forgetting that Earth had many languages.&quot;<br>

&quot;It must have had. It's the only way of making sense out of many ofthe legends.&quot;Trevize said peevishly, &quot;Well, then, what do we do? We can't tellanything about the planetary system from this distance, and we have tomove closer. I would like to be cautious, but there's such a thing asexcessive and unreasoning caution, and I see no evidence of possibledanger. Presumably anything powerful enough to wipe the Galaxy clean ofinformation about Earth may be powerful enough to wipe us out even atthis distance if they seriously did not wish to be located, but nothing'shappened. It isn't rational to stay here forever on the mere possibilitythat something might happen if we move closer, is it?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I take it the computer detects nothing that might beinterpreted as dangerous.&quot;<br>

&quot;When I say I see no evidence of possible danger, it's the computerI'm relying on. I certainly can't see anything with the unaided eye. Iwouldn't expect to.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then I take it you're just looking for support in making what youconsider a risky decision. All right, then. I'm with you. We haven'tcome this far in order to turn back for no reason, have we?&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;What do you say, Pelorat?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I'm willing to move on, if only out of curiosity. Itwould be unbearable to go back without knowing if we have foundEarth.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;we're all agreed.&quot;<br>

&quot;Not all,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;There's Fallom.&quot;Trevize looked astonished. &quot;Are you suggesting we consult the child? Ofwhat value would her opinion be even if she had one? Besides, all shewould want would be to get back to her own world.&quot;<br>

&quot;Can you blame her for that?&quot; asked Bliss warmly.
<br>And because the matter of Fallom had arisen, Trevize became aware ofher flute, which was sounding in a rather stirring march rhythm.
<br>&quot;Listen to her,&quot; he said. &quot;Where has she ever heard anything inmarch rhythm?&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps Jemby played marches on the flute for her.&quot;Trevize shook his head. &quot;I doubt it. Dance rhythms, I should think,lullabies. Listen, Fallom makes me uneasy. She learns tooquickly.&quot;<br>

&quot;I help her,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Remember that. Andshe's very intelligent and she has been extraordinarilystimulated in the time she's been with us. New sensations have floodedher mind. She's seen space, different worlds, many people, all for thefirst time.&quot;Fallom's march music grew wilder and more richly barbaric.
<br>Trevize sighed and said, &quot;Well, she's here, and she's producing musicthat seems to breathe optimism, and delight in adventure. I'll take thatas her vote in favor of moving in more closely. Let us do so cautiously,then, and check this sun's planetary system.&quot;<br>

&quot;If any,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>Trevize smiled thinly. &quot;There's a planetary system. It's a bet. Chooseyour sum.&quot;87&quot;You lose,&quot; said Trevize abstractedly. &quot;How much moneydid you decide to bet?&quot;<br>

&quot;None. I never accepted the wager,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;Just as well. I wouldn't like to accept the money, anyway.&quot;They were some 10 billion kilometers from the sun. It was stillstar-like, but it was nearly 1/4,000 as bright as the average sun wouldhave been when viewed from the surface of a habitable planet.
<br>&quot;We can see two planets under magnification, right now,&quot; saidTrevize. &quot;From their measured diameters and from the spectrum of thereflected light, they are clearly gas giants.&quot;The ship was well outside the planetary plane, and Bliss and Pelorat,staring over Trevize's shoulder at the viewscreen, found themselveslooking at two tiny crescents of greenish light. The smaller was in thesomewhat thicker phase of the two.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;Janov! It is correct, isn't it, that Earth's sun issuppose to have four gas giants.&quot;<br>

&quot;According to the legends. Yes,&quot; said Pelorat.
<br>&quot;The nearest of the four to the sun is the largest, and the secondnearest has rings. Right?&quot;<br>

&quot;Large prominent rings, Golan. Yes. Just the same, old chap, you haveto allow for exaggeration in the telling and retelling of a legend. If weshould not find a planet with an extraordinary ring system, I don't thinkwe ought to let that count seriously against this being Earth's star.&quot;<br>

&quot;Nevertheless, the two we see may be the farthest, and the twonearer ones may well be on the other side of the sun and too far to beeasily located against the background of stars. We'll have to move stillcloser and beyond the sun to the other side.&quot;<br>

&quot;Can that be done in the presence of the star's nearby mass?&quot;<br>

&quot;With reasonable caution, the computer can do it, I'm sure. If itjudges the danger to be too great, however, it will refuse to budge us,and we can then move in cautious, smaller steps.&quot;His mind directed the computer and the starfield on theviewscreen changed. The star brightened sharply and then moved off theviewscreen as the computer, following directions, scanned the sky foranother gas giant. It did so successfully.
<br>All three onlookers stiffened and stared, while Trevize's mind,almost helpless with astonishment, fumbled at the computer to directfurther magnification.
<br>&quot;Incredible,&quot; gasped Bliss.
<br>88A gas giant was in view, seen at an angle that allowedmost of it to be sunlit. About it, there curved a broad and brilliantring of material, tipped so as to catch the sunlight on the side beingviewed. It was brighter than the planet itself and along it, one thirdof the way in toward the planet, was a narrow, dividing line.
<br>Trevize threw in a request for maximum enhancement and the ring becameringlets, narrow and concentric, glittering in the sunlight. Only aportion of the ring system was visible on the viewscreen and the planetitself had moved off. A further direction from Trevize and one cornerof the screen marked itself off and showed, within itself, a miniatureof the planet and rings under lesser magnification.
<br>&quot;Is that sort of thing common?&quot; asked Bliss, awed.
<br>&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Almost every gas giant has rings of debris, butthey tend to be faint and narrow. I once saw one in which the rings werenarrow, but quite bright. But I never saw anything like this; or heardof it, either.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;That's clearly the ringed giant the legends speakof. If this is really unique &quot;<br>

&quot;Really unique, as far as I know, or as far as the computer knows,&quot;said Trevize.
<br>&quot;Then this must be the planetary system containingEarth. Surely, no one could invent such a planet. It would have had tohave been seen to be described.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I'm prepared to believe just about anything your legendssay now. This is the sixth planet and Earth would be the third?&quot;<br>

&quot;Right, Golan.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then I would say we were less than 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth,and we haven't been stopped. Gaia stopped us when we approached.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;You were closer to Gaia when you were stopped.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but it's my opinion Earth is more powerful thanGaia, and I take this to be a good sign. If we are not stopped, it maybe that Earth does not object to our approach.&quot;<br>

&quot;Or that there is no Earth,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;Do you care to bet this time?&quot; asked Trevize grimly.
<br>&quot;What I think Bliss means,&quot; put in Pelorat, &quot;is that Earth may beradioactive as everyone seems to think, and that no one stops us becausethere is no life on the Earth.&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize violently. &quot;I'll believe everything that's saidabout Earth, but that. We'll just close in on Earth andsee for ourselves. And I have the feeling we won't be stopped.&quot;89The gas giants were well behind. An asteroid beltlay just inside the gas giant nearest the sun. (That gas giant was thelargest and most massive, just as the legends said.)Inside the asteroid belt were four planets.
<br>Trevize studied them carefully. &quot;The third is the largest. The sizeis appropriate and the distance from the sun is appropriate. It couldbe habitable.&quot;Pelorat caught what seemed to be a note of uncertainty in Trevize'swords.
<br>He said, &quot;Does it have an atmosphere?&quot;<br>

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The second, third, and fourth planets allhave atmospheres. And, as in the old children's tale, the second's istoo dense, the fourth's is not dense enough, but the third's is justright.&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you think it might be Earth, then?&quot;<br>

&quot;Think?&quot; said Trevize almost explosively. &quot;I don't have to think. Itis Earth. It has the giant satellite you told me of.&quot;<br>

&quot;It has?&quot; And Pelorat's face broke into a wider smile than any thatTrevize had ever seen upon it.
<br>&quot;Absolutely! Here, look at it under maximum magnification.&quot;Pelorat saw two crescents, one distinctly larger and brighter thanthe other.
<br>&quot;Is that smaller one the satellite?&quot; he asked.
<br>&quot;Yes. It's rather farther from the planet than one might expect butit's definitely revolving about it. It's only the size of a small planet;in fact, it's smaller than any of the four inner planets circling thesun. Still, it's large for a satellite. It's at least two thousandkilometers in diameter, which makes it in the size range of the largesatellites that revolve about gas giants.&quot;<br>

&quot;No larger?&quot; Pelorat seemed disappointed. &quot;Then it's not a giantsatellite?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, it is. A satellite with a diameter of two to three thousandkilometers that is circling an enormous gas giant is one thing. That samesatellite circling a small, rocky habitable planet is quite another. Thatsatellite has a diameter over a quarter that of Earth. Where have youheard of such near-parity involving a habitable planet?&quot;Pelorat said timidly, &quot;I know very little of such things.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Then take my word for it, Janov. It's unique. We'relooking at something that is practically a double planet, and there arefew habitable planets that have anything more than pebbles orbitingthem. Janov, if you consider that gas giant with its enormous ringsystem in sixth place, and this planet with its enormous satellite inthird both of which your legends told you about, against allcredibility, before you ever saw them then that world you'relooking at must be Earth. It cannot conceivably be anythingelse. We've found it, Janov; we've found it.&quot;90THey were on the second day of their coasting progresstoward Earth, and Bliss yawned over the dinner meal. She said, &quot;It seemsto me we've spent more time coasting toward and away from planets thananything else. We've spent weeks at it, literally.&quot;<br>

&quot;Partly,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;that's because Jumps are dangeroustoo close to a star. And in this case, we'removing very slowly because I do not wish to advance into possible dangertoo quickly.&quot;<br>

&quot;I thought you said you had the feeling we would not be stopped.&quot;<br>

&quot;So I do, but I don't want to stake everything on a feeling.&quot; Trevizelooked at the contents of the spoon before putting it into his mouthand said, &quot;You know, I miss the fish we had on Alpha. We only had threemeals there.&quot;<br>

&quot;A pity,&quot; agreed Pelorat.
<br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;we visited five worlds and had to leave eachone of them so hurriedly that we never had time to add to our foodsupplies and introduce variety. Even when the world had food to offer,as did Comporellon and Alpha, and, presumably &quot;She did not complete the sentence, for Fallom, looking up quickly,finished it for her. &quot;Solaria? Could you get no food there? There isplenty of food there. As much as on Alpha. And better, too.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know that, Fallom,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;There was just no time.&quot;Fallom stared at her solemnly. &quot;Will I ever see Jemby again,Bliss? Tell me the truth.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;You may, if we return to Solaria.&quot;<br>

&quot;Will we ever return to Solaria?&quot;Bliss hesitated. &quot;I cannot say.&quot;<br>

&quot;Now we go to Earth, is that right? Isn't that the planet where yousay we all originate?&quot;<br>

&quot;Where our forebears originated,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;I can say `ancestors,'&quot; said Fallom.
<br>&quot;Yes, we are going to Earth.&quot;Bliss said lightly, &quot;Wouldn't anyone wish to see the world of theirancestors?&quot;<br>

&quot;I think there's more to it. You all seem so concerned.&quot;<br>

&quot;But we've never been there before. We don't know what to expect.&quot;<br>

&quot;I think it is more than that.&quot;Bliss smiled. &quot;You've finished eating, Fallom dear, so why not goto the room and let us have a little serenade on your flute. You'replaying it more beautifully all the time. Come, come.&quot; She gave Falloman accelerating pat on the rear end, and off Fallom went, turning onlyonce to give Trevize a thoughtful look.
<br>Trevize looked after her with clear distaste. &quot;Does that thing readminds?&quot;<br>

&quot;Don't call her a `thing,' Trevize,&quot; said Bliss sharply.
<br>&quot;Does she read minds? You ought to be able to tell.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, she doesn't. Nor can Gaia. Nor can the SecondFoundationers. Reading minds in the sense of overhearing a conversation,or making out precise ideas is not something that can be done now, or inthe foreseeable future. We can detect, interpret, and, to some extent,manipulate emotions, but that is not the same thing at all.&quot;<br>

&quot;How do you know she can't do this thing that supposedly can't bedone?&quot;<br>

&quot;Because as you have just said, I ought to be able to tell.&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps she is manipulating you so that you remain ignorant of thefact that she can.&quot;Bliss rolled her eyes upward. &quot;Be reasonable, Trevize. Even if she hadunusual abilities, she could do nothing with me for I am not Bliss, I amGaia. You keep forgetting. Do you know the mental inertia representedby an entire planet? Do you think one Isolate, however talented, canovercome that?&quot;<br>

&quot;You don't know everything, Bliss, so don't be overconfident,&quot; saidTrevize sullenly. &quot;That th She has been with us notvery long. I couldn't learn anything but the rudiments of a language inthat time, yet she already speaks Galactic perfectly and with virtuallya full vocabulary. Yes, I know you've been helping her, but I wish youwould stop.&quot;<br>

&quot;I told you I was helping her, but I also told you she's fearfullyintelligent. Intelligent enough so that I would like to have her part ofGaia. If we can gather her in; if she's still young enough; we might learnenough about the Solarians to absorb that entire world eventually. Itmight well be useful to us.&quot;<br>

&quot;Does it occur to you that the Solarians are pathological Isolateseven by my standards?&quot;<br>

&quot;They wouldn't stay so as part of Gaia.&quot;<br>

&quot;I think you're wrong, Bliss. I think that Solarian child is dangerousand that we should get rid of her.&quot;<br>

&quot;How? Dump her through the airlock? Kill her, chop her up, and addher to our food supply?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Oh, Bliss.&quot;And Trevize said, &quot;That's disgusting, and completely uncalled for.&quot; Helistened for a moment. The flute was sounding without flaw or waver,and they had been talking in half-whispers. &quot;When this is all over, we'vegot to return her to Solaria, and make sure that Solaria is forever cutoff from the Galaxy. My own feeling is that it should be destroyed. Idistrust and fear it.&quot;Bliss thought awhile and said, &quot;Trevize, I know that you have the knackof coming to a right decision, but I also know you have been antipatheticto Fallom from the start. I suspect that may just be because you werehumiliated on Solaria and have taken a violent hatred to the planet andits inhabitants as a result. Since I must not tamper with your mind,I can't tell that for sure. Please remember that if we had not takenFallom with us, we would be on Alpha right now dead and, I presume,buried.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know that, Bliss, but even so &quot;<br>

&quot;And her intelligence is to be admired, not envied.&quot;<br>

&quot;I do not envy her. I fear her.&quot;<br>

&quot;Her intelligence?&quot;Trevize licked his lips thoughtfully. &quot;No, not quite.&quot;<br>

&quot;What, then?&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know. Bliss, if I knew what I feared, I might not have tofear it. It's something I don't quite understand.&quot; His voice lowered,as though he were speaking to himself. &quot;The Galaxy seems to be crowdedwith things I don't understand. Why did I choose Gaia? Why must I findEarth? Is there a missing assumption in psychohistory? If there is,what is it? And on top of all that, why does Fallom make me uneasy?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Unfortunately, I can't answer those questions.&quot; She rose,and left the room.
<br>Pelorat looked after her, then said, &quot;Surely things aren't totallyblack, Golan. We're getting closer and closer to Earth and once we reachit all mysteries may be solved. And so far nothing seems to be makingany effort to stop us from reaching it.&quot;Trevize's eyes flickered toward Pelorat and he said in a low voice,&quot;I wish something would.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;You do? Why should you want that?&quot;<br>

&quot;Frankly, I'd welcome a sign of life.&quot;Pelorat's eyes opened wide. &quot;Have you found that Earth is radioactiveafter all?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not quite. But it is warm. A bit warmer than I would haveexpected.&quot;<br>

&quot;Is that bad?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not necessarily. It may be rather warm but that wouldn't make itnecessarily uninhabitable. The cloud cover is thick and it is definitelywater vapor, so that those clouds, together with a copious water ocean,could tend to keep things livable despite the temperature we calculatedfrom microwave emission. I can't be sure, yet. It's just that &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, if Earth were radioactive, that might well account for itsbeing warmer than expected.&quot;<br>

&quot;But that doesn't argue the reverse, does it? If it's warmer thanexpected, that doesn't mean it must be radioactive.&quot;<br>

&quot;No. No, it doesn't.&quot; Trevize managed to force a smile. &quot;No usebrooding, Janov. In a day or two, I'll be able to tell more about itand we'll know for sure.&quot;91Fallom was sitting on the cot in deep thought whenBliss came into the room. Fallom looked up briefly, then down again.
<br>Bliss said quietly, &quot;What's the matter, Fallom?&quot;Fallom said, &quot;Why does Trevize dislike me so much, Bliss?&quot;<br>

&quot;What makes you think he dislikes you.&quot;<br>

&quot;He looks at me impatiently Is that the word?&quot;<br>

&quot;It might be the word.&quot;<br>

&quot;He looks at me impatiently when I am near him. His face always twistsa little.&quot;<br>

&quot;Trevize is having a hard time, Fallom.&quot;<br>

&quot;Because he's looking for Earth?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes.&quot;Fallom thought awhile, then said, &quot;He is particularly impatient whenI think something into moving.&quot;Bliss's lips tightened. &quot;Now, Fallom, didn't I tell you you must notdo that, especially when Trevize is present?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, it was yesterday, right here in this room, and he was in thedoorway and I didn't notice. I didn't know he was watching. It was justone of Pel's book-films, anyway, and I was trying to make it stand onone tip. I wasn't doing any harm.&quot;<br>

&quot;It makes him nervous, Fallom, and I want you not to do it, whetherhe's watching or not.&quot;<br>

&quot;Does it make him nervous because he can't do it?&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps.&quot;<br>

&quot;Can you do it?&quot;Bliss shook her head slowly. &quot;No, I can't.&quot;<br>

&quot;It doesn't make you nervous when I do it. It doesn't make Pel nervous,either.&quot;<br>

&quot;People are different.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know,&quot; said Fallom, with a sudden hardness that surprised Blissand caused her to frown.
<br>&quot;What do you know, Fallom?&quot;<br>

&quot; I'm different.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course, I just said so. People are different.&quot;<br>

&quot;My shape is different. I can move things.&quot;<br>

&quot;That's true.&quot;Fallom said, with a shade of rebelliousness, &quot;I must move things. Trevize should not be angry with me for that, and you shouldnot stop me.&quot;<br>

&quot;But why must you move things?&quot;<br>

&quot;It is practice. Exerceez. Is that the right word?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not quite. Exercise.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. Jemby always said I must train my my &quot;<br>

&quot;Transducer-lobes?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. And make them strong. Then, when I was grown up, I could powerall the robots. Even Jemby.&quot;<br>

&quot;Fallom, who did power all the robots if you did not?&quot;<br>

&quot;Bander.&quot; Fallom said it very matter-of-factly.
<br>&quot;Did you know Bander?&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course. I viewed him many times. I was to be the nextestate-head. The Bander estate would become the Fallom estate. Jembytold me so.&quot;<br>

&quot;You mean Bander came to your &quot;Fallom's mouth made a perfect O of shock. She said in a choked voice,&quot;Bander would never come to &quot; The youngster ran out of breath andpanted a bit, then said, &quot;I viewed Bander's image.&quot;Bliss asked hesitantly, &quot;How did Bander treat you?&quot;Fallom looked at Bliss with a faintly puzzled eye. &quot;Bander would askme if I needed anything; if I was comfortable. But Jemby was always nearme so I never needed anything and I was always comfortable.&quot;Her head bent and she stared at the floor. Then she placed her handsover her eyes and said, &quot;But Jemby stopped. I think it was because Banderstopped, too.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;<br>

&quot;I've been thinking about it. Bander powered all the robots, and ifJemby stopped, and all the other robots, too, it must be that Banderstopped. Isn't that so?&quot;Bliss was silent.
<br>Fallom said, &quot;But when you take me back to Solaria I will power Jembyand all the rest of the robots, and I will be happy again.&quot;She was sobbing.
<br>Bliss said, &quot;Aren't you happy with us, Fallom? Just alittle? Sometimes?&quot;Fallom lifted her tear-stained face to Bliss and her voice trembledas she shook her head and said, &quot;I want Jemby.&quot;In an agony of sympathy, Bliss threw her arms about the youngster. &quot;Oh,Fallom, how I wish I could bring you and Jemby together again,&quot; and wassuddenly aware that she was weeping, too.
<br>92Pelorat entered and found them so. He halted in mid-stepand said, &quot;What's the matter?&quot;Bliss detached herself and fumbled for a small tissue so that shemight wipe her eyes. She shook her head, and Pelorat at once said,with heightened concern, &quot;But what's the matter ?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Fallom, just rest a little. I'll think of something tomake things a little better for you. Remember I love you just thesame way that Jemby did.&quot;She seized Pelorat's elbow and rushed him out into the living room,saying, &quot;It's nothing, Pel. Nothing.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's Fallom, though, isn't it? She still misses Jemby.&quot;<br>

&quot;Terribly. And there's nothing we can do about it. I can tell herthat I love her and, truthfully, I do. How can you help loving achild so intelligent and gentle? Fearfully intelligent. Trevizethinks too intelligent. She's seen Bander in her time,you know or viewed it, rather, as a holographic image. She's notmoved by that memory, however; she's very cold and matter-of-fact aboutit, and I can understand why. There was only the fact that Bander wasowner of the estate and that Fallom would be the next owner that boundthem. No other relationship at all.&quot;<br>

&quot;Does Fallom understand that Bander is her father?&quot;<br>

&quot;Her mother . If we agree that Fallom is to be regardedas feminine, so is Bander.&quot;<br>

&quot;Either way, Bliss dear. Is Fallom aware of the parentalrelationship?&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know that she would understand what that is. She may, ofcourse, but she gave no hint. However, Pel, she has reasoned out thatBander is dead, for it's dawned on her that Jemby's inactivation must bethe result of power loss and since Bander supplied the power Thatfrightens me.&quot;Pelorat said thoughtfully, &quot;Why should it, Bliss? It's only a logicalinference, after all.&quot;<br>

&quot;Another logical inference can be drawn from that death. Deathsmust be few and far distant on Solaria with its long-lived and isolatedSpacers. Experience of natural death must be a limited one for any ofthem, and probably absent altogether for a Solarian child of Fallom'sage. If Fallom continues to think of Bander's death, she's going to beginto wonder why Bander died, and the fact that it happenedwhen we strangers were on the planet will surely lead her to the obviouscause and effect.&quot;<br>

&quot;That we killed Bander?&quot;<br>

&quot;It wasn't we who killed Bander, Pel. It was I .&quot;<br>

&quot;She couldn't guess that.&quot;<br>

&quot;But I would have to tell her that. She is annoyed with Trevize as itis, and he is clearly the leader of the expedition. She would take itfor granted that it would be he who would have brought about the deathof Bander, and how could I allow Trevize to bear the blame unjustly?&quot;<br>

&quot;What would it matter, Bliss? The child feels nothing for herfath mother. Only for her robot, Jemby.&quot;<br>

&quot;But the death of the mother meant the death of her robot, too. Ialmost did own up to my responsibility. I was strongly tempted.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why?&quot;<br>

&quot;So I could explain it my way. So I could soothe her, forestall herown discovery of the fact in a reasoning process that would work it outin a way that would offer no justification for it.&quot;<br>

&quot;But there was justification. It was self-defense. Ina moment, we all would have been dead, if you had not acted.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's what I would have said, but I could not bring myself toexplain. I was afraid she wouldn't believe me.&quot;Pelorat shook his head. He said, sighing, &quot;Do you suppose it mighthave been better if we had not brought her? The situation makes youso unhappy.&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; said Bliss angrily, &quot;don't say that. It would have mademe infinitely more unhappy to have to sit here right now and rememberthat we had left an innocent child behind to be slaughtered mercilesslybecause of what we had done.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's the way of Fallom's world.&quot;<br>

&quot;Now, Pel, don't fall into Trevize's way of thinking. Isolatesfind it possible to accept such things and think no more about it. Theway of Gaia is to save life, however, not destroy it or to sitidly by while it is destroyed. Life of all kinds must, we all know,constantly be coming to an end in order that other life might endure,but never uselessly, never to no end. Bander's death, though unavoidable,is hard enough to bear; Fallom's would have been past all bounds.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah well,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;I suppose you're right. And in anycase, it is not the problem of Fallom concerning which I've come to seeyou. It's Trevize.&quot;<br>

&quot;What about Trevize?&quot;<br>

&quot;Bliss, I'm worried about him. He's waiting to determine the factsabout Earth, and I'm not sure he can withstand the strain.&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't fear for him. I suspect he has a sturdy and stable mind.&quot;<br>

&quot;We all have our limits. Listen, the planet Earth is warmer than heexpected it to be; he told me so. I suspect that he thinks it may be toowarm for life, though he's clearly trying to talk himself into believingthat's not so.&quot;<br>

&quot;Maybe he's right. Maybe it's not too warm for life.&quot;<br>

&quot;Also, he admits it's possible that the warmth might possibly arisefrom a radioactive crust, but he is refusing to believe that also. -Ina day or two, we'll be close enough so that the truth of the matter willbe unmistakable. What if Earth is radioactive?&quot;<br>

&quot;Then he'll have to accept the fact.&quot;<br>

&quot;But I don't know how to say this, or how to put it in mentalterms. What if his mind &quot;Bliss waited, then said wryly, &quot;Blows a fuse?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. Blows a fuse. Shouldn't you do something now to strengthenhim? Keep him level and under control, so to speak?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, Pel. I can't believe he's that fragile, and there is a firmGaian decision that his mind must not be tampered with.&quot;<br>

&quot;But that's the very point. He has this unusual `rightness,' orwhatever you want to call it. The shock of his entire project fallingto nothingness at the moment when it seems successfully concluded maynot destroy his brain, but it may destroy his `rightness.' It's a veryunusual property he has. Might it not be unusually fragile, too?&quot;Bliss remained for a moment in thought. Then she shrugged. &quot;Well,perhaps I'll keep an eye on him.&quot;93For the next thirty-six hours, Trevize was vaguelyaware that Bliss and, to a lesser degree, Pelorat, tended to dog hisfootsteps. Still, that was not utterly unusual in a ship as compact astheirs, and he had other things on his mind.
<br>Now, as he sat at the computer, he was aware of them standing justinside the doorway. He looked up at them, his face blank.
<br>&quot;Well?&quot; he said, in a very quiet voice.
<br>Pelorat said, rather awkwardly, &quot;How are you, Golan?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Ask Bliss. She's been staring at me intently forhours. She must be poking through my mind. Aren't you, Bliss?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, I am not,&quot; said Bliss evenly, &quot;but if you feel the need for myhelp, I can try. Do you want my help?&quot;<br>

&quot;No, why should I? Leave me alone. Both of you.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Please tell us what's going on.&quot;<br>

&quot;Guess!&quot;<br>

&quot;Is Earth &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, it is. What everyone insisted on telling us is perfectlytrue.&quot; Trevize gestured at the viewscreen, where Earth presented itsnightside and was eclipsing the sun. It was a solid circle of blackagainst the starry sky, its circumference outlined by a broken orangecurve.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;Is that orange the radioactivity?&quot;<br>

&quot;No. Just refracted sunlight through the atmosphere. It would bea solid orange circle if the atmosphere weren't so cloudy. We can'tsee the radioactivity. The various radiations, even the gamma rays, areabsorbed by the atmosphere. However, they do set up secondary radiations,comparatively feeble ones, but the computer can detect them. They'restill invisible to the eye, but the computer can produce a photon ofvisible light for each particle or wave of radiation it receives andput Earth into false color. Look.&quot;And the black circle glowed with a faint, blotchy blue.
<br>&quot;How much radioactivity is there?&quot; asked Bliss, in a low voice. &quot;Enoughto signify that no human life can exist there?&quot;<br>

&quot;No life of any kind,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The planet is uninhabitable. Thelast bacterium, the last virus, is long gone.&quot;<br>

&quot;Can we explore it?&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;I mean, in space suits.&quot;<br>

&quot;For a few hours before we come down with irreversible radiationsickness.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then what do we do, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;Do?&quot; Trevize looked at Pelorat with that same expressionlessface. &quot;Do you know what I would like to do? I would like to take youand Bliss and the child back to Gaia and leave you allthere forever. Then I would like to go back to Terminus and hand backthe ship. Then I would like to resign from the Council, which ought tomake Mayor Branno very happy. Then I would like to live on my pensionand let the Galaxy go as it will. I won't care about the Seldon Plan, orabout the Foundation, or about the Second Foundation, or about Gaia. TheGalaxy can choose its own path. It will last my time and why should Icare a snap as to what happens afterward?&quot;<br>

&quot;Surely, you don't mean it, Golan,&quot; said Pelorat urgently.
<br>Trevize stared at him for a while, and then he drew a long breath. &quot;No,I don't, but, oh, how I wish I could do exactly what I have just outlinedto you.&quot;<br>

&quot;Never mind that. What will you do?&quot;<br>

&quot;Keep the ship in orbit about the Earth, rest, get over the shock ofall this, and think of what to do next. Except that &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes?&quot;And Trevize blurted out, &quot;What can I do next? What is there furtherto look for? What is there further to find?&quot;

   94For four successive meals, Pelorat and Bliss had seenTrevize only at meals. During the rest of the time, he was either inthe pilot-room or in his bedroom. At mealtimes, he was silent. His lipsremained pressed together and he ate little.
<br>At the fourth meal, however, it seemed to Pelorat that some ofthe unusual gravity had lifted from Trevize's countenance. Peloratcleared his throat twice, as though preparing to say something and thenretreating.
<br>Finally, Trevize looked up at him and said, &quot;Well?&quot;<br>

&quot;Have you have you thought it out, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br>

&quot;You seem less gloomy.&quot;<br>

&quot;I'm not less gloomy, but I have beenthinking. Heavily.&quot;<br>

&quot;May we know what?&quot; asked Pelorat.
<br>Trevize glanced briefly in Bliss's direction. She was looking firmlyat her plate, maintaining a careful silence, as though certain thatPelorat would get further than she at this sensitive moment.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;Are you also curious, Bliss?&quot;She raised her eyes for a moment. &quot;Yes. Certainly.&quot;Fallom kicked a leg of the table moodily, and said, &quot;Have we foundEarth?&quot;Bliss squeezed the youngster's shoulder. Trevize paid no attention.
<br>He said, &quot;What we must start with is a basic fact. All informationconcerning Earth has been removed on various worlds. That is bound tobring us to an inescapable conclusion. Something on Earth is beinghidden. And yet, by observation, we see that Earth is radioactivelydeadly, so that anything on it is automatically hidden. No one can landon it, and from this distance, when we are quite near the outer edge ofthe magnetosphere and would not care to approach Earth any more closely,there is nothing for us to find.&quot;<br>

&quot;Can you be sure of that?&quot; asked Bliss softly.
<br>&quot;I have spent my time at the computer, analyzing Earth in every wayit and I can. There is nothing. What's more, I feel there isnothing. Why, then, has data concerning the Earth been wiped out? Surely,whatever must be hidden is more effectively hidden now than anyone caneasily imagine, and there need be no human gilding of this particularpiece of gold.&quot;<br>

&quot;It may be,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that there was indeed something hiddenon Earth at a time when it had not yet grown so severely radioactive asto preclude visitors. People on Earth may then have feared that someonemight land and find this whatever-it-is. It was then thatEarth tried to remove information concerning itself. What we have nowis a vestigial remnant of that insecure time.&quot;<br>

&quot;No, I don't think so,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The removal of informationfrom the Imperial Library at Trantor seems to have taken place veryrecently.&quot; He turned suddenly to Bliss, &quot;Am I right?&quot;Bliss said evenly, &quot;I/we/Gaia gathered that much from the troubledmind of the Second Foundationer Gendibal, when he, you, and I had themeeting with the Mayor of Terminus.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;So whatever must have had to be hidden because thereexisted the chance of finding it must still be in hiding now ,and there must be danger of finding it now despite the factthat Earth is radioactive.&quot;<br>

&quot;How is that possible?&quot; asked Pelorat anxiously.
<br>&quot;Consider,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;What if what was on Earth is no longeron Earth, but was removed when the radioactive danger grew greater? Yetthough the secret is no longer on Earth, it may be that if we can findEarth, we would be able to reason out the place where the secret hasbeen taken. If that were so, Earth's whereabouts would still have tobe hidden.&quot;Fallom's voice piped up again. &quot;Because if we can't find Earth,Bliss says you'll take me back to Jemby.&quot;Trevize turned toward Fallom and glared and Bliss said, in alow voice, &quot;I told you we might , Fallom. We'll talk aboutit later. Right now, go to your room and read, or play the flute, oranything else you want to do. Go go.&quot;Fallom, frowning sulkily, left the table.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;But how can you say that, Golan? Here we are. We'velocated Earth. Can we now deduce where whatever it is might be if itisn't on Earth?&quot;It took a moment for Trevize to get over the moment of ill humorFallom had induced. Then, he said, &quot;Why not? Imagine the radioactivity ofEarth's crust growing steadily worse. The population would be decreasingsteadily through death and emigration, and the secret, whatever it is,would be in increasing danger. Who would remain to protect it? Eventually,it would have to be shifted to another world, or the use of whateverit was would be lost to Earth. I suspect there would be reluctanceto move it and it is likely that it would be done more or less at thelast minute. Now, then, Janov, remember the old man on New Earth whofilled your ears with his version of Earth's history?&quot;<br>

&quot;Monolee?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. He. Did he not say in reference to the establishment of New Earththat what was left of Earth's population was brought to the planet?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Do you mean, old chap, that what we're searching foris now on New Earth? Brought there by the last of Earth's populationto leave?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Might that not be so? New Earth is scarcely betterknown to the Galaxy in general than Earth is, and the inhabitants aresuspiciously eager to keep all Outworlders away.&quot;<br>

&quot;We were there,&quot; put in Bliss. &quot;We didn't find anything.&quot;<br>

&quot;We weren't looking for anything but the whereabouts of Earth.&quot;Pelorat said, in a puzzled way, &quot;But we're looking for somethingwith a high technology; something that can remove information fromunder the nose of the Second Foundation itself, and even from under thenose excuse me, Bliss of Gaia. Those people on New Earth maybe able to control their patch of weather and may have some techniquesof biotechnology at their disposal, but I think you'll admit that theirlevel of technology is, on the whole, quite low.&quot;Bliss nodded. &quot;I agree with Pel.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;We're judging from very little. We never did see themen of the fishing fleet. We never saw any part of the island but thesmall patch we landed on. What might we have found if we had exploredmore thoroughly? After all, we didn't recognize the fluorescent lightstill we saw them in action, and if it appeared that the technology waslow, appeared , I say &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes?&quot; said Bliss, clearly unconvinced.
<br>&quot;That could be part of the veil intended to obscure the truth.&quot;<br>

&quot;Impossible,&quot; said Bliss.
<br>&quot;Impossible? It was you who told me, back on Gaia, that at Trantor,the larger civilization was deliberately held at a level of low technologyin order to hide the small kernel of Second Foundationers. Why mightnot the same strategy be used on New Earth?&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you suggest, then, that we return to New Earth and face infectionagain this time to have it activated? Sexual intercourse isundoubtedly a particularly pleasant mode of infection, but it may notbe the only one.&quot;Trevize shrugged. &quot;I am not eager to return to New Earth, but we mayhave to.&quot;<br>

&quot; May ?&quot;<br>

&quot;May! After all, there is another possibility.&quot;<br>

&quot;What is that?&quot;<br>

&quot;New Earth circles the star the people call Alpha. But Alpha is part ofa binary system. Might there not be a habitable planet circling Alpha'scompanion as well?&quot;<br>

&quot;Too dim, I should think,&quot; said Bliss, shaking her head. &quot;The companionis only a quarter as bright as Alpha is.&quot;<br>

&quot;Dim, but not too dim. If there is a planet fairly close to the star,it might do.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Does the computer say anything about any planets forthe companion?&quot;Trevize smiled grimly. &quot;I checked that. There are five planets ofmoderate size. No gas giants.&quot;<br>

&quot;And are any of the five planets habitable?&quot;<br>

&quot;The computer gives no information at all about the planets, otherthan their number, and the fact that they aren't large.&quot;<br>

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Pelorat deflated.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;That's nothing to be disappointed about. None of theSpacer worlds are to be found in the computer at all. The informationon Alpha itself is minimal. These things are hidden deliberately and ifalmost nothing is known about Alpha's companion, that might almost beregarded as a good sign.&quot;<br>

&quot;Then,&quot; said Bliss, in a business-like manner, &quot;what you are planningto do is this visit the companion and, if that draws a blank,return to Alpha itself.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. And this time when we reach the island of New Earth, we willbe prepared. We will examine the entire island meticulously beforelanding and, Bliss, I expect you to use your mental abilities toshield &quot;And at that moment, the Far Star lurched slightly, as thoughit had undergone a ship-sized hiccup, and Trevize cried out, halfwaybetween anger and perplexity, &quot;Who's at the controls?&quot;And even as he asked, he knew very well who was.
<br>95Fallom, at the computer console, was completelyabsorbed. Her small, long-fingered hands were stretched wide in order tofit the faintly gleaming handmarks on the desk. Fallom's hands seemedto sink into the material of the desk, even though it was clearly feltto be hard and slippery.
<br>She had seen Trevize hold his hands so on a number of occasions,and she hadn't seen him do more than that, though it was quite plain toher that in so doing he controlled the ship.
<br>On occasion, Fallom had seen Trevize close his eyes, and she closedhers now. After a moment or two, it was almost as though she hearda faint, far-off voice far off, but sounding in her own head,through (she dimly realized) her transducer-lobes. They were even moreimportant than her hands. She strained to make out the words.
<br>Instructions, it said, almost pleadingly. What are yourinstructions? Fallom didn't say anything. She had never witnessed Trevize sayinganything to the computer but she knew what it was that she wantedwith all her heart. She wanted to go back to Solaria, to the comfortingendlessness of the mansion, to Jemby&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by She wanted to go there and, as she thought of the world she loved,she imagined it visible on the viewscreen as she had seen other worldsshe didn't want. She opened her eyes and stared at the viewscreen willingsome other world there than this hateful Earth, then staring at what shesaw, imagining it to be Solaria. She hated the empty Galaxy to whichshe had been introduced against her will. Tears came to her eyes, andthe ship trembled.
<br>She could feel that tremble, and she swayed a little in response.
<br>And then she heard loud steps in the corridor outside and, when sheopened her eyes, Trevize's face, distorted, filled her vision, blockingout the viewscreen, which held all she wanted. He was shouting something,but she paid no attention. It was he who had taken her from Solaria bykilling Bander, and it was he who was preventing her from returning bythinking only of Earth, and she was not going to listen to him.
<br>She was going to take the ship to Solaria, and, with the intensityof her resolve, it trembled again.
<br>96Bliss clutched wildly at Trevize'sarm. &quot;Don't! Don't!&quot;She clung strongly, holding him back, while Pelorat stood, confusedand frozen, in the background.
<br>Trevize was shouting, &quot;Take your hands off the computer! Bliss,don't get in my way. I don't want to hurt you.&quot;Bliss said, in a tone that seemed almost exhausted, &quot;Don't offerviolence to the child. I'd have to hurt you&nbsp; againstall instructions.&quot;Trevize's eyes darted wildly from Fallom to Bliss. He said, &quot;Thenyou get her off, Bliss. Now!&quot;Bliss pushed him away with surprising strength (drawing it, Trevizethought afterward, from Gaia, perhaps).
<br>&quot;Fallom,&quot; she said, &quot;lift your hands.&quot;<br>

&quot;No,&quot; shrieked Fallom. &quot;I want the ship to go to Solaria. I want itto go there. There.&quot; She nodded toward the viewscreen with her head,unwilling to let even one hand release its pressure on the desk forthe purpose.
<br>But Bliss reached for the child's shoulders and, as her hands touchedFallom, the youngster began to tremble.
<br>Bliss's voice grew soft. &quot;Now, Fallom, tell the computer to be asit was and come with me. Come with me.&quot; Her hands stroked the child,who collapsed in an agony of weeping.
<br>Fallom's hands left the desk, and Bliss, catching her under thearmpits, lifted her into a standing position. She turned her, held herfirmly against her breast, and allowed the child to smother her wrenchingsobs there.
<br>Bliss said to Trevize, who was now standing dumbly in the doorway,&quot;Step out of the way, Trevize, and don't touch either of us as wepass.&quot;Trevize stepped quickly to one side.
<br>Bliss paused a moment, saying in a low voice to Trevize, &quot;I had to getinto her mind for a moment. If I've caused any damage, I won't forgiveyou easily.&quot;It was Trevize's impulse to tell her he didn't care a cubic millimeterof vacuum for Fallom's mind; that it was the computer for which hefeared. Against the concentrated glare of Gaia, however (surely it wasn'tonly Bliss whose sole expression could inspire the moment of cold terrorhe felt), he kept silent.
<br>He remained silent for a perceptible period, and motionless as well,after Bliss and Fallom had disappeared into their room. He remained so,in fact, until Pelorat said softly, &quot;Golan, are you all right? She didn'thurt you, did she?&quot;Trevize shook his head vigorously, as though to shake off the touchof paralysis that had afflicted him. &quot;I'm all right. The real questionis whether that's all right.&quot; He sat down at the computerconsole, his hands resting on the two handmarks which Fallom's handshad so recently covered.
<br>&quot;Well?&quot; said Pelorat anxiously.
<br>Trevize shrugged. &quot;It seems to respond normally. I might conceivablyfind something wrong later on, but there's nothing that seems offnow.&quot; Then, more angrily, &quot;The computer should not combine effectivelywith any hands other than mine, but in that hermaphrodite's case, itwasn't the hands alone. It was the transducer-lobes, I'm sure &quot;<br>

&quot;But what made the ship shake? It shouldn't do that, should it?&quot;<br>

&quot;No. It's a gravitic ship and we shouldn't have these inertialeffects. But that she-monster &quot; He paused, looking angry again.
<br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>

&quot;I suspect she faced the computer with two self-contradictory demands,and each with such force that the computer had no choice but to attemptto do both things at once. In the attempt to do the impossible, thecomputer must have released the inertia-free condition of the shipmomentarily. At least that's what I think happened.&quot;And then, somehow, his face smoothed out. &quot;And that might be agood thing, too, for it occurs to me now that all my talk about AlphaCentauri and its companion was flapdoodle. I know now where Earth musthave transferred its secret.&quot;97Pelorat stared, then ignored the final remark andwent back to an earlier puzzle. &quot;In what way did Fallom ask for twoself-contradictory things?&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, she said she wanted the ship to go to Solaria.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. Of course, she would.&quot;<br>

&quot;But what did she mean by Solaria? She can't recognize Solaria fromspace. She's never really seen it from space. She was asleep when weleft that world in a hurry. And despite her readings in your library,together with whatever Bliss has told her, I imagine she can't reallygrasp the truth of a Galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars and millionsof populated planets. Brought up, as she was, underground and alone,it is all she can do to grasp the bare concept that there are differentworlds but how many? Two? Three? Four? To her any world she seesis likely to be Solaria, and given the strength of her wishful thinking,is Solaria. And since I presume Bliss has tried to quiet her by hintingthat if we don't find Earth, we'll take her back to Solaria, she mayeven have worked up the notion that Solaria is close to Earth.&quot;<br>

&quot;But how can you tell this, Golan? What makes you think it's so?&quot;<br>

&quot;She as much as told us so, Janov, when we burst in upon her. She criedout that she wanted to go to Solaria and then added `there there,'
<br>nodding her head at the viewscreen. And what is on the viewscreen? Earth'ssatellite. It wasn't there when I left the machine before dinner; Earthwas. But Fallom must have pictured the satellite in her mind when sheasked for Solaria, and the computer, in response, must therefore havefocused on the satellite. Believe me, Janov, I know how this computerworks. Who would know better?&quot;Pelorat looked at the thick crescent of light on the viewscreen andsaid thoughtfully, &quot;It was called `moon' in at least one of Earth'slanguages; `Luna,' in another language. Probably many other names,too. Imagine the confusion, old chap, on a world with numerouslanguages the misunderstandings, the complications, the &quot;<br>

&quot;Moon?&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Well, that's simple enough. Then, too,come to think of it, it may be that the child tried, instinctively,to move the ship by means of its transducer-lobes, using the ship's ownenergy-source, and that may have helped produce the momentary inertialconfusion. But none of that matters, Janov. What does matter is thatall this has brought this moon yes, I like the name to thescreen and magnified it, and there it still is. I'm looking at it now,and wondering.&quot;<br>

&quot;Wondering what, Golan?&quot;<br>

&quot;At the size of it. We tend to ignore satellites, Janov. They'resuch little things, when they exist at all. This one is different,though. It's a world . It has a diameter of about thirty-fivehundred kilometers.&quot;<br>

&quot;A world? Surely you wouldn't call it a world. It can't behabitable. Even a thirty-five-hundred-kilometer diameter is too small. Ithas no atmosphere. I can tell that just looking at it. No clouds. Thecircular curve against space is sharp, so is the inner curve that boundsthe light and dark hemisphere.&quot;Trevize nodded, &quot;You're getting to be a seasoned space traveler,Janov. You're right. No air. No water. But that only means the moon'snot habitable on its unprotected surface. What about underground?&quot;<br>

&quot;Underground?&quot; said Pelorat doubtfully.
<br>&quot;Yes. Underground. Why not? Earth's cities were underground, you tellme. We know that Trantor was underground. Comporellon has much of itscapital city underground. The Solarian mansions were almost entirelyunderground. It's a very common state of affairs.&quot;<br>

&quot;But, Golan, in every one of these cases, people were living on ahabitable planet. The surface was habitable, too, with an atmosphereand with an ocean. Is it possible to live underground when the surfaceis uninhabitable??
<br>&quot;Come, Janov, think! Where are we living right now? The Far Star is a tiny world that has an uninhabitable surface. There's no air orwater on the outside. Yet we live inside in perfect comfort. The Galaxyis full of space stations and space settlements of infinite variety,to say nothing of spaceships, and they're all uninhabitable except forthe interior. Consider the moon a gigantic spaceship.&quot;<br>

&quot;With a crew inside?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. Millions of people, for all we know; and plants and animals;and an advanced technology. Look, Janov, doesn't it make sense? IfEarth, in its last days, could send out a party of Settlers to a planetorbiting Alpha Centauri; and if, possibly with Imperial help, they couldattempt to terraform it, seed its oceans, build dry land where there wasnone; could Earth not also send a party to its satellite and terraformits interior?&quot;Pelorat said reluctantly, &quot;I suppose so.&quot;<br>

&quot;It would be done. If Earth has something to hide,why send it over a parsec away, when it could be hidden on a world lessthan a hundred millionth the distance to Alpha. And the moon would be amore efficient hiding place from the psychological standpoint. No onewould think of satellites in connection with life. For that matter Ididn't. With the moon an inch before my nose, my thoughts went haringoff to Alpha. If it hadn't been for Fallom &quot; His lips tightened,and he shook his head. &quot;I suppose I'll have to credit her for that. Blisssurely will if I don't.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;But see here, old man, if there's something hidingunder the surface of the moon, how do we find it? There must be millionsof square kilometers of surface &quot;<br>

&quot;Roughly forty million.&quot;<br>

&quot;And we would have to inspect all of that, looking for what? Anopening? Some sort of airlock?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Put that way, it would seem rather a task, but we'renot just looking for objects, we're looking for life; and for intelligentlife at that. And we've got Bliss, and detecting intelligence is hertalent, isn't it?&quot;98Bliss looked at Trevize accusingly. &quot;I've finally got herto sleep. I had the hardest time. She was wild . Fortunately,I don't think I've damaged her.&quot;Trevize said coldly, &quot;You might try removing her fixation on Jemby,you know, since I certainly have no intention of ever going back toSolaria.&quot;<br>

&quot;Just remove her fixation, is that it? What do you know about suchthings, Trevize? You've never sensed a mind. You haven't the faintestidea of its complexity. If you knew anything at all about it, you wouldn'ttalk about removing a fixation as though it were just a matter of scoopingjam out of a jar.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, weaken it at least.&quot;<br>

&quot;I might weaken it a bit, after a month of careful dethreading.&quot;<br>

&quot;What do you mean, dethreading?&quot;<br>

&quot;To someone who doesn't know, it can't be explained.&quot;<br>

&quot;What are you going to do with the child, then?&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know yet; it will take a lot of consideration.&quot;<br>

&quot;In that case,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;let me tell you what we're going todo with the ship.&quot;<br>

&quot;I know what you're going to do. It's back to New Earth and another tryat the lovely Hiroko, if she'll promise not to infect you this time.&quot;Trevize kept his face expressionless. He said, &quot;No, as a matter offact. I've changed my mind. We're going to the moon which is thename of the satellite, according to Janov.&quot;<br>

&quot;The satellite? Because it's the nearest world at hand? I hadn'tthought of that.&quot;<br>

&quot;Nor I. Nor would anyone have thought of it. Nowhere in the Galaxyis there a satellite worth thinking about but this satellite,in being large, is unique. What's more, Earth's anonymity covers it aswell. Anyone who can't find the Earth can't find the moon, either.&quot;<br>

&quot;Is it habitable?&quot;<br>

&quot;Not on the surface, but it is not radioactive, not at all, so itisn't absolutely uninhabitable. It may have life it may be teemingwith life, in fact under the surface. And, of course, you'll beable to tell if that's so, once we get close enough.&quot;Bliss shrugged. &quot;I'll try. But, then, what made you suddenlythink of trying the satellite?&quot;Trevize said quietly, &quot;Something Fallom did when she was at thecontrols.&quot;Bliss waited, as though expecting more, then shrugged again. &quot;Whateverit was, I suspect you wouldn't have gotten the inspiration if you hadfollowed your own impulse and killed her.&quot;<br>

&quot;I had no intention of killing her, Bliss.&quot;Bliss waved her hand. &quot;All right. Let it be. Are we moving towardthe moon now?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes. As a matter of caution, I'm not going too fast, but if all goeswell, we'll be in its vicinity in thirty hours.&quot;99The moon was a wasteland. Trevize watched the brightdaylit portion drifting past them below. It was a monotonous panoramaof crater rings and mountainous areas, and of shadows black against thesunlight. There were subtle color changes in the soil and occasionalsizable stretches of flatness, broken by small craters.
<br>As they approached the nightside, the shadows grew longer and finallyfused together. For a while, behind them, peaks glittered in the sun,like fat stars, far outshining their brethren in the sky. Then theydisappeared and below was only the fainter light of the Earth in thesky, a large bluish-white sphere, a little more than half full. The shipfinally outran the Earth, too, which sank beneath the horizon so thatunder them was unrelieved blackness, and above only the faint powderingof stars, which, to Trevize, who had been brought up on the starlessworld of Terminus, was always miracle enough.
<br>Then, new bright stars appeared ahead, first just one or two, thenothers, expanding and thickening and finally coalescing. And at once theypassed the terminator into the daylit side. The sun rose with infernalsplendor, while the viewscreen shifted away from it at once and polarizedthe glare of the ground beneath.
<br>Trevize could see quite well that it was useless to hope to find anyway into the inhabited interior (if that existed) by mere eye inspectionof this perfectly enormous world.
<br>He turned to look at Bliss, who sat beside him. She did not look atthe viewscreen; indeed, she kept her eyes closed. She seemed to havecollapsed into the chair rather than to be sitting in it.
<br>Trevize, wondering if she were asleep, said softly, &quot;Do you detectanything else?&quot;Bliss shook her head very slightly. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered. &quot;There wasjust that faint whiff. You'd better take me back there. Do you knowwhere that region was?&quot;<br>

&quot;The computer knows.&quot;It was like zeroing in on a target, shifting this way and that and thenfinding it. The area in question was still deep in the nightside and,except that the Earth shone fairly low in the sky and gave the surfacea ghostly ashen glow between the shadows, there was nothing to make out,even though the light in the pilot-room had been blacked out for betterviewing.
<br>Pelorat had approached and was standing anxiously in the doorway. &quot;Havewe found anything?&quot; he asked, in a husky whisper.
<br>Trevize held up his hand for silence. He was watching Bliss. He knewit would be days before sunlight would return to this spot on the moon,but he also knew that for what Bliss was trying to sense, light of anykind was irrelevant.
<br>She said, &quot;It's there.&quot;<br>

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>

&quot;And it's the only spot?&quot;<br>

&quot;It's the only spot I've detected. Have you been over every part ofthe moon's surface?&quot;<br>

&quot;We've been over a respectable fraction of it.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, then, in that respectable fraction, this is all I havedetected. It's stronger now, as though it has detectedus and it doesn't seem dangerous. The feeling I get is awelcoming one.&quot;<br>

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br>

&quot;It's the feeling I get.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Could it be faking the feeling?&quot;Bliss said, with a trace of hauteur, &quot;I would detect a fake, I assureyou.&quot;Trevize muttered something about overconfidence, then said, &quot;Whatyou detect is intelligence, I hope.&quot;<br>

&quot;I detect strong intelligence. Except &quot; And an odd note enteredher voice.
<br>&quot;Except what?&quot;<br>

&quot;Ssh. Don't disturb me. Let me concentrate.&quot; The last word was a meremotion of her lips.
<br>Then she said, in faint elated surprise, &quot;It's not human.&quot;<br>

&quot;Not human,&quot; said Trevize, in much stronger surprise. &quot;Are we dealingwith robots again? As on Solaria?&quot;<br>

&quot;No.&quot; Bliss was smiling. &quot;It's not quite robotic, either.&quot;<br>

&quot;It has to be one or the other.&quot;<br>

&quot;Neither.&quot; She actually chuckled. &quot;It's not human, and yet it's notlike any robot I've detected before.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I would like to see that.&quot; He nodded his headvigorously, his eyes wide with pleasure. &quot;It would be exciting. Somethingnew.&quot;<br>

&quot;Something new,&quot; muttered Trevize with a sudden lift of his ownspirits and a flash of unexpected insight seemed to illuminatethe interior of his skull.
<br>100Down they sank to the moon's surface, in what was almostjubilation. Even Fallom had joined them now and, with the abandonmentof a youngster, was hugging herself with unbearable joy as though shewere truly returning to Solaria.
<br>As for Trevize, he felt within himself a touch of sanity tellinghim that it was strange that Earth or whatever of Earth was onthe moon which had taken such measures to keep off all others,should now be taking measures to draw them in. Could the purpose be thesame in either way? Was it a case of &quot;If you can't make them avoid you,draw them in and destroy them?&quot; Either way, would not Earth's secretremain untouched?
<br>But that thought faded and drowned in the flood of joy that deepenedsteadily as they came closer to the moon's surface. Yet over and beyondthat, he managed to cling to the moment of illumination that had reachedhim just before they had begun their gliding dive to the surface of theEarth's satellite.
<br>He seemed to have no doubt as to where the ship was going. Theywere just above the tops of the rolling hills now, and Trevize, atthe computer, felt no need to do anything. It was as though he and thecomputer, both, were being guided, and he felt only an enormous euphoriaat having the weight of responsibility taken away from him.
<br>They were sliding parallel to the ground, toward a cliff that raisedits menacing height as a barrier against them; a barrier glisteningfaintly in Earth-shine and in the light-beam of the Far Star . Theapproach of certain collision seemed to mean nothing to Trevize, and itwas with no surprise whatever that he became aware that the section ofcliff directly ahead had fallen away and that a corridor, gleaming inartificial light, had opened before them.
<br>The ship slowed to a crawl, apparently of its own accord, and fittedneatly into the opening entering sliding along Theopening closed behind it, and another then opened before it. Throughthe second opening went the ship, into a gigantic hall that seemed thehollowed interior of a mountain.
<br>The ship halted and all aboard rushed to the airlock eagerly. Itoccurred to none of them, not even to Trevize, to check. whether theremight be a breathable atmosphere outside or any atmosphere atall.
<br>There was air, however. It was breathable and it wascomfortable. They looked about themselves with the pleased air of peoplewho had somehow come home and it was only after a while that they becameaware of a man who was waiting politely for them to approach.
<br>He was tall, and his expression was grave. His hair was bronze incolor, and cut short. His cheekbones were broad, his eyes were bright,and his clothing was rather after the fashion one saw in ancient historybooks. Although he seemed sturdy and vigorous there was, just the same,an air of weariness about him not in anything that one could see,but rather in something appealing to no recognizable sense.
<br>It was Fallom who reacted first. With a loud, whistling scream, sheran toward the man, waving her arms and crying, &quot;Jemby! Jemby!&quot; in abreathless fashion.
<br>She never slackened her pace, and when she was close enough, the manstooped and lifted her high in the air. She threw her arms about his neck,sobbing, and still gasping, &quot;Jemby!&quot;The others approached more soberly and Trevize said, slowly anddistinctly (could this man understand Galactic?), &quot;We ask pardon,sir. This child has lost her protector and is searching for itdesperately. How it came to fasten on you is a puzzle to us, since itis seeking a robot; a mechanical &quot;The man spoke for the first time. His voice was utilitarian ratherthan musical, and there was a faint air of archaism clinging to it,but he spoke Galactic with perfect ease.
<br>&quot;I greet you all in friendship,&quot; he said and he seemedunmistakably friendly, even though his face continued to remain fixed inits expression of gravity. &quot;As for this child,&quot; he went on, &quot;she showsperhaps a greater perceptivity than you think, for I am a robot. My nameis Daneel Olivaw.&quot;

   101Trevize found himself in a complete state ofdisbelief. He had recovered from the odd euphoria he had felt just beforeand after the landing on the moon a euphoria, he now suspected,that had been imposed on him by this self-styled robot who now stoodbefore him.
<br>Trevize was still staring, and in his now perfectly sane and untouchedmind, he remained lost in astonishment. He had talked in astonishment,made conversation in astonishment, scarcely understood what he said orheard as he searched for something in the appearance of this apparent man,in his behavior, in his manner of speaking, that bespoke the robot.
<br>No wonder, thought Trevize, that Bliss had detected somethingthat was neither human nor robot, but, that was, in Pelorat's words,&quot;something new.&quot; Just as well, of course, for it had turned Trevize'sthoughts into another and more enlightening channel but even thatwas now crowded into the back of his mind.
<br>Bliss and Fallom had wandered off to explore the grounds. It hadbeen Bliss's suggestion, but it seemed to Trevize that it came after alightning-quick glance had been exchanged between herself and Daneel. WhenFallom refused and asked to stay with the being she persisted in callingJemby, a grave word from Daneel and a lift of the finger was enough tocause her to trot off at once. Trevize and Pelorat remained.
<br>&quot;They are not Foundationers, sirs,&quot; said the robot, as though thatexplained it all. &quot;One is Gaia and one is a Spacer.&quot;Trevize remained silent while they were led to simply designed chairsunder a tree. They seated themselves, at a gesture from the robot,and when he sat down, too, in a perfectly human movement, Trevize said,&quot;Are you truly a robot?&quot;<br>

&quot;Truly, sir,&quot; said Daneel.
<br>Pelorat's face seemed to shine with joy. He said, &quot;There arereferences to a robot named Daneel in the old legends. Are you named inhis honor?&quot;<br>

&quot;I am that robot,&quot; said Daneel. &quot;It is not a legend.&quot;<br>

&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;If you are that robot, you would have to bethousands of years old.&quot;<br>

&quot;Twenty thousand,&quot; said Daneel quietly.
<br>Pelorat seemed abashed at that, and glanced at Trevize, who said,with a touch of anger, &quot;If you are a robot, I order you to speaktruthfully.&quot;<br>

&quot;I do not need to be told to speak truthfully, sir. I must do so. You are faced then, sir, with three alternatives. Either I ama man who is lying to you; or I am a robot who has been programmed tobelieve that it is twenty thousand years old but, in fact, is not; orI am a robot who is twenty thousand years old. You mustdecide which alternative to accept.&quot;<br>

&quot;The matter may decide itself with continued conversation,&quot; saidTrevize dryly. &quot;For that matter, it is hard to believe that this isthe interior of the moon. Neither the light&quot; he looked up as hesaid that, for the light was precisely that of soft, diffuse sunlight,though no sun was in the sky, and, for that matter, no sky was clearlyvisible &quot;nor the gravity seems credible. This world should havea surface gravity of less than 0.2g.&quot;<br>

&quot;The normal surface gravity would be 0.16g actually, sir. It isbuilt up, however, by the same forces that give you, on your ship, thesensation of normal gravity, even when you are in free fall, or underacceleration. Other energy needs, including the light, are also metgravitically, though we use solar energy where that is convenient. Ourmaterial needs are all supplied by the moon's soil, except for the lightelements hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen which the moon doesnot possess. We obtain those by capturing an occasional comet. One suchcapture a century is more than enough to supply our needs.&quot;<br>

&quot;I take it Earth is useless as a source of supply.&quot;<br>

&quot;Unfortunately, that is so, sir. Our positronic brains are as sensitiveto radioactivity as human proteins are.&quot;<br>

&quot;You use the plural, and this mansion before us seems, large,beautiful, and elaborate at least as seen from the outside. Thereare then other beings on the moon. Humans? Robots?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, sir. We have a complete ecology on the moon and a vast andcomplex hollow within which that ecology exists. The intelligent beingsare all robots, however, more or less like myself. You will see none ofthem, however. As for this mansion, it is used by myself only and it isan establishment that is modeled exactly on one I used to live in twentythousand years ago.&quot;<br>

&quot;Which you remember in detail, do you?&quot; .
<br>&quot;Perfectly, sir. I was manufactured, and existed for a time howbrief a time it seems to me, now on the Spacer world of Aurora.&quot;<br>

&quot;The one with the &quot; Trevize paused.
<br>&quot;Yes, sir. The one with the dogs.&quot;<br>

&quot;You know about that?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>

&quot;How do you come to be here, then, if you lived at first onAurora?&quot;<br>

&quot;Sir, it was to prevent the creation of a radioactive Earth that Icame here in the very beginnings of the settlement of the Galaxy. Therewas another robot with me, named Giskard, who could sense and adjustminds.&quot;<br>

&quot;As Bliss can?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, sir. We failed, in a way, and Giskard ceased to operate. Beforethe cessation, however, he made it possible for me to have his talentand left it to me to care for the Galaxy; for Earth, particularly.&quot;<br>

&quot;Why Earth, particularly?&quot;<br>

&quot;In part because of a man named Elijah Baley, an Earthman.&quot;Pelorat put in excitedly, &quot;He is the culture-hero I mentioned sometime ago, Golan.&quot;<br>

&quot;A culture-hero, sir?&quot;<br>

&quot;What Dr. Pelorat means,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;is that he is a person towhom much was attributed, and who may have been an amalgamation of manymen in actual history, or who may be an invented person altogether.&quot;Daneel considered for a moment, and then said, quite calmly, &quot;Thatis not so, sirs. Elijah Baley was a real man and he was one man. I donot know what your legends say of him, but in actual history, the Galaxymight never have been settled without him. In his honor, I did my bestto salvage what I could of Earth after it began to turn radioactive. Myfellow-robots were distributed over the Galaxy in an effort to influence aperson here a person there. At one time I maneuvered a beginning tothe recycling of Earth's soil. At another much later time, I maneuvereda beginning to the terraforming of a world circling the nearby star,now called Alpha. In neither case was I truly successful. I could neveradjust human minds entirely as I wished, for there was always the chancethat I might do harm to the various humans who were adjusted. I was bound,you see and am bound to this day by the Laws of Robotics.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes?&quot;It did not necessarily take a being with Daneel's mental power todetect uncertainty in that monosyllable.
<br>&quot;The First Law,&quot; he said, &quot;is this, sir: `A robot may not injurea human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come toharm.' The Second Law: `A robot must obey the orders given it byhuman beings except where such orders would conflict with the FirstLaw.' The Third Law: `A robot must protect its own existence, aslong as such protection does not conflict with the First or SecondLaw.' Naturally, I give you these laws in the approximationof language. In actual fact they represent complicated mathematicalconfigurations of our positronic brain-paths.&quot;<br>

&quot;Do you find it difficult to deal with those Laws?&quot;<br>

&quot;I must, sir. The First Law is an absolute that almost forbids the useof my mental talents altogether. When dealing with the Galaxy it is notlikely that any course of action will prevent harm altogether. Always,some people, perhaps many people, will suffer so that a robot must chooseminimum harm. Yet, the complexity of possibilities is such that it takestime to make that choice and one is, even then, never certain.&quot;<br>

&quot;I see that,&quot; said Trevize.
<br>&quot;All through Galactic history,&quot; said Daneel, &quot;I tried to amelioratethe worst aspects of the strife and disaster that perpetually madeitself felt in the Galaxy. I may have succeeded, on occasion, and tosome extent, but if you know your Galactic history, you will know thatI did not succeed often, or by much.&quot;<br>

&quot;That much I know,&quot; said Trevize, with a wry smile.
<br>&quot;Just before Giskard's end, he conceived of a robotic law thatsuperseded even the first. We called it the `Zeroth Law' out of aninability to think of any other name that made sense. The Zeroth Law is:
<br>`A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanityto come to harm.' This automatically means that the First Law mustbe modified to be: `A robot may not injure a human being, or, throughinaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that wouldconflict with the Zeroth Law.' And similar modifications must be madein the Second and Third Laws.&quot;Trevize frowned. &quot;How do you decide what is injurious, or notinjurious, to humanity as a whole?&quot;<br>

&quot;Precisely, sir,&quot; said Daneel. &quot;In theory, the Zeroth Law was theanswer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A humanbeing is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated andjudged. Humanity is an abstraction. How do we deal with it?&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Trevize.
<br>&quot;Wait,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;You could convert humanity into a singleorganism. Gaia.&quot;<br>

&quot;That is what I tried to do, sir. I engineered the founding ofGaia. If humanity could be made a single organism, it would becomea concrete object, and it could be dealt with. It was, however, notas easy to create a superorganism as I had hoped. In the first place,it could not be done unless human beings valued the superorganism morethan their individuality, and I had to find a mind-cast that would allowthat. It was a long time before I thought of the Laws of Robotics.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah, then, the Gaians are robots. I had suspected thatfrom the start.&quot;<br>

&quot;In that case, you suspected incorrectly, sir. They are humanbeings, but they have brains firmly inculcated with the equivalentof the Laws of Robotics. They have to value life, really value it. And even after that was done, there remained a seriousflaw. A superorganism consisting of human beings only is unstable. Itcannot be set up. Other animals must be added then plants thenthe inorganic world. The smallest superorganism that is truly stable isan entire world, and a world large enough and complex enough to have astable ecology. It took a long time to understand this, and it is only inthis last century that Gaia was fully established and thatit became ready to move on toward Galaxia and, even so, that willtake a long time, too. Perhaps not as long as the road already traveled,however, since we now know the rules.&quot;<br>

&quot;But you needed me to make the decision for you. Is that it,Daneel?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, sir. The Laws of Robotics would not allow me, nor Gaia, to makethe decision and chance harm to humanity. And meanwhile, five centuriesago, when it seemed that I would never work out methods for gettinground all the difficulties that stood in the way of establishing Gaia,I turned to the second-best and helped bring about the development ofthe science of psychohistory.&quot;<br>

&quot;I might have guessed that,&quot; mumbled Trevize. &quot;You know, Daneel, I'mbeginning to believe you are twenty thousand years old.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Wait a while. I think I see something. Are you partof Gaia yourself, Daneel? Would that be how you knew about the dogs onAurora? Through Bliss?&quot;Daneel said, &quot;In a way, sir, you are correct. I am associated withGaia, though I am not part of it.&quot;Trevize's eyebrows went up. &quot;That sounds like Comporellon, the worldwe visited immediately after leaving Gaia. It insists it is not part ofthe Foundation Confederation, but is only associated with it.&quot;Slowly, Daneel nodded. &quot;I suppose that analogy is apt, sir. Ican, as an associate of Gaia, make myself aware of what Gaia is awareof in the person of the woman, Bliss, for instance. Gaia, however,cannot make itself aware of what I am aware of, so that I maintain myfreedom of action. That freedom of action is necessary until Galaxia iswell established.&quot;Trevize looked steadily at the robot for a moment, then said, &quot;Anddid you use your awareness through Bliss in order to interfere withevents on our journey to mold them to your better liking?&quot;Daneel sighed in a curiously human fashion. &quot;I could not do much,sir. The Laws of Robotics always hold me back. And yet, I lightenedthe load on Bliss's mind, taking a small amount of added responsibility onmyself, so that she might deal with the wolves of Aurora and the Spacer onSolaria with greater dispatch and with less harm to herself. In addition,I influenced the woman on Comporellon and the one on New Earth, throughBliss, in order to have them look with favor on you, so that you mightcontinue on your journey.&quot;Trevize smiled, half-sadly. &quot;I ought to have known it wasn't I.&quot;Daneel accepted the statement without its rueful self-deprecation. &quot;Onthe contrary, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;it was you in considerable part. Each of thetwo women looked with favor upon you from the start. I merely strengthenedthe impulse already present about all one can safely do under thestrictures of the Laws of Robotics. Because of those strictures andfor other reasons as well it was only with great difficulty that Ibrought you here, and only indirectly. I was in great danger at severalpoints of losing you.&quot;<br>

&quot;And now I am here,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;What is it you wantof me? To confirm my decision in favor of Galaxia?&quot;Daneel's face, always expressionless, somehow managed to seemdespairing. &quot;No, sir. The mere decision is no longer enough. I broughtyou here, as best I could in my present condition, for something farmore desperate. I am dying.&quot;102Perhaps it was because of the matter-of-fact way in whichDaneel said it; or perhaps because a lifetime of twenty thousand yearsmade death seem no tragedy to one doomed to live less than half a percentof that period; but, in any case, Trevize felt no stir of sympathy.
<br>&quot;Die? Can a machine die?&quot;<br>

&quot;I can cease to exist, sir. Call it by whatever word you wish. Iam old. Not one sentient being in the Galaxy that was alive when Iwas first given consciousness is still alive today; nothing organic;nothing robotic. Even I myself lack continuity.&quot;<br>

&quot;In what way?&quot;<br>

&quot;There is no physical part of my body, sir, that has escapedreplacement, not only once but many times. Even my positronic brain hasbeen replaced on five different occasions. Each time the contents of myearlier brain were etched into the newer one to the last positron. Eachtime, the new brain had a greater capacity and complexity than the old,so that there was room for more memories, and for faster decision andaction. But &quot;<br>

&quot;But?&quot;<br>

&quot;The more advanced and complex the brain, the more unstable it is,and the more quickly it deteriorates. My present brain is a hundredthousand times as sensitive as my first, and has ten million timesthe capacity; but whereas my first brain endured for over ten thousandyears, the present one is but six hundred years old and is unmistakablysenescent. With every memory of twenty thousand years perfectlyrecorded and with a perfect recall mechanism in place, the brain isfilled. There is a rapidly declining ability to reach decisions; an evenmore rapidly declining ability to test and influence minds at hyperspatialdistances. Nor can I design a sixth brain. Further miniaturization willrun against the blank wall of the uncertainty principle, and furthercomplexity will but assure decay almost at once.&quot;Pelorat seemed desperately troubled. &quot;But surely, Daneel, Gaiacan carry on without you. Now that Trevize has judged and selectedGalaxia &quot;<br>

&quot;The process simply took too long, sir,&quot; said Daneel, as alwaysbetraying no emotion. &quot;I had to wait for Gaia to be fully established,despite the unanticipated difficulties that arose. By the time a humanbeing Mr. Trevize was located who was capable of makingthe key decision, it was too late. Do not think, however, that I tookno measure to lengthen my life span. Little by little I have reducedmy activities, in order to conserve what I could for emergencies. WhenI could no longer rely on active measures to preserve the isolation ofthe Earth/moon system, I adopted passive ones. Over a period of years,the humaniform robots that have been working with me have been, one byone, called home. Their last tasks have been to remove all references toEarth in the planetary archives. And without myself and my fellow-robotsin full play, Gaia will lack the essential tools to carry through thedevelopment of Galaxia in less than an inordinate period of time.&quot;<br>

&quot;And you knew all this,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;when I made my decision?&quot;<br>

&quot;A substantial time before, sir,&quot; said Daneel. &quot;Gaia, of course,did not know.&quot;<br>

&quot;But then,&quot; said Trevize angrily, &quot;what was the use of carryingthrough the charade? What good has it been? Ever since my decision, Ihave scoured the Galaxy, searching for Earth and what I thought of as its`secret' not knowing the secret was you in order that I mightconfirm the decision. Well, I have confirmed it. I know now that Galaxiais absolutely essential and it appears to be all for nothing. Whycould you not have left the Galaxy to itself and me to myself?&quot;Daneel said, &quot;Because, sir, I have been searching for a way out,and I have been carrying on in the hope that I might find one. I thinkI have. Instead of replacing my brain with yet another positronic one,which is impractical, I might merge it with a human brain instead; ahuman brain that is not affected by the Three Laws, and will not onlyadd capacity to my brain, but add a whole new level of abilities aswell. That is why I have brought you here.&quot;Trevize looked appalled. &quot;You mean you plan to merge a human braininto yours? Have the human brain lose its individuality so that you canachieve a two-brain Gaia?&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, sir. It would not make me immortal, but it might enable me tolive long enough to establish Galaxia.&quot;<br>

&quot;And you brought me here for that? You want myindependence of the Three Laws and my sense of judgment made part ofyou at the price of my individuality? No!&quot;Daneel said, &quot;Yet you said a moment ago that Galaxia is essentialfor the welfare of the human &quot;<br>

&quot;Even if it is, it would take a long time to establish, and I wouldremain an individual in my lifetime. On the other hand, if it wereestablished rapidly, there would be a Galactic loss of individualityand my own loss would be part of an unimaginably greater whole. I would,however, certainly never consent to lose my individuality while the restof the Galaxy retains theirs.&quot;Daneel said, &quot;It is, then, as I thought. Your brain would not mergewell and, in any case, it would serve a better purpose if you retainedan independent judgmental ability.&quot;<br>

&quot;When did you change your mind? You said that it was for merging thatyou brought me here.&quot;<br>

&quot;Yes, and only by using the fullest extent of my greatly diminishedpowers. Still, when I said, `That is why I have brought you here,'
<br>please remember that in Galactic Standard, the word `you' representsthe plural as well as the singular. I was referring to all of you.&quot;Pelorat stiffened in his seat. &quot;Indeed? Tell me then, Daneel,would a human brain that was merged with your brain share in all yourmemories all twenty thousand years of it, back to legendarytimes?&quot;<br>

&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;Pelorat drew a long breath. &quot;That would fulfill a lifetime search,and it is something I would gladly give up my individuality for. Pleaselet me have the privilege of sharing your brain.&quot;Trevize asked softly, &quot;And Bliss? What about her?&quot;Pelorat hesitated for no more than a moment. &quot;Bliss will understand,&quot;he said. &quot;She will, in any case, be better off without me aftera while.&quot;Daneel shook his head. &quot;Your offer, Dr. Pelorat, is a generous one,but I cannot accept it. Your brain is an old one and it cannot survivefor more than two or three decades at best, even in a merger with myown. I need something else. See!&quot; He pointed and said, &quot;I've calledher back.&quot;Bliss was returning, walking happily, with a bounce to her steps.
<br>Pelorat rose convulsively to his feet. &quot;Bliss! Oh no!&quot;<br>

&quot;Do not be alarmed, Dr. Pelorat,&quot; said Daneel. &quot;I cannot useBliss. That would merge me with Gaia, and I must remain independent ofGaia, as I have already explained.&quot;<br>

&quot;But in that case,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;who &quot;And Trevize, looking at the slim figure running after Bliss, said,&quot;The robot has wanted Fallom all along, Janov.&quot;103Bliss returned, smiling, clearly in a state of greatpleasure.
<br>&quot;We couldn't pass beyond the bounds of the estate,&quot; she said,&quot;but it all reminded me very much of Solaria. Fallom, of course, isconvinced it is Solaria. I asked her if she didn't think that Daneelhad an appearance different from that of Jemby after all, Jembywas metallic and Fallom said, `No, not really.' I don't know whatshe meant by `not really.'&quot;She looked across to the middle distance where Fallom was now playingher flute for a grave Daneel, whose head nodded in time. The soundreached them, thin, clear, and lovely.
<br>&quot;Did you know she took the flute with her when we left the ship?&quot; askedBliss. &quot;I suspect we won't be able to get her away from Daneel for quitea while.&quot;The remark was met with a heavy silence, and Bliss looked at the twomen in quick alarm. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;Trevize gestured gently in Pelorat's direction. It was up to him,the gesture seemed to say.
<br>Pelorat cleared his throat and said, &quot;Actually, Bliss, I think thatFallom will be staying with Daneel permanently.&quot;<br>

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Bliss, frowning, made as though to walk in Daneel'sdirection, but Pelorat caught her arm. &quot;Bliss dear, you can't. He's morepowerful than Gaia even now, and Fallom must stay with him if Galaxia isto come into existence. Let me explain and, Golan, please correctme if I get anything wrong.&quot;Bliss listened to the account, her expression sinking into somethingclose to despair.
<br>Trevize said, in an attempt at cool reason, &quot;You see how it is,Bliss. The child is a Spacer and Daneel was designed and put togetherby Spacers. The child was brought up by a robot and knew nothing elseon an estate as empty as this one. The child has transductive powerswhich Daneel will need, and she will live for three or four centuries,which may be what is required for the construction of Galaxia.&quot;Bliss said, her cheeks flushed and her eyes moist, &quot;I suppose thatthe robot maneuvered our trip to Earth in such a way as to make us passthrough Solaria in order to pick up a child for his use.&quot;Trevize shrugged. &quot;He may simply have taken advantage of theopportunity. I don't think his powers are strong enough at the momentto make complete puppets of us at hyperspatial distances.&quot;<br>

&quot;No. It was purposeful. He made certain that I would feel stronglyattracted to the child so that I would take her with me, rather thanleave her to be killed; that I would protect her even against you whenyou showed nothing but resentment and annoyance at her being with us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;That might just as easily have been your Gaian ethics,which Daneel could have strengthened a bit, I suppose. Come, Bliss,there's nothing to be gained. Suppose you could take Fallomaway. Where could you then take her that would make her as happy as sheis here? Would you take her back to Solaria where she would be killedquite pitilessly; to some crowded world where she would sicken and die;to Gaia, where she would wear her heart out longing for Jemby; on anendless voyage through the Galaxy, where she would think that everyworld we came across was her Solaria? And would you find a substitutefor Daneel's use so that Galaxia could be constructed?&quot;Bliss was sadly silent.
<br>Pelorat held out his hand to her, a bit timidly. &quot;Bliss,&quot; he said,&quot;I volunteered to have my brain fused with Daneel's. He wouldn't take itbecause he said I was too old. I wish he had, if that would have savedFallom for you.&quot;Bliss took his hand and kissed it. &quot;Thank you, Pel, but the pricewould be too high, even for Fallom.&quot; She took a deep breath, and triedto smile. &quot;Perhaps, when we get back to Gaia, room will be found in theglobal organism for a child for me and I will place Fallom in thesyllables of its name.&quot;And now Daneel, as though aware that the matter was settled, waswalking toward them, with Fallom skipping along at his side.
<br>The youngster broke into a run and reached them first. She said toBliss, &quot;Thank you, Bliss, for taking me home to Jemby again and for takingcare of me while weeeere on the ship. I shall always remember you.&quot; Thenshe flung herself at Bliss and the two held each other tightly.
<br>&quot;I hope you will always be happy,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;I will remember you,too, Fallom dear,&quot; and released her with reluctance.
<br>Fallom turned to Pelorat, and said, &quot;Thank you, too, Pel, for lettingme read your book-films.&quot; Then, without an additional word, and after atrace of hesitation, the thin, girlish hand was extended to Trevize. Hetook it for a moment, then let it go.
<br>&quot;Good luck, Fallom,&quot; he muttered.
<br>Daneel said, &quot;I thank you all, sirs and madam, for what you havedone, each in your own way. You are free to go now, for your searchis ended. As for my own work, it will be ended, too, soon enough, andsuccessfully now.&quot;But Bliss said, &quot;Wait, weeare not quite through. We don't know yetwhether Trevize is still of the mind that the proper future for humanityis Galaxia, as opposed to a vast conglomeration of Isolates.&quot;Daneel said, &quot;He has already made that clear a while ago, madam. Hehas decided in favor of Galaxia.&quot;Bliss's lips tightened. &quot;I'd rather hear that from him. Whichis it to be, Trevize?&quot;Trevize said calmly, &quot;Which do you want it to be, Bliss? If I decideagainst Galaxia, you may get Fallom back.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I am Gaia. I must know your decision, and its reason,for the sake of the truth and nothing else.&quot;Daneel said, &quot;Tell her, sir. Your mind, as Gaia is aware, isuntouched.&quot;And Trevize said, &quot;The decision is for Galaxia. There is no furtherdoubt in my mind on that point.&quot;104Bliss remained motionless for the time one might taketo count to fifty at a moderate rate, as though sheeeere allowing theinformation to reach all parts of Gaia, and then sheesaid, &quot;Why?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Listen to me. I knew from the start that there eere twopossible futures for humanity Galaxia, or else the Second Empire ofSeldon's Plan. And it seemed to me that those two possible futures eeremutually exclusive. We couldn't have Galaxia unless, for some reason,Seldon's Plan had some fundamental flaw in it.
<br>&quot;Unfortunately, I knew nothing about Seldon's Plan except for the twoaxioms on which it is based: one, that there be involved a large enoughnumber of human beings to allow humanity to be treated statistically asa group of individuals interacting randomly; and second, that humanitynot know the results of psychohistorical conclusions before the resultsare achieved.
<br>&quot;Since I had already decided in favor of Galaxia, I felt I must besubliminally aware of flaws in Seldon's Plan, and those flaws could onlybe in the axioms, which eere all I knew of the plan. Yet I could seenothing wrong with the axioms. I strove, then, to find Earth, feelingthat Earth could not be so thoroughly hidden for no purpose. I had tofind out what that purpose was.
<br>&quot;I had no real reason to expect to find a solution once I found Earth,but I was desperate and could think of nothing else to do. Andperhaps Daneel's desire for a Solarian child helped drive me.
<br>&quot;In any case, we finally reached Earth, and then the moon, and Blissdetected Daneel's mind, which he, of course, was deliberately reachingout to her. She described that mind as neither quite human nor quiterobotic. In hindsight, that proved to make sense, for Daneel's brain isfar advanced beyond any robot that ever existed, and would not be sensedas simply robotic. Neither would it be sensed as human, however. Peloratreferred to it as `something new' and that served as a trigger for`something new' of my own; a new thought.
<br>&quot;Just as, long ago, Daneel and his colleagueeeorked out a fourthlaw of robotics that was more fundamental than the other three, so Icould suddenly see a third basic axiom of psychohistory that was morefundamental than the other two; a third axiom so fundamental that noone ever bothered to mention it.
<br>&quot;Here it is. The two known axioms deal with human beings, and they arebased on the unspoken axiom that human beings are the only intelligentspecies in the Galaxy, and therefore the only organisms whose actionsare significant in the development of society and history. That is theunstated axiom: that there is only one species of intelligence in theGalaxy and that it is Homo Sapiens . If there were `something new,'
<br>if there were other species of intelligence widely different in nature,then their behavior would not be described accurately by the mathematicsof psychohistory and Seldon's Plan would have no meaning. Do you see?&quot;Trevize was almost shaking with the earnest desire to make himselfunderstood. &quot;Do you see?&quot; he repeated.
<br>Pelorat said, &quot;Yes, I see, but as devil's advocate, oldchap &quot;<br>

&quot;Yes? Go on.&quot;<br>

&quot;Human beings are the only intelligences in theGalaxy.&quot;<br>

&quot;Robots?&quot; said Bliss. &quot;Gaia?&quot;Pelorat thought awhile, then said hesitantly , &quot;Robots haveplayed no significant role in human history since the disappearanceof the Spacers. Gaia has played no significant role until veryrecently. Robots are the creation of human beings, and Gaia is thecreation of robots and both robots and Gala, insofar as theymust be bound by the Three Laws, have no choice but to yield to humanwill. Despite the twenty thousand years Daneel has labored, and the longdevelopment of Gaia, a single word from Golan Trevize, a human being,would put an end to both those labors and that development. It follows,then, that humanity is the only significant species of intelligence inthe Galaxy, and psychohistory remains valid.&quot;<br>

&quot;The only form of intelligence in the Galaxy,&quot; repeated Trevizeslowly. &quot;I agree. Yet we speak so much and so often of the Galaxy that itis all but impossible for us to see that this is not enough. The Galaxyis not the universe. There are other galaxies.&quot;Pelorat and Bliss stirred uneasily. Daneel listened with benigngravity, his hand slowly stroking Fallom's hair.
<br>Trevize said, &quot;Listen to me again. Just outside the Galaxy are theMagellanic Clouds, where no human ship has ever penetrated. Beyond thatare other small galaxies, and not very far away is the giant AndromedaGalaxy, larger than our own. Beyond that are galaxies by the billions.
<br>&quot;Our own Galaxy has developed only one species of an intelligence greatenough to develop a technological society, but what do we know of theother galaxies? Ours may be atypical. In some of the others perhapseven in all there may be many competing intelligent species,struggling with each other, and each incomprehensible to us. Perhapsit is their mutual struggle that preoccupies them, but what if, in somegalaxy, one species gains domination over the rest and then has time toconsider the possibility of penetrating other galaxies.
<br>&quot;Hyperspatially, the Galaxy is a point and so is all theUniverse. We have not visited any other galaxy, and, as far as we know,no intelligent species from another galaxy has ever visited us butthat state of affairs may end someday. And if the invaders come, theyare bound to find ways of turning some human beings against other humanbeings. We have so long had only ourselves to fight that we are usedto such internecine quarrels. An invader that finds us divided againstourselves will dominate us all, or destroy us all. The only true defenseis to produce Galaxia, which cannot be turned against itself and whichcan meet invaders with maximum power.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;The picture you paint is a frightening one. Will we havetime to form Galaxia?&quot;Trevize looked up, as though to penetrate the thick layer ofmoonrock that separated him from the surface and from space; as thoughto force himself to see those far distant galaxies, moving slowly throughunimaginable vistas of space.
<br>He said, &quot;In all human history, no other intelligence has impingedon us, to our knowledge. This need only continue a few more centuries,perhaps little more than one ten thousandth of the time civilizationhas already existed, and we will be safe.
