  <div class="left"><p>As  they left the drawing-room about midnight, Julien found time to say to his  mistress: 'Do not let us meet tonight, your husband has suspicions; I would  swear that that long letter he was reading with such displeasure is an  anonymous one.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>将近午夜，离开客厅时，于连抓住机会对他的情人说：“今晚我们别见面了，您的丈夫起了疑心；我发誓，他叹着气读的那封长信是一封匿名信。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fortunately,  Julien locked himself into his room. Madame de Renal conceived the mad idea  that this warning was simply a pretext for not coming to see her. She lost her  head absolutely, and at the usual hour came to his door. Julien, hearing a  sound in the corridor, instantly blew out his lamp. Someone was attempting to  open his door; was it Madame de Renal, was it a jealous husband?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p></p>

<p>幸好于连把门上了锁。德·莱纳夫人有一个愚蠢的念头，以为这一警告不过是不见她的借口。她确实是昏了头，在惯常的时间来到他的门  前。于连听见走廊里有响动，立刻把灯吹灭。有人使劲推门：是德·莱纳夫人？是嫉妒的丈夫？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Early  the next morning, the cook, who took an interest in Julien, brought him a book  on the cover of which he read these words written in Italian: Guardate alia  pagina.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天一大早，那个日常保护于连的厨娘带给他一本书，他在—封面上读到用意大利文写的几个字：看第一百三十页。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  shuddered at the imprudence, turned to page one hundred and thirty and found  fastened to it with a pin the following letter written in haste, bedewed with  tears, and without the least attempt at spelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连被这种轻率行为吓得发抖，他找到第一百三十页，发现上面用别针别着下面这封信，信写得匆忙，漫满泪水，而且根本不顾拼法。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Ordinarily  Madame de Renal spelt quite well; he was moved by this detail and began to  forget the frightful imprudence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>平时德·莱纳夫人的拼法都很正确，这一细节使于连大为感动，他稍稍忘了这可怕的轻率。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  you would not let me in tonight? There are moments when I feel that I have  never seen into the depths of your heart. Your look frightens me. I am afraid  of you. Great God! Can it be, you have never loved me?In  that case, my husband can discover our love, and shut me up in lifelong  imprisonment, in the country, apart from my children. Perhaps God wills it so.  I shall soon die; but you will be a monster.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“昨天夜里你是不愿意接待我吗？有些时候我觉得从未看清过你的灵魂深处。你的目光让我恐惧。我怕你。伟大的天主啊！你是从来也没  有爱过我吗？如果是这样的话，就让我丈夫发现我们的爱情吧，让他把我关在一座永久的监牢里吧，在乡下，远离我的孩于。也许天主愿意如此。我将很快死去。而你将是一个恶魔。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you not love me? Are you tired of my follies, of my remorse, impious one? Do  you wish to ruin me? I give you an easy method. Go, show this letter to all  Verrieres, or rather show it to M. Valenod alone. Tell him that I love you; but  no, utter no such blasphemy; tell him that I adore you, that life only began  for me on the day when I first saw you; that in the wildest moments of my  girlhood, I had never even dreamed of the happiness that I owe to you; that I  have sacrificed my life to you, that I am sacrificing my soul to you. You know  that I am sacrificing far more.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你不爱我？你对我的疯狂、我的悔恨厌倦了吗，亵渎宗教的人？你想毁了我吗？我告诉你一个容易的办法。去吧，去把这封信给全维里埃的人看，或者更好，让瓦勒诺先生一个人看。告诉他我爱你，不，要说出这亵渎的词，告诉他我崇拜你，我的生活始于我看见你的那一天；告诉他就是在我青年时代最疯狂的时刻里，我甚至都不曾梦到过你给我带来的幸福；告诉他我为你牺牲了我的生命，我还要为你牺牲我的灵魂。你知道我为你牺牲的还要多得多。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  what does he know of sacrifices, that man? Tell him, tell him, to make him  angry, that I defy all evil-speakers, and that there is but one misfortune in  the world for me, that of beholding a change in the one man who holds me to  life. What a blessing for me to lose it, to offer it in sacrifice, and to fear  no longer for my children!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然而这个人知道什么叫牺牲吗？告诉他，为了激怒他，告诉他我不怕这些坏人，我在这世界上只有一个不幸。那就是唯一使我还眷恋生命的那个人变了心。失去生命，把它作为牺牲奉献出去，不再为我的孩子们担惊受怕，这对我是怎样的幸福啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Doubt  not, dear friend, if there be an anonymous letter, it comes from that odious  being who, for the last six years, has pursued me with his loud voice, with a  list of the jumps his horse has taken, with his fatuity and with the endless  enumeration of all his advantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不必怀疑，亲爱的朋友，如果有一封匿名信的话，那肯定是来自这个可憎的家伙，六年来，他一直用他的大嗓门、用他如何跃马飞奔、用他的自命不凡、用无穷无尽地列举他的长处来纠缠我。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is  there an anonymous letter? Wicked one, that is what I wished to discuss with  you; but no, you were right. Clasping you in my arms, for the last time  perhaps, I could never have discussed the matter calmly, as I do when I am  alone. From this moment our happiness will not be so easily secured. Will that  be an annoyance to you? Yes, on the days when ou have not received some amusing  book from M. Fouque. The sacrifice is made; tomorrow, whether there be an  anonymous letter or not, I shall tell my husband that I have received an  anonymous letter, that he must instantly offer you a large sum to accept  another post, find some decent pretext, and send you back without delay to your  family.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有一封匿名信吗？狠心的人呀。这正是我曾经想跟你商量的事情；然而不，你做得对。把你抱在怀里，也许是最后一次，我无论如何也不能像独处时那样冷静地商量。从现在起，我们的幸福就不那么容易了。这会使您不快吗？是的，在您不能从富凯先生那儿收到有趣的书的日子里是这样的。牺牲己经做出，明天，有或没有匿名信，我都会跟我丈夫说我收到了—封匿名信，他必须立刻重金酬谢你，找一个堂皇的借口，立刻把你送回到你父母那儿去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Alas,  dear friend, we are going to be parted for a fortnight, perhaps a month! But  there, I do you justice, you will suffer as much as I. Still, this is the only  way to counteract the effect of this anonymous letter; it is not the first that  my husband has received, and on my account too. Alas! How I have laughed at  them! '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“唉！亲爱的朋友，我们要分别半个月，也许一个月！去吧，我相信你，你将像我一样感到痛苦。可说到底，这是弥补这封匿名信的后果的唯一办法；这也不是我丈夫收到的第一封，也是关于我的。唉！我曾是怎样地一笑置之啊！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

The whole purpose of my scheme is to make my husband think that the  letter comes from M. Valenod; I have no doubt that he is its author. If you  leave the house, do not fail to go and establish yourself at Verrieres. I shall  contrive that my husband conceives the idea of spending a fortnight there, to  prove to the fools that there is no coolness between him and myself. Once you  are at Verrieres, make friends with everyone, even the Liberals. I know that  all the ladies will run after you.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我这行动的全部目的，在于让我丈夫知道匿名信来自瓦勒诺先生；我肯定是他写的。你离开这里之后，一定要住在维里埃。我将让我丈夫也想去那儿住上半个月，向那些笨蛋表明他和我的关系并未冷淡。你一到维里埃，就和所有的人结成友谊，甚至和自由党人。我知道所有那些太太们都巴不得和你结交。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  not go and quarrel with M. Valenod, nor crop his ears, as you once threatened;  on the contrary, show him every politeness. The essential thing is that it  should be known throughout Verrieres that you are going to Valenod's, or to  some other house, for the children's education.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“别跟瓦勒诺先生闹翻，也别割掉他的耳朵，像有一天你说的那样；相反，要尽量装作讨好他。主要是让维里埃的人知道，你将去瓦勒诺家或别的什么人家里教育孩子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is what my husband will never stand. Should he resign himself to it, well, at  least you will be living in Verrieres, and I shall see you sometimes. My  children, who are so fond of you, will go to see you.Great  God! I feel that I love my children more, because they love you.What  remorse! How is all this going to end? I am wandering… Well, you understand  what you must do; be gentle, polite, never contemptuous with these vulgar  personages, I implore you on my knees: they are to be the arbiters of our  destiny. Doubt not for a moment that my husband in dealing with you will  conform to whatever public opinion may prescribe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是我丈夫绝不能忍受的。即使他决心忍受了，那好吧，至少你住在维里埃，我还可以见你几次。我的孩子们那样地爱你，会去看你的。伟大的天主！我感到我更爱我的孩子们了，因为他们爱你。怎样的悔恨啊，这一切将如何结束，……我扯远了……反正你明白你该做什么；跟那些粗俗的人温和些、礼貌些，别看不起人，我跪着恳求你：他们将成为我们的命运的遮盖。一刻也不要怀疑，我丈夫将按照公众舆论规定给他的那样对待你。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is you that are going to provide me with this anonymous letter; arm yourself  with patience and a pair of scissors. Cut out of a book the words you will see  below; paste them together, with water-glue, on the sheet of blue paper that I  send you; it came to me from M. Valenod. Be prepared for a search of your room;  burn the pages of the book you mutilate. If you do not find the words ready  made, have the patience to compose them letter by letter. To spare you trouble,  I have cut the anonymous letter short. Alas! If you no longer love me, as I  fear, how long mine must seem to you!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要由你向我提供匿名信，你要有耐心，还要有一把剪刀。把你将看到的字从一本书上剪下来，然后用口胶把这些字贴在我寄给你的一张发蓝的纸上，纸是从瓦勒诺先生那儿来的。等着有人搜查你的房间；把你剪过的书烧掉。如果找不到现成的字，耐着性子一个个字母拼吧。为了减轻你的劳累，我把匿名信写得很短。唉！如果你像我担心地那样不再爱我了，你会觉得我的信多么长啊！”</p>

<div class="left">

<p>`&quot;MADAME,All  your little goings on are known; but the persons to whose interest it is to  check them have been warned. From a lingering affection for yourself, I beg you  to detach yourself entirely from the little peasant. If you have the wisdom to  do this, your husband will believe that the warning he has received was  misleading, and he will be left in his error.Bear  in mind that I know your secret; tremble, unhappy woman; hence forward you must  tread a straight path, driven by me.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p class="quo">夫人：您的那些小伎俩均已被人识破；但是那些想制止它们的人已被告知。出于我对您尚存的些许友谊，我要求您彻底摆脱那个小乡下人。您若  聪明，这样做了，您的丈夫将相信他接到的通知骗了他，我们亦由他错下去。想想吧，我掌握着您的秘密；发抖吧，不幸的女人；务必从现在开始在我面前走正道。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">

<p>'As  soon as you have finished pasting together the words that make up this letter  (do you recognise the Governor's style in it?) come out of your room, I shall  meet you about the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p class="quo">“你贴完信上的字（你认出了所长的口气吗？），马上走出房子，我等着你。</p>

<p>'I  shall go to the village, and return with a troubled countenance; I shall indeed  be greatly troubled. Great God! What a risk I am running, and all because you  thought you detected an anonymous letter. Finally, with a woebegone face, I  shall give my husband this letter, which will have been handed to me by a  stranger. As for you, go for a walk in the direction of the woods with the  children, and do not return until dinner time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p class="quo">“我将到村里去，回来时神色慌乱，我将确实很慌乱。伟大的天主！我冒的是怎样的风险啊，而这一切都是因为你认为猜到有—封匿名信  。总之，我将愁眉苦脸地将一个不认识的人交给我的这封信交给我丈夫。你呢，你将带孩子们去林中的路上散步，吃饭的时候才回来。</p>

<p>'Ungrateful  wretch, will not your heart find out some way of telling me that you love me,  before starting on this walk? Whatever may befall me, be certain of one thing:  I should not survive for a day a final parting.Ah!  bad mother! These are two idle words that I have written, dear Julien. I do not  feel them; I can think only of you at this moment, I have written them only so  as not to be blamed by you. Now that I find myself brought to the point of  losing you, what use is there in pretence? Yes, let my heart seem black as  night to you, but let me not lie to the man whom I adore! I have been all too  deceitful already in my life. Go to, I forgive you if you love me no longer. I  have not time to read my letter through. It is a small thing in my eyes to pay  with my life for the happy days which I have spent in your arms. You know that  they will cost me more than life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p class="quo">“你的心，负心的人，不会让你在出去散步之前找到办法对我说你爱我吗？无论发生什么事，你对一件事可以肯定：在我们永远分离之后  ，我不会多活一天。啊！坏母亲！我刚刚写下的是对我毫无意义的三个字，亲爱的于连。我对它们没有感觉，此时此刻我能想到的就是你，我写下它们是为了不让你谴责我。现在，我看见我正处在失去你的时刻，掩盖还有什么用？是的，让你觉得我的心是残忍的吧，然而不要让我在我崇拜的男人面前说谎！我在生活中受的骗已经太多了。听着，如果你不再爱我了，我也饶恕你。我没有时间重读我的信。用生命去换取我刚刚在你的怀抱里度过的幸福时光，这在我眼里不算什么。你知道，它们要我付出的代价还要高得多呢。” </p>
