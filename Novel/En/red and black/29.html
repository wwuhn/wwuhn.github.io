  <div class="left"><p>Julien had not yet recovered from the  profound abstraction in which the incident in the Cathedral had plunged him,  when one morning the grim abbe Pirard sent for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>大教堂里发生了那件事之后，于连一直沉浸在幽深的梦幻之中，久久不能解脱，一天早晨，严厉的彼拉神甫打发人来叫他。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Here is M. l'abbe Chas Bernard writing to  me to commend you. I am quite satisfied with your conduct as a whole. You are  extremely imprudent and indeed stupid, without showing it; however, up to the  present your heart is sound and even generous; your intellect is above the  average. Taking you all in all, I see a spark in you which must not be  neglected.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“瞧，夏斯－贝尔纳神甫写信来了，说您的好话呢。总的来说，我对您的行为相当满意。您极不谨慎，甚至轻率冒失，只是没有表现出来罢了，不过到目前为止，您的心是善良的，甚至是宽洪大量的，智力过人。总之，我在您身上看到了一星不容忽视的火花。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'After fifteen years of labour, I am on the  eve of leaving this establishment: my crime is that of having allowed the  seminarists to use their own judgment, and of having neither protected nor  unmasked that secret society of which you have spoken to me at the stool of  penitence.Before I go, I wish to do something for  you; I should have acted two months ago, for you deserve it, but for the  accusation based upon the address of Amanda Binet, which was found in your  possession. I appoint you tutor in the New and Old Testaments.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我工作了十五年，就要离开这幢房子了：我的罪过是让神学院的学生们自由判断，没有保护也没有破坏您在告罪亭里对我说的那个秘密组织。我走之前，想为您做点事情，要不是有根据在您房间发现的阿芒达·比奈的地址所作的揭发，此事我两个月之前就该做了，您理应得到。我让您作《新约》和《旧约》的辅导教师。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien, in a transport of gratitude, quite  thought of falling on his knees and thanking God; but he yielded to a more  genuine impulse. He went up to the abbe Pirard and took his hand, which he  raised to his lips.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连感激得不知说什么好，真想跪下，感谢天主；但是他油然而生另一种更为真实的感情。他走近彼拉神甫，拿起他的手，举到自己的唇边。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> 'What is this?' cried the Director in a tone of annoyance;  but Julien's eyes were even more eloquent than his action.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“这是干什么？”彼拉神甫生气地叫道；然而，于连的眼睛比行动表明了更多的东西。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The abbe Pirard gazed at him in  astonishment, like a man who, in the course of long years, has fallen out of  the way of meeting with delicate emotions. This attention pierced the  Director's armour; his voice changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫惊奇地望着他，仿佛一个多年来已不惯于面对细腻的感情的人一样。这种注视泄露了院长的真情，他的声音变了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah, well! Yes, my child, I am attached to  you. Heaven knows that it is entirely against my will. I ought to be just, and  to feel neither hatred nor love for anyone. Your career will be difficult. I  see in you something that offends the common herd. Jealousy and calumny will  pursue you. In whatever place Providence may set you, your companions will  never set eyes on you without hating you; and if they pretend to love you, it  will be in order to betray you the more surely. For this there is but one  remedy: have recourse only to God, who has given you, to punish you for your  presumption, this necessity of being hated; let your conduct be pure; that is  the sole resource that I can see for you. If you hold fast to the truth with an  invincible embrace, sooner or later your enemies will be put to  confusion.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好吧！是的，我的孩子，我对你很有感情。上天知道这是没有办法的事。我本该公正无私，对人既无恨亦无爱。你的一生将是艰难的。  我在你身上看到了某种使俗人不悦的东西。嫉妒和诽谤将对你穷追不舍。无论天主将你放在什么地方，你的同伴都不会不怀着僧恨看着你；如果他们装作爱你，那是为了更有把握地出卖你。对此只有一个办法，就是只向天主求助，他为了惩罚你的自负而使你必须受人憎恨；你的行为要纯洁，我看这是你唯一的指望。如果你以一种不可战胜的拥抱坚持真理，你的敌人迟早会狼狈不堪的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It was so long since Julien had heard a  friendly voice, that we must forgive him a weakness: he burst into tears. The  abbe Pirard opened his arms to embrace him; the moment was very precious to  them both.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连那么久没有听到过友爱的声音了，不禁泪如雨下，我们应该原谅他的软弱。彼拉神甫朝他张开臂膀，这时刻对两个人来说都是甜蜜的。</p>


</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p> Julien was wild with joy; this promotion was the first that he had  obtained; the advantages were immense. In order to realise them, one must have  been condemned to pass whole months without a moment's solitude, and in  immediate contact with companions at best tiresome, and mostly intolerable.  Their shouts alone would have been enough to create disorder in a sensitive  organism. The boisterous joy of these peasants well fed and well dressed, could  find expression, thought itself complete only when they were shouting with the  full force of their lungs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连欣喜若狂；这是他得到的第一次提升；好处是巨大的。要想象这些好处，须得曾经被迫几个月内不得片刻的独处，并且跟一些至少是讨厌的而大部分是不堪忍受的同学直接接触。单单他们的吵嚷就足以使体质脆弱的人神经错乱。这些吃得饱穿得暖的乡下人，只有在使出两肺的全部力量大叫才能感到那种吵吵闹闹的快乐，才能觉得表达得完全。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Now Julien dined by himself, or almost so,  an hour later than the rest of the seminarists. He had a key to the garden, and  might walk there at the hours when it was empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>现在于连单独用餐，或者差不多，比其他学生晚一个钟头。他有花园的钥匙，园中无人的时候可以进去散步。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Greatly  to his surprise, Julien noticed that they hated him less; he had been  expecting, on the contrary, an intensification of their hatred. That secret  desire that no one should speak to him, which was all too apparent and had made  him so many enemies, was no longer a sign of absurd pride. In the eyes of the  coarse beings among whom he lived, it was a proper sense of his own dignity.  Their hatred diminished perceptibly, especially among the youngest of his  companions, now become his pupils, whom he treated with great courtesy. In  course of time he had even supporters; it became bad form to call him Martin  Luther.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连大感惊异，发觉人家不那么恨他了；他原本料到会有加倍的仇恨呢。他不愿意人家跟他讲话，这种秘而不宣的愿望仍嫌太明显，给他  招来不少敌人，现在不再标志着一种可笑的高傲了。在他周围那些粗俗的人眼里，这是他对自己的职位的一种恰如其分的感觉。仇恨明显减少，尤其在变成他的学生的那些最年轻的同学中间，他待他们也是彬彬有礼的。渐渐地，他居然也有了拥戴者，叫他马丁·路德已经是不得体的了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But why speak of his friends, his enemies?  It is all so ugly, and all the more ugly, the more accurately it is drawn from  life. These are however the only teachers of ethics that the people have, and  without them where should we be? Will the newspaper ever manage to take the  place of the parish priest?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，说出他的敌友的名字，有什么用呢？所有这一切都是丑恶的，图画越真实就越丑恶。不过，他们是民众的唯一的道德教师，没有了他们，民众会变成什么呢？报纸难道能够代替本堂神甫吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Since Julien's promotion, the Director of  the Seminary made a point of never speaking to him except in the presence of  witnesses. This was only prudent, in the master's interest as well as the  pupil's; but more than anything else it was a test. The stern Jansenist  Pirard's invariable principle was: 'Has a man any merit in your eyes? Place an  obstacle in the way of everything that he desires, everything that he  undertakes. If his merit be genuine, he will certainly be able to surmount or  thrust aside your obstacles.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连就任新职以后，神学院院长装作没有证人在场就绝不跟他讲话。这种作法对先生对弟子都是一种谨慎，但尤其是一种考验。彼拉是个严厉的詹森派，他的不变的原则是：您认为一个人有才能吗？那就对他希望的一切、对他所做的一切设置障碍吧。如果他的才能是真的，他就一定会推倒或绕过障碍。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It was the hunting season. Fouque took it  into his head to send to the Seminary a stag and a boar in the name of Julien's  family. The dead animals were left lying in the passage, between kitchen and  refectory.There all the seminarists saw them on their  way to dinner. They aroused much interest. The boar, although stone dead,  frightened the younger boys; they fingered his tusks. Nothing else was spoken  of for a week.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>狩猎的季节到了。富凯心血来潮，以于连的父母的名义给神学院送来一头鹿和一头野猪。两头死兽摆在厨房和食堂之间的过道上。神学院的学生吃饭时从那里经过，都看见了。这成了好奇心的大目标。野猪虽然是死的，也把那些最年轻的学生吓了一跳，他们摸摸它的獠牙。整整一个礼拜，大家不谈别的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This present, which classified Julien's  family in the section of society that one must respect, dealt a mortal blow to  jealousy. It was a form of superiority consecrated by fortune. Chazel and the  most distinguished of the seminarists made overtures to him, and almost  complained to him that he had not warned them of his parents' wealth, and had  thus betrayed them into showing a want of respect for money.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这份礼物把于连的家庭站入社会中应该受到尊敬的那一部分，给了嫉妒一次致命的打击。财富确认了于连的优越。夏泽尔和几位最出色的学生主动接近他，差不多要埋怨他没有把他父母的财产情况告诉他们，害得他们对金钱有失敬之虞。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There was a conscription from which Julien  was exempt in his capacity as a seminarist.This incident moved him deeply. 'And so  there has passed now for ever the moment at which, twenty years ago, a heroic  life would have begun for me!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当时正在征兵，于连是神学院学生，得以免除兵役。这件事使他非常激动。“噍，这个时刻就这么一去不复返了，要是早二十年，我就会开始一种充满英雄气概的生活了！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Walking by himself in the Seminary garden,  he overheard a conversation between two masons who were at work upon the  enclosing wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他独自一个人在神学院的花园里散步，听见几个修围墙的泥瓦匠在说话。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah, well! One will have to go, here's  another conscription.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“喂：该走了，又征新兵了。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In the other man's days, well and good! A  stone mason became an officer, and became a general, that has been known.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“在那个人的时代，那可好了！泥瓦匠能当军官，当将军，这事儿见过。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'The man who is born poor stays poor, and  that's all there is to it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“生下来穷，一辈子穷，就是这么回事儿。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Tell me, now, is it true what people say,  that the other is dead?' put in a third mason.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“嘿，他们说那个人死了，是真的吗？”第三个泥瓦匠说。，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It's the big ones who say that, don't you  see? They were afraid of the other.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是大块头们说的，你看，那个人让他们害怕了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What a difference, how well everything  went in his time! And to think that he was betrayed by his Marshals! There must  always be a traitor somewhere!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“多不同啊，在那个时候，活儿干得也顺！说他是被他的元帅们出卖的：叛徒才这么干呀！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  conversation comforted Julien a little. As he walked away he repeated to  himself with a sigh:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这场谈话使于连稍感宽慰。他离开的时候叹了口气，背诵道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The only King whose memory the people  cherish still!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>人民还怀念着的唯一的国王</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The examinations came round. Julien  answered the questions in a brilliant manner; he saw that Chazel himself was  seeking to display the whole extent of his knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>考试的日子到了。于连答得很出色，他看到夏泽尔也力图显示其全部知识。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the first day, the examiners appointed by the famous Vicar-General de Frilair  greatly resented having always to place first, or at the very most second on  their list this Julien Sorel who had been pointed out to them as the favourite  of the abbe Pirard. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第一天，由著名的福科莱代理主教委派的那些主考人就大为不悦，他们不得不在名单上一再将于连列为第一名，至少是第二名，有人向他  们指出，这个于连·索莱尔是彼拉神甫的宠儿。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Wagers were made in the Seminary that in the  aggregate list of the examinations, Julien would occupy the first place, a  distinction that carried with it the honour of dining with the Bishop.? But at the end of one session, in which the  subject had been the Fathers of the Church, a skilful examiner, after  questioning Julien upon Saint Jerome, and his passion for Cicero, began to  speak of Horace, Virgil and other profane authors. Unknown to his companions,  Julien had learned by heart a great number of passages from these authors.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在神学院，有人打赌说，在考试总成绩的名单上于连一定会名列第一，这将给他带来与主教大人一道进餐的光荣。但是在一场涉及教父们的考试快结束时，一位狡猾的主考人在问了于连关于圣杰洛姆以及他对西塞罗的酷爱的问题之后，又谈到贺拉斯、维吉尔和其他几位世俗作家。同学们都一无所知，于连却背诵了这几位作者的不少段落。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Carried  away by his earlier successes, he forgot where he was and, at the repeated  request of the examiner, recited and paraphrased with enthusiasm several odes  of Horace. Having let him sink deeper and deeper for twenty minutes, suddenly  the examiner's face changed, and he delivered a stinging rebuke to Julien for  having wasted his time in these profane studies, and stuffed his head with  useless if not criminal thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>成功冲昏了他的头脑，他忘了是在什么地方了，根据主考人的一再提问，他满怀激情地背诵和意译了贺拉斯的好几首颂歌。于连上了钩，二十分钟过去了，主考人突然变了脸，尖刻地责备他在这些世俗作家身上浪费了时间，脑子里装了不少无用的或，者罪恶的思想。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am a fool, Sir, and you are right,' said Julien with a modest air, as he saw  the clever stratagem by which he had been taken in.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我是个傻瓜，先生，您说得对，”于连谦卑地说，恍然大悟，原来是个巧妙的圈套，他上当了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  ruse on the examiner's part was considered a dirty trick, even in the Seminary,  though this did not prevent M. l'abbe de Frilair, that clever man, who had so  ably organised the framework of the Bisontine Congregation, and whose reports  to Paris made judges, prefect, and even the general officers of the garrison  tremble, from setting, with his powerful hand, the number 198 against Julien's  name. He was delighted thus to mortify his enemy, the Jansenist Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>主考人的这条诡计，就是在神学院里，也被认为是卑鄙的，然而这并未妨碍德·福利莱先生用他那强有力的手在于连的名字旁边写上１９  ８这个数目。德·福利莱先生是个精明人，他如此巧妙地在贝蒙松组织了一个圣会网，其发往巴黎的快报令法官、省长，直至驻军的将领胆战心惊。他这样地侮辱他的敌人、詹森派信徒彼拉，感到很高兴。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  the last ten years his great ambition had been to remove Pirard from control of  the Seminary. That cleric, following in his own conduct the principles which he  had outlined to Julien, was sincere, devout, innocent of intrigue, devoted to  his duty. But heaven, in its wrath, had given him that splenetic temperament,  bound to feel deeply insults and hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>十年以来，他的大事就是解除彼拉的神学院院长职务。彼拉神甫真诚，虚诚，不搞阴谋，忠于职守，他为于连规定的行为准则自己也遵循不悖。但是上天在愤怒中给了他一副暴躁易怒的脾气，对侮辱和仇恨特别敏感。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Not  one of the affronts that were put upon him was lost upon his ardent spirit. He  would have offered his resignation a hundred times, but he believed that he was  of use in the post in which Providence had placed him. 'I prevent the spread of  Jesuitry and idolatry,' he used to say to himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>对于这颗火热的灵魂，任何侮辱都不会徒劳无功。天主把他放在这个岗位上，他就认为自己对这个岗位是有用的，否则他早就辞职一百次了。“我遏止了耶稣会教义和偶像崇拜。”他对自已说。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  the time of the examinations, it was perhaps two months since he had spoken to  Julien, and yet he was ill for a week, when, on receiving the official letter  announcing the result of the competition, he saw the number 198 set against the  name of that pupil whom he regarded as the glory of his establishment. The only  consolation for this stern character was to concentrate upon Julien all the  vigilance at his command. He was delighted to find in him neither anger nor  thoughts of revenge, nor discouragement.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>考试那段时间，他大概两个月未曾同于连说过话，当他接到宣布考试成绩的公报，看到这个学生的名字旁边写着１９８这个数目，他病例了一个礼拜，他是把这个学生看作本神学院的光荣的呀。对于这个性情严厉的人来说，唯一的安慰是把他所有的监视手段集中用在于连身上。他感到欣喜的是，他在于连身上没有发现愤怒、报复计划和气馁。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some  weeks later, Julien shuddered on receiving a letter; it bore the Paris  postmark. 'At last,' he thought, 'Madame de Renal has remembered her promises.'  A gentleman who signed himself Paul Sorel, and professed to be related to him,  sent him a bill of exchange for five hundred francs. The writer added that if  Julien continued to study with success the best Latin authors, a similar sum  would be sent to him every year.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几个礼拜之后，于连接到一封信，不免打了个哆嗦；信上盖有巴黎的邮戮。“终于，”他想，“德·莱纳夫人想起了她的诺言。”一个署名保尔·索莱尔的先生，自称是他的亲属，给他寄来一张五百法郎的汇票。信上还说，如果于连继读研究那些优秀的拉丁作家，并且卓有成绩，将每年寄给他一笔同样数目的钱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is she, it is her bounty!' Julien said to himself with emotion, 'she wishes to  comfort me; but why is there not one word of affection?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是她，这是她的仁慈：“于连的心充满了柔情，自言自语道，“她想安慰我，可是为什么没有一句有情意的话？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was mistaken with regard to the letter; Madame de Renal, under the influence of  her friend Madame Derville, was entirely absorbed in her own profound remorse.  In spite of herself, she often thought of the strange creature whose coming  into her life had so upset it, but she would never have dreamed of writing to  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这封信他弄错了，德·莱纳夫人在她的朋友德尔维夫人的指导下，已完全沉浸在深深的悔恨中了。她还时常不由自主地想到那个不寻常的  人，与他相遇搅乱了她的生活，但她很注意不给他写信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>If  we spoke the language of the Seminary, we might see a miracle in this windfall  of five hundred francs, and say that it was M. de Frilair himself that heaven  had employed to make this gift to Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>如果使用神学院的语言，我们可以承认这笔五百法郎的汇款是个奇迹，而且可以说上天是利用德·福利莱先生本人送了这份礼物给于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Twelve  years earlier, M. l'abbe de Frilair had arrived at Besancon with the lightest  of portmanteaux, which, the story went, contained his entire fortune. He now  found himself one of the wealthiest landowners in the Department. In the course  of his growing prosperity he had purchased one half of an estate of which the  other half passed by inheritance to M. de La Mole. Hence a great lawsuit  between these worthies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>十二年前，德·福利莱神甫来到贝藏松，带的那只旅行箱小得不能再小，根据传闻，那里面装着他的全部家当。如今他是本省最富有的地  主之一。在他致富的过程中，他买过一块地产的一半，另一半通过继承落入德·拉莫尔侯财手中。两个人于是大打官司。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Despite  his brilliant existence in Paris, and the posts which he held at court, the  Marquis de La Mole felt that it was dangerous to fight down at Besancon against  a Vicar-General who was reputed to make and unmake Prefects. Instead of asking  for a gratuity of fifty thousand francs, disguised under some head or other  that would pass in the budget, and allowing M. de Frilair to win this  pettifogging action for fifty thousand francs, the Marquis took offence. He  believed that he had a case: a fine reason!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>尽管德·拉莫尔侯爵先生在巴黎地位显赫，并在宫中担任要职，还是觉得在贝藏松与一位据称可以左右省长任免的代理主教斗是一件危险的事情。他本来可以请求批准一笔赏赐，以预算允许的随便什么名义为掩盖把这场区区五万法郎的小官司让给德·福利莱神甫，但他没有这样做，而是大光其火。他认为自己有理，而且理由充足！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For,  if we may be so bold as to say it: what judge is there who has not a son, or at  least a cousin to help on in the world?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不过，请允许我斗胆问一句：哪一个法官没有一个儿子或一个什么亲戚需要安插在某个地方呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>To  enlighten the less clear-sighted, a week after the first judgment that he  obtained, M. l'abbe de Frilair took the Bishop's carriage, and went in person  to convey the Cross of the Legion of Honour to his counsel. M. de La Mole,  somewhat dismayed by the bold front assumed by the other side, and feeling that  his own counsel were weakening, asked the advice of the abbe Chelan, who put  him in touch with M. Pirard.</p>
</div>

<p>为了让最盲目的人也看得清楚，德·福利莱神甫在赢得第一次裁决一个礼拜之后，乘上主教大人的四轮马车，亲自把一枚荣誉团骑士勋章  送给他的律师。德·拉莫尔先生对对方的行动感到有些震惊，并且感到他的律师软下来了，就向谢朗神甫求教，谢朗神甫建议他与彼拉先生联系。</p>

<div class="left">

<p>At  the date of our story they had been corresponding thus for some years. The  abbe? Pirard dashed into the business  with all the force of his passionate nature. In constant communication with the  Marquis's counsel, he studied his case, and finding him to be in the right,  openly declared himself a partisan of the Marquis de La Mole against the all  powerful Vicar-General. The latter was furious at such insolence, and coming  from a little Jansenist to boot!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在我们的故事发生的时候，他们的关系已持续了好几年。彼拉神甫带着他那炽烈的性格投入到这件事情中去。他不断地会见侯爵的律师，研究案情，确认侯爵的案于有理之后，就公开地成为德·拉莫尔侯爵的诉讼代理人，与权力很大的代理主教打宫司。这种傲慢无礼，而且还是出自一位小小的詹森派教徒，使代理主教感到了奇耻大辱！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  see what these court nobles are worth who claim to have such power!' the abbe  de Frilair would say to his intimates; 'M. de La Mole has not sent so much as a  wretched Cross to his agent at Besancon, and is going to allow him to be  deprived of his post without a murmur. And yet, my friends write to me, this  noble peer never allows a week to pass without going to show off his blue  riband in the drawing-room of the Keeper of the Seals, for what that is worth.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你们看看这个自以为那么有权势的宫廷贵族是什么东西吧，”德·福利莱神父对他的亲信们说，“德·拉莫尔先生连一枚可怜的勋章都没有给他在贝藏松的代理人送来，而且还要让他灰溜溜地被撤职。但是，有人写信给我说，这位贵族议员每个礼拜都要佩带蓝绶带到掌玺大臣的沙龙去炫耀，不管这掌玺大臣是何等样人！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  spite of all M. Pirard's activity, and albeit M. de La Mole was always on the  best of terms with the Minister of Justice and still more with his officials,  all that he had been able to achieve, after six years of constant effort, was  to avoid actually losing his case.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管彼拉神甫全力以赴，德·拉莫尔先生也和司法大臣，尤其是和他的下属关系好得不能再好，六年的苦心经营也只落得个没有完全输掉这场官司。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  ceaseless correspondence with the abbe Pirard, over an affair which they both  pursued with passion, the Marquis came in time to appreciate the abbe's type of  mind. Gradually, despite the immense gulf between their social positions, their  correspondence took on a tone of friendship.The  abbe Pirard told the Marquis that his enemies were seeking to oblige him, by  their insults, to offer his resignation. In the anger which he felt at the  infamous stratagem (according to him) employed against Julien, he related the  latter's story to the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>为了两个人都热情关注的事情，侯爵不断与彼拉神甫通信，终于品出神甫的那种才智的味道了。渐渐地，尽管社会地位悬殊，他们的通信有了一种亲切的口气。彼拉神甫告诉侯爵，有人采取凌辱他的办法迫使他辞职。那种卑鄙的伎俩使他很生气，他认为是针对于连的，也就向侯爵讲了于连的事情。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Although  extremely rich, this great nobleman was not in the least a miser. He had never  once been able to make the abbe Pirard accept so much as the cost of postage  occasioned by the lawsuit. He took the opportunity to send five hundred francs  to the abbe's favourite pupil.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这位大贵人虽然很有钱，却一点儿也不吝啬，他始终未能让彼拉神甫接受他的钱，包括支付因办案而花去的邮费。他灵机一动，就给神甫心爱的学生汇去五百法郎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole took the trouble to write the covering letter with his own hand.  This set him thinking of the abbe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生还亲自写了那封通知汇款的信。这件事使他想到了神甫。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  day the latter received a short note in which he was requested to call at once,  upon urgent business, at an inn on the outskirts of Besancon.There  he found M. de La Mole's steward.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一天，神甫接到一纸短简，说有急事请他务必到贝藏松郊外一家客店去一趟。他在那里见到了德·拉莫尔先生的管家。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'M.  le Marquis has instructed me to bring you his carriage,' he was informed. 'He  hopes that after you have read this letter, you will find it convenient to  start for Paris, in four or five days from now. I am going to employ the time  which you will be so kind as to indicate to me in visiting the estates of M. le  Marquis in the Franche-Comte. After which, on whatever day suits you, we shall  start for Paris.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“侯爵先生派我给您送来他的马车，”那人对他说，“他希望您在读了此信后能在四、五天后前往巴黎。请您告诉我时间，这期间我将到  侯爵先生在弗朗什—孔泰的地产上跑跑。然后，在您觉得合适的时候我们就启程去巴黎。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  letter was brief:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>信很短：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Rid  yourself, my dear Sir, of all these provincial bickerings, come and breathe a  calmer air in Paris. I am sending you my carriage, which has orders to await  your decision for four days. I shall wait for you myself, in Paris, until  Tuesday. It requires only the word yes, from you, Sir, to make me accept in  your name one of the best livings in the neighbourhood of Paris. The wealthiest  of your future parishioners has never set eyes on you, but is devoted to you  more warmly than you can suppose; he is the Marquis de La Mole.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我亲爱的先生，摆脱掉外省的种种烦恼，到巴黎来呼吸一点儿宁静的空气吧。我给您送去我的车，我已命人在四天内等侯您的决定。我  本人在巴黎等您直到礼拜二。我需要您的同意，先生，以您的名义接受巴黎附近最好的本堂区之一。您未来的本堂区教民中最富有的一位从未见过您，但对您比您能想象的还要忠诚，他就是德·拉莫尔侯爵。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Without  knowing it, the stern abbe Pirard loved this Seminary, peopled with his  enemies, to which, for fifteen years, he had devoted all his thoughts. M. de La  Mole's letter was to him like the sudden appearance of a surgeon with the duty  of performing a painful but necessary operation. His dismissal was certain. He  gave the steward an appointment, in three days' time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>严厉的彼拉神甫没有料到，他居然很爱这座遍布敌人的神学院，十五年来，他为它用尽了心思。德·拉莫尔先生的信仿佛一个要做一次残酷而必要的手术的外科医生出现在他面前。他的解职势在必行。他约管家三日后会面。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  the next forty-eight hours, he was in a fever of uncertainty. Finally, he wrote  to M. de La Mole and composed, for the Bishop's benefit, a letter, a  masterpiece of ecclesiastical diction, though a trifle long. It would have been  difficult to find language more irreproachable, or breathing a more sincere  respect. And yet this letter, intended to give M. de Frilair a trying hour with  his patron, enumerated all the serious grounds for complaint and descended to  the sordid little pinpricks which, after he had borne them, with resignation,  for six years, were forcing the abbe Pirard to leave the diocese.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>四十八小时内，他一直犹豫不决，心烦意乱。最后，他给德·拉莫尔先生写了一封信，又给主教大人写了一封堪称教会体杰作的一封信，只是略嫌长了些。要想找出更无懈可击、流露出更真诚的敬意的句子，也许是件困难的事。这封信注定要让德·福利莱先在主子面前难受一个钟头，信中逐条陈述那些使人严重不满的原因，甚至提到了些卑劣的小麻烦，彼拉神甫不得不忍受了六年，终于逼得他离开教区。</p>

<p>This  letter written, he sent to awaken Julien who, at eight o'clock in the evening,  was already asleep, as were all the seminarists.</p>

<p>'You  know where the Bishop's Palace is?' he said to him in the best Latin; 'take  this letter to Monseigneur. I shall not attempt to conceal from you that I am  sending you amongst wolves. Be all eyes and ears. No prevarication in your  answers; but remember that the man who is questioning you would perhaps take a  real delight in trying to harm you. I am glad, my child, to give you this  experience before I leave you, for I do not conceal from you that the letter  which you are taking contains my resignation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您知道主教住在哪里吗？”他用漂亮的拉丁文风格对他说，“把这封信送交主教大人。我井不瞒您，我是把您往狼群里送。注意看，注  意听。您的回答中不许有半点谎言，但是您要想到，盘问您的人也许会体会到一种终于能加害于您的真正的快乐。我的孩子，在离开您之前告诉您这种经验，我感到十分坦然，因为我不想瞒着您，您送的这封信就是我的辞呈。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien  did not move; he was fond of the abbe Pirard. In vain might prudence warn him:'After this worthy man's departure, the  Sacred Heart party will degrade and perhaps even expel me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连呆立不动，他爱彼拉神甫。谨慎徒然地对他说：“这个正直的人离去之后，圣心派会贬损我，也许会赶走我。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  could not think about himself. What embarrassed him was a sentence which he  wished to cast in a polite form, but really he was incapable of using his mind.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>他不能只想自己。他感到难办的是，如何想出一句得体的话，这时他真地感到才思枯竭了。</p>

<div class="right">
<p>“怎么！我的朋友，您不去？”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  see, Sir, they say,' Julien began timidly, 'that during your long administration  here, you have never put anything aside. I have six hundred francs.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我听人说，先生，”于连怯生生地说，“您主持神学院这么长时间，却没有任何积蓄，我这里有六百法郎。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Tears  prevented him from continuing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>泪水使他说不下去了。</p>

<p>'That  too will be noticed,' said the exDirector of the Seminary coldly.'Go  to the Palace, it is getting late.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这也得登记上，”神学院前院长冷冷地说。“去主教府吧，时间不早了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  luck would have it, that evening M. l'abbe de Frilair was in attendance in the  Bishop's parlour; Monseigneur was dining at the Prefecture.So  that it was to M. de Frilair himself that Julien gave the letter, but he did  not know who he was.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>正巧这天晚上德·福利莱神甫在主教府的客厅里值班；主教大人去省府吃饭了。所以，于连把信交给了德·福利莱神甫本人，不过他并不认识他。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  saw with astonishment that this priest boldly opened the letter addressed to  the Bishop. The fine features of the Vicar-General soon revealed a surprise  mingled with keen pleasure, and his gravity increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连大吃一惊，他看见这位神甫公然拆开了给主教的信。代理主教那张漂亮的面孔立刻显出一种惊奇的表情，其中混杂着强烈的快乐，紧接着又变得加倍的严肃。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  he was reading, Julien, struck by his good looks, had time to examine him. It  was a face that would have had more gravity but for the extreme subtlety that  appeared in certain of its features, and would actually have suggested  dishonesty, if the owner of that handsome face had ceased for a moment to  control it. The nose, which was extremely prominent, formed an unbroken and  perfectly straight line, and gave unfortunately to a profile that otherwise was  most distinguished, an irremediable resemblance to the mask of a fox. In  addition, this abbe who seemed so greatly interested in M. Pirard's  resignation, was dressed with an elegance that greatly pleased Julien, who had  never seen its like on any other priest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这张脸气色很好，于连印象极深，趁他读信的工夫，细细地端详起来。如果不是某些线条显露出一种极端的精明，这张脸会更庄重些；如果这张漂亮面孔的主人万一有一刻走神的话，这种极端的精明会显露出一种虚伪。鼻子太突出，形成一条笔直的线，不幸使一个很高贵的侧影无可救药地酷似一只狐狸。此外，这位看起来如此关心彼拉先生辞职的神甫穿戴高雅，于连很喜欢，他从未见过别的教士如此穿戴。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was only afterwards that Julien learned what was the abbe de Frilair's special  talent. He knew how to amuse his Bishop, a pleasant old man, made to live in  Paris, who regarded Besancon as a place of exile.This  Bishop was extremely shortsighted, and passionately fond of fish.The  abbe de Frilair used to remove the bones from the fish that was set before  Monseigneur.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连只是后来才知道德·福利莱神甫的特殊才能是什么。德·福利莱神甫知道如何逗主教开心。主教是一个可爱的老人，生来就是要住在巴黎的，把来贝藏松视为流放。他的视力极差，又偏偏酷爱吃鱼，于是端上来的鱼就由他先把刺挑干净。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was silently watching the abbe as he read over again the letter of resignation,  when suddenly the door burst open. A lackey, richly attired, passed rapidly  through the room. Julien had barely time to turn towards the door; he saw a  little old man, wearing a pectoral cross. He fell on his knees: the Bishop  bestowed a kind smile upon him as he passed through the room. The handsome abbe  followed him, and Julien was left alone in this parlour, the pious magnificence  of which he could now admire at his leisure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连静静地端详着反复阅读辞呈的神甫，门突然吱呀一声开了。一位穿着华丽的仆人急匆匆走过。于连不及转向门口，就已看见一个小老头儿，胸前佩带着主教十字架。他忙跪倒在地，主教朝他善意地笑了笑，走过去了。那位漂亮的神甫跟上去，于连独自留在客厅里，从容地欣赏起室内虔诚的豪华。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Bishop of Besancon, a man of character, tried, but not crushed by the long  hardships of the Emigration, was more than seventy-five, and cared infinitely  little about what might happen in the next ten years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>贝藏松主教是个风趣的人，饱尝流亡之苦，但并未被压垮；他已然七十五岁，对十年后发生的事情极少关心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  is that clever-looking seminarist, whom I seemed to see as I passed?' said the  Bishop. 'Ought they not, by my orders, to be in their beds at this hour?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我觉得刚才经过时后见一个目光精明的学生，他是谁？”主教问，“根据我的规定，这个时候他们不是该睡觉了吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  one is quite wide awake, I assure you, Monseigneur, and he brings great news:  the resignation of the only Jansenist left in your diocese. That terrible abbe  Pirard understands at last the meaning of a hint.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这一位可清醒着哪，我向您保证，主教大人，而且他带来一个大新闻：还呆在您的教区的唯一的詹森派教徒辞职了。这个可怕的彼拉神  甫终于懂得了说话意味着什么。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,'  said the Bishop with a laugh, 'I defy you to fill his place with a man of his  quality. And to show you the value of the man, I invite him to dine with me  tomorrow.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那好哇！”主教笑着说，“可我不相信您能找到一个抵得上他的人来代替他。为了向您显示这个人的价值，我明天请他来吃饭。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Vicar-General wished to insinuate a few words as to the choice of a successor.  The prelate, little disposed to discuss business, said to him:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>代理主教想趁机说句话，谈谈选择继任者的事。主教不准备谈公事，对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Before  we put in the next man, let us try to discover why this one is going. Fetch me  in that seminarist, the truth is to be found in the mouths of babes.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在让另一位进来之前，先让我们知道知道这一位如何离开吧。给我把那个学生叫来，孩子口中出真言。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was summoned: 'I shall find myself trapped between two inquisitors,' he  thought. Never had he felt more courageous.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有人叫于连。“这下我要处在两个审问者中间了，”他想。他觉得他从未这样勇气十足。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  the moment of his entering the room, two tall valets, better dressed than M.  Valenod himself, were disrobing Monseigneur. The prelate, before coming to the  subject of M. Pirard, thought fit to question Julien about his studies. He  touched upon dogma, and was amazed. Presently he turned to the Humanities,  Virgil, Horace, Cicero. 'Those names,' thought Julien, 'earned me my number  198. I have nothing more to lose, let us try to shine.' He was successful; the  prelate, an excellent humanist himself, was enchanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他进去的时候，两个穿戴比瓦勒诺先生还讲究的贴身男仆正在给主教大人宽衣。这位主教认为应该先同问于连的学习情况，然后再谈彼拉  先生。他谈了谈教理，颇感惊奇。很快他又转向人文学科，谈到维吉尔、贺拉斯、西塞罗。“这些名字，”于连想，“让我得了个第一九八名。我没什么可失去的了，且让我出个风头。”他成功了，主教大喜，他本人就是个优秀的人文学者。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  dinner at the Prefecture, a girl, deservedly famous, had recited the poem of La  Madeleine.He  was in the mood for literary conversation, and at once forgot the abbe Pirard  and everything else, in discussing with the seminarist the important question,  whether Horace had been rich or poor. The prelate quoted a number of odes, but  at times his memory began to fail him, and immediately Julien would recite the  entire ode, with a modest air; what struck the Bishop was that Julien never  departed from the tone of the conversation; he said his twenty or thirty Latin  verses as he would have spoken of what was going on in his Seminary. A long  discussion followed of Virgil and Cicero. At length the prelate could not  refrain from paying the young seminarist a compliment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在省府的宴会上，一位小有名气的年轻姑娘朗诵过一首歌颂玛大肋拉的诗。他正在谈文学的兴头上，很快便忘记了彼拉神甫和其它公事，和这位神学院学生讨论起贺拉斯是富还是穷的问题。主教引证了好几首颂歌，不过他的记忆力有时不大听使唤，于连马上就把整首诗背出来，神情却很谦卑。使主教惊讶不止的是于连始终不离闲谈的口吻，背上二、三十首拉丁诗就像谈神学院里发生的事一样。他们大谈维吉尔、西塞罗。最后，主教不能不夸奖年轻的神学院学生了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  would be impossible to have studied to better advantage.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不可能学得更好了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monseigneur,'  said Julien, 'your Seminary can furnish you with one hundred and ninety-seven  subjects far less unworthy of your esteemed approval.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“主教大人，”于连说，“您的神学院可以向您提供一百九十七个更配得上您的盛赞的人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  so?' said the prelate, astonished at this figure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么回事？”这数字使主教很惊讶。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  can support with official proof what I have the honour to say before  Monseigneur.'At  the annual examination of the Seminary, answering questions upon these very  subjects which have earned me, at this moment, Monseigneur's approval, I  received the number 198.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我可以用官方的证据支持我有幸在主教大人面前说的话。在神学院的年度考试中，我回答的正是此时此刻获得大人赞赏的题目，我得了  第一百九十八名。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  This is the abbe Pirard's favourite,' exclaimed the Bishop, with a laugh, and  with a glance at M. de Frilair; 'we ought to have expected this; but it is all  in fair play. Is it not the case, my friend,' he went on, turning to Julien,  'that they waked you from your sleep to send you here?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“哈！原来是彼拉神甫的宠儿呀，”主教笑着叫道，看了看德·福利莱先生；“我们早该料到的；您是光明磊落的。我的朋友，”他问于连，“是不是人家把您叫醒，打发到这儿来的？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Monseigneur. I have never left the Seminary alone in my life but once, to go  and help M. l'abbe Chas Bernard to decorate the Cathedral, on the feast of  Corpus Christi.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“是的，主教大人。我一生只走出过神学院一次，就是在圣体瞻礼那天帮助夏斯—贝尔纳神甫装饰的大教堂。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Optime,'  said the Bishop; 'what, it was you that showed such great courage, by placing  the bunches of plumes on the baldachino? They make me shudder every year; I am  always afraid of their costing me a man's life. My friend, you will go far; but  I do not wish to cut short your career, which will be brilliant, by letting you  die of hunger.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“０ptime，”主教说，“怎么，表现出那么大的勇气，把几个羽毛束放在华盖上的就是您吗？这些羽毛束年年让我胆战心惊，我总怕它们  要我一条人命。我的朋友，您前程远大；不过，我不想让您饿死在这儿，断送了您那突然光辉灿烂的前程。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And,  on an order from the Bishop, the servants brought in biscuits and Malaga wine,  to which Julien did honour, and even more so than abbe Frilair, who knew that  his Bishop liked to see him eat cheerfully and with a good appetite.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教命人拿来饼干和马拉加酒，于连又吃又喝，德·福利莱神甫更不示弱，因为他知道主教喜欢看人吃得胃口大开，兴高采烈。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  prelate, growing more and more pleased with the close of his evening, spoke for  a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that Julien did not understand. He  then passed to the moral conditions of the Roman Empire, under the Emperors of  the Age of Constantine. The last days of paganism were accompanied by that  state of uneasiness and doubt which, in the nineteenth century, is disturbing  sad and weary minds. Monseigneur remarked that Julien seemed hardly to know  even the name of Tacitus.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这位高级神职人员对他这一夜的余兴越来越满意，他谈了一会儿圣教史。他看出于连并不理解。他转到君士坦丁时代诸皇帝治下罗马帝国  的精神状态。异教的末日曾伴有不安的怀疑的状态，这种状态现又折磨着十九世纪精神忧郁厌倦的人们。主教大人注意到于连竟至于不知道塔西陀的名字。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  replied with candour, to the astonishment of the prelate, that this author was  not to be found in the library of the Seminary.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对于这位高级神职人员的惊异，于连老老实实回答说神学院的图书馆里没有这位作者的书。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am really delighted to hear it,' said the Bishop merrily. 'You relieve me of a  difficulty; for the last ten minutes, I have been trying to think of a way of  thanking you for the pleasant evening which you have given me, and certainly in  a most unexpected manner. Although the gift is scarcely canonical, I should  like to give you a set of Tacitus.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的确很高兴，”主教快活地说，“您帮助我解决了一大难题：十分钟以来我一直想办法感谢您让我度过一个可爱的夜晚，当然是出乎  意料。我没想到我的神学院的学生中会有这样一位饱学之士。我想送您一套塔西陀，尽管这礼物不大符合教规。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>The  prelate sent for eight volumes handsomely bound, and insisted upon writing with  his own hand, on the title page of the first, a Latin in scription to Julien  Sorel. The Bishop prided himself on his fine Latinity; he ended by saying to  him, in a serious tone, completely at variance with his tone throughout the  rest of the conversation:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教让人拿来八册装璜考究的书，并在第一卷的书名上方亲自用拉丁文给于连·索莱尔写了一句赞语。主教向以写得一手漂亮拉丁文自炫；最后，他以一种与谈话截然不同的严肃口吻对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Young  man, if you are wise, you shall one day have the best living in my diocese, and  not a hundred leagues from my episcopal Palace; but you must be wise.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“年轻人，如果您谦虚谨慎，有一天您将得到我的辖区内最好的本堂区，而且并非距我的主教府百里之遥，但是必须谦虚谨慎。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  burdened with his volumes, left the Palace, in great bewilderment, as midnight  was striking.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连抱着八册书出了主教府，大为惊奇，这时，午夜的钟声响</p>

</div></div>

<div class="left">

<p>Monseigneur  had not said a word to him about the abbe Pirard. Julien was astonished most of  all by the extreme politeness shown him by the Bishop. He had never imagined  such an urbanity of form, combined with so natural an air of dignity. He was  greatly struck by the contrast when he set eyes once more on the sombre abbe  Pirard, who awaited him with growing impatience.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教大人跟他没有一句话说到彼拉神甫。于连尤其感到惊奇的是主教极其客气。他想不到如此的文雅竟能与一种如此自然的庄严气派结合  在一起。于连看到彼拉神甫正沉着脸不耐烦地等着他，那对比给他的印象尤其深刻。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Quid  tibi dixerunt? (What did they say to you?)' he shouted at the top of his voice,  the moment Julien came within sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“Ｑuit tibi dixerunt？（他们跟您说了些什么？）”他一看见他就高声同道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Then,  as Julien found some difficulty in translating the Bishop's conversation into  Latin:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连把主教的话译成拉丁文，越译越乱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Speak  French, and repeat to me Monseigneur's own words, without adding or omitting  anything,' said the exDirector of the Seminary, in his harsh tone and  profoundly inelegant manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说法语吧，重复主教大人的原话，不要增也不要减，”神学院前院长说，口气严厉，态度也十分地不雅。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a strange present for a Bishop to make to a young seminarist,' he said as he  turned the pages of the sumptuous Tacitus, the gilded edges of which seemed to  fill him with horror.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一位主教送给一个神学院的年轻学生一份多么奇特的礼物呀！他说，一边翻着精美的塔西陀全集，烫金的切口似乎使他感到厌恶。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  o'clock was striking when, after a detailed report of everything, he allowed  his favourite pupil to retire to his own room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两点钟响了，他听完详细汇报，让心爱的学生回房间了。</p>

<p>'Leave  me the first volume of your Tacitus, which contains the Bishop's inscription,'  he said to him. 'That line of Latin will be your lightning conductor in this  place, when I have gone.'Erit  tibi, fili mi, successor meus tanquam leo quaerens quern devoret. (My successor  will be to you, my son, as a lion seeking whom he may devour.)'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“把您的塔西陀的第一卷留给我，那上面有主教大人的赞语，”他对于连说，“我走后，这一行拉丁文将是您在这所学校里的避雷针。  Erit tibi，filimi，successor meus tamquam leo quoerens quern devoret．（因为对你来说，我的儿子，我的继任者将是一头狂暴的狮子，它将寻找可以吞食的人。）”</p>

<p>On  the following morning, Julien detected something strange in the manner in which  his companions addressed him. This made him all the more reserved. 'Here,' he  thought, 'we have the effect of M. Pirard's resignation. It is known throughout  the place, and I am supposed to be his favourite. There must be an insult  behind this attitude'; but he could not discover it. There was, on the  contrary, an absence of hatred in the eyes of all whom he encountered in the  dormitories. 'What can this mean? It is doubtless a trap, we are playing a  close game.' At length the young seminarist from Verrieres said to him with a  laugh: 'Cornelii Tacitiopera omnia (Complete Works of Tacitus).'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天早晨，于连在同学们和他说话的方式中发现了一桩奇怪的事情。他于是便不多说话了。“看，”他想，“这就是彼拉神甫辞职的后果。整个学院都知道了，我被看作是他的宠儿。在这种方式中一定含有侮辱。”不过，他看不出来。相反，他沿走廊碰见他们，他们的眼中没有了仇恨。“这是怎么回事？这肯定是个圆套。可别让他们钻空子啊。”最后那个维里埃来的小修士笑着对他说：“Cor-neliiTacitioperaomnia（塔西陀全集）。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  this speech, which was overheard, all the rest seemed to vie with one another  in congratulating Julien, not only upon the magnificent present which he had  received from Monseigneur, but also upon the two hours of conversation with  which he had been honoured. It was common knowledge, down to the most trifling  details. From this moment, there was no more jealousy; everyone paid court to  him most humbly; the abbe Castanede who, only yesterday, had treated him with  the utmost insolence, came to take him by the arm and invited him to luncheon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话让他们听见了，他们于是争相恭维他，不仅仅是因为他从主教那儿得到这份精美的礼物，也因为他荣幸地与主教谈话达两个钟头之久。他们连最小的细节都知道。从此，不再有嫉妒，他们卑怯地向他献殷勤：卡斯塔奈德神甫头一天还最为无礼地对待他，也来挽住他的胳膊，请他吃饭。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Owing  to a weakness in Julien's character, the insolence of these coarse creatures  had greatly distressed him; their servility caused him disgust and no pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连本性难移，这些粗俗的人的无礼曾经给他造成许多痛苦，他们的卑躬屈膝又引起他的厌恶，一丝儿快乐也没有。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Towards  midday, the abbe Pirard took leave of his pupils, not without first delivering  a severe allocution. 'Do you seek the honours of this world,' he said to them,  'all social advantages, the pleasure of commanding men, that of defying the  laws and of being insolent to all men with impunity? Or indeed do you seek your  eternal salvation? The most ignorant among you have only to open their eyes to  distinguish between the two paths.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>快近中午，彼拉神甫向学生们告别，少不了又—番严厉的训话。“你们想要世间的荣誉，”他对他们说，“社会上的一切好处，发号施令  的快乐，还是永恒的获救？你们中间学得最差的只要睁开眼睛就能分清这两条路。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>No  sooner had he left than the devotees of the Sacred Heart of Jesus went to chant  a Te Deum in the chapel. Nobody in the Seminary took the late Director's  allocution seriously. 'He is very cross at being dismissed,'was  what might be heard on all sides. Not one seminarist was simple enough to  believe in the voluntary resignation of a post which provided so many  opportunities for dealing with the big contractors.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他一走，那些耶稣圣心派的教徒就到小教堂去唱Ｔe Deum。神学院里没有人把前院长的训话当回事儿。“他对自己被免职极感不快，”到处都有人这么说，神学院的学生中没有一个人会天真地相信有人会自愿辞去一个与那么多大施主有联系的职位。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe Pirard took up his abode in the best inn in Besancon; and on the pretext  of some imaginary private affairs, proposed to spend a couple of days there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫住进贝藏松最漂亮的旅馆，借口有事要办，想在那儿住两天，其实他什么事也没有。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Bishop invited him to dinner, and, to tease his Vicar-General, de Frilair,  endeavoured to make him shine. They had reached the dessert when there arrived  from Paris the strange tidings that the abbe Pirard was appointed to the  splendid living of N ——, within four leagues of the capital. The worthy prelate  congratulated him sincerely. He saw in the whole affair a well played game  which put him in a good humour and gave him the highest opinion of the abbe's  talents. He bestowed upon him a magnificent certificate in Latin, and silenced  the abbe de Frilair, who ventured to make remonstrances.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教请他吃过饭了，为了打趣代理主教，还竭力让他出风头。吃饭后甜点时，传来一个奇怪的消息，彼拉神甫被任命为距首都四法里远的  极好的本堂区Ｎ……的本堂神甫。善良的主教真诚地祝贺他。主教把整个这件事看成是一场玩得巧妙的游戏，因此情绪极好，极高地评价了神甫的才能。他给了他一份用拉丁文写的、极好的证明书，并且不让竟敢提出异议的德·福利莱神甫说话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, Monseigneur carried his admiration to the drawing room of the Marquise  de Rubempre. It was a great piece of news for the select society of Besancon;  people were lost in conjectures as to the meaning of this extraordinary favour.  They saw the abbe Pirard a Bishop already. The sharper wits supposed M. de La  Mole to have become a Minister, and allowed themselves that evening to smile at  the imperious airs which M. l'abbe de Frilair assumed in society.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，主教在德·吕班普莱侯爵夫人处盛赞彼拉神甫。这在贝藏松的上流社会中是一大新闻；人们越猜越糊涂，怎么会得到这样不寻常的恩宠。有人已经看见彼拉神甫当了主教了。最精明的那些人认为是德·拉莫尔先生当了部长了，所以那一天敢于嘲笑德·福利莱神甫在上流社会作出的跋扈神态。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  morning, the abbe Pirard was almost followed through the streets, and the  tradesmen came out to their shop-doors when he went to beg an audience of the  Marquis's judges. For the first time, he was received by them with civility.  The stern Jansenist, indignant at everything that he saw around him, spent a  long time at work with? the counsel whom  he had chosen for the Marquis de La Mole, and then left for Paris.He  was so foolish as to say to two or three lifelong friends who escorted him to  the carriage and stood admiring its heraldic blason, that after governing the  Seminary for fifteen years he was leaving Besancon with five hundred and twenty  francs in savings. These friends embraced him with tears in their eyes, and  then said to one another: The good abbe might have spared himself that lie, it  is really too absurd.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天早晨，彼拉神甫去见审理侯爵案子的法官们，人们几乎在街上尾随他，商人们也站在自家店铺的门口。他第一次受到礼貌的接待。严厉的詹森派信徒对他看到的这一切非常愤怒，跟他为侯爵挑选的那些律师们仔细地讨论了一番，就启程去巴黎，只有两、三个中学时代的朋友一直送他到马车旁，对马车上的纹章赞叹不己。他一时糊涂，竟对他们说，他管理神学院十五年，离开贝藏松时身上只有五百二十—法郎积蓄。这几位朋友流着泪拥抱了他，私下却说：“善良的神甫本可以不说这谎话，这也太可笑了。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  common herd, blinded by love of money, were not fitted to under stand that it  was in his sincerity that the abbe Pirard had found the strength to fight  single-handed for six years against Marie Alacoque, the Sacred Heart of Jesus,  the Jesuits and his Bishop.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>庸俗的人被金钱之爱蒙住眼睛，本不能理解，彼拉神甫正是从他的真诚中汲取必须的力量，六年中单枪匹马地反对玛丽·阿拉科克、耶稣圣心派、耶稣会士们和他自己的主教的。
