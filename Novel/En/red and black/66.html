  <div class="left"><p>Julien  remained motionless, seeing nothing. When he came to himself a little, he  noticed the whole congregation rushing from the church; the priest had left the  altar. Julien set off at a leisurely pace in the wake of some women who were  screaming as they went. One woman, who was trying to escape faster than the  rest, gave him a violent push; he fell. His feet were caught in a chair  overturned by the crowd; as he rose, he felt himself gripped by the collar; it  was a gendarme in full uniform who was arresting him. Mechanically Julien's hand  went to his pocket pistols; but a second gendarme seized him by the arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连站着不动，眼前一无所见。等到他稍微缓过点神来，他发现信徒们纷纷逃出教堂，教士也离开了祭坛。于连跟在几个边喊边逃的女人后面，慢慢的往外走。一个女人想逃得比别人快些，猛地推了他一把，他跌倒了。他的脚被人群撞倒的椅子绊住，当他起来时，感到脖子已被人抓住，一个穿制服的警察把他逮捕了。于连不由自主地想使用他的手枪，但另一个警察扭住了他的胳膊。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was led away to prison. They took him into a room, put irons on his wrists, and  left him by himself; the door was shut on him and double-locked; all this was  carried out quickly, and he remained unconscious of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他被带到监狱，关进一间屋子，带上手铐，孤零零一个人，门上了两道锁；这一切进行得很快，他也毫无感觉。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Faith,  all is over,' he said aloud on coming to himself… 'Yes, in a fortnight the  guillotine … or suicide between now and then.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“天哪，一切都结束了，”他清醒过来后，高声说道，“是的，两个礼拜后上断头台……或者在此之前自杀。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  reasoning went no farther; he felt a pain in his head as though it had been  gripped with violence. He looked round to see if anyone was holding it. A few  moments later, he fell into a deep slumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他不能再往下想了，他觉得自己的脑袋被猛力地夹住。他看了看是否有人抓住了他。不一会儿，他沉沉睡去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal was not mortally wounded. The first bullet had passed through her hat;  as she turned round, the second shot had been fired. This bullet had struck her  in the shoulder, and, what was surprising, had glanced back from the  shoulderblade, which nevertheless it shattered, against a gothic pillar, from  which it broke off a huge splinter of stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人没有受到致命伤。第一颗子弹打穿了她的帽子；她一回头，第二颗子弹射出。子弹击中她的肩膀，奇的是，打断一块骨头后竟被弹回，弹到一根哥特式的柱子上，掀掉很大一块石头。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When,  after a long and painful examination, the surgeon, a grave man,said to Madame  de Renal: 'I answer for your life as for my own,' she was deeply affected.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过长时间的、痛苦的包扎，外科医生，一个很严肃的人，对德·莱纳夫人说：“我可以像担保我自己的生命一样担保您的生命。”她深感痛苦。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  a long time she had sincerely longed for death. The letter which she had been  ordered to write by her confessor of the moment, and had written to M. de La  Mole, had dealt the final blow to this creature weakened by an everpresent  sorrow. This sorrow was Julien's absence;she herself called it remorse. Her  director, a young cleric, virtuous and fervent, recently arrived from Dijon,  was under no illusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>很久以来，她就真诚地盼着死，她给德·拉莫尔先生的信，是她现在的忏悔神甫强迫她写的，这封信给这个因长久的不幸而变得虚弱不堪的人最后一击。这不幸就是于连的离别，而她把这叫做悔恨。那位新从第戎来的神甫，年轻，有德，又热忱，对此看得一清二楚。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  die thus, but not by my own hand, is not a sin,' thought Madame de Renal. 'God  will pardon me perhaps for rejoicing in my death.' She dared not add: 'And to  die by the hand of Julien is the acme of bliss.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就这样死去，但不是死于我的手，就不是一桩罪孽了，”德·莱纳夫人想。“我对死感到高兴，天主也许会饶恕我的。”然而她不敢再说一句，“死于于连之手，实在是最大的幸福。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  soon as she was rid of the presence of the surgeon, and of all her friends who  had come crowding round her, she sent for Elisa, her maid.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>外科医生和那些成群赶来的朋友们刚走，她就把贴身女仆爱丽莎叫来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  gaoler,' she said to her, blushing deeply, 'is a cruel man. Doubtless he  intends to maltreat him, thinking that by so doing he will be pleasing me … The  thought of such a thing is unendurable. Could you not go, as though on your own  behalf, and give the gaoler this packet which contains a few louis? You will  tell him that religion does not permit his maltreating him … But on no account  must he mention this gift of money.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“监狱看守，”她对女仆说，满脸通红，“是个残酷的人，他肯定要虐待他，以为是做了件让我高兴的事……想到这儿我就受不了。您能不能像您自己要去的那样去把这装着几个路易的小包送给监狱看守？您对他说宗教不许他虐待他……尤其不要谈送钱的事儿。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was to this circumstance that Julien was indebted for the humanity of the  gaoler of Verrieres; he was still that M. Noiroud, the loyal supporter of the  government, whom we have seen thrown into such a panic by the arrival of M.  Appert.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正是由于我们谈到的这个情况，于连才受到维里埃的监狱看守的人道待遇，监狱看守还是那位诺瓦鲁先生，无懈可击的司法助理人员，我们看到过阿佩尔先生的到来曾经使他多么害怕。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  magistrate appeared in the prison. 'I have taken life with premeditation,'  Julien said to him; 'I bought the pistols and had them loaded by Soandso, the  gunsmith. Article 1342. of the Penal Code is quite clear, I deserve death and  await it.' The magistrate, surprised by the character of this reply, sought to  multiply his questions so that the accused might contradict himself in his  answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一位法官来到监狱。“我蓄意杀人，”于连说；“我在某武器店买了手枪，并让店主人装上子弹。据民法第一三四二条，我应被判死刑，我等待着死刑。”法官对这种回答问题的方式颇感惊奇，就提出各种各样的问题，想让被告在回答中自相矛盾。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  don't you see,' Julien said to him with a smile, 'that I am making myself out  as guilty as you can wish? Go, Sir, you shall not lack the quarry that you are  pursuing. You shall have the pleasure of passing sentence. Spare me your  presence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但是您没看出来吗，”于连微笑着说，“我像您所希望地那样承认有罪？是吧，先生，您肯定会逮住您所追逐的猎物的。您会得到判决的乐趣的。请您走吧。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have still a tiresome duty to perform,' thought Julien, 'I must write to  Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“还有一桩讨厌的义务要尽，”于连想，“应该给德·拉莫尔小姐写信。”他写道：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have avenged myself,' he told her. 'Unfortunately, my name will appear in the  newspapers, and I cannot escape from this world incognito. I shall die within  two months. My revenge has been terrible, like the grief of being parted from  you. From this moment, I forbid myself to write and to utter your name. Never  speak of me, even to my son: silence is the only way of honouring me. To the  average man I shall be a common murderer … Allow me to tell the truth in this  supreme moment: you will forget me. This great catastrophe, as to which I  recommend you never to open your lips to a living soul, will suppress for some  years all the romantic and unduly adventurous element that I saw in your  character.You  were made to live among the heroes of the Middle Ages; show in this crisis their  firmness of character. Let what is bound to happen be accomplished in secret  and without compromising you. You will take a false name and dispense with a  confidant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>我已复仇。遗憾地是我的名字将出现在报纸上，我不能悄悄地逃离这个世界。我将在两个月内死去。复仇是残酷的，一如与您分别的痛苦。从今以后，我禁止我自己写和说您的名字。永远不要说起我，甚至对我的儿子：沉默是尊重我的唯一方式。对干一般人来说，我将是一个普普通通的杀人犯……在这最后的时刻，允许我说句真话：您将忘掉我。这桩大祸，我劝您永远不要向任何人谈起，将在好几年内耗尽我在您性格中看到的浪漫、冒险的成分。您生来就该与中世纪的英雄们为伍，那就表现出他们的坚定的性格吧。让应该发生的事在秘密中完成，并且不连累您。您可以用一个假名，但不要有知心人。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> If you must absolutely have the assistance of a friend, I bequeath  to you the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>如果您一定需要朋友的帮助，我把彼拉神甫留给您。</p>

<div class="left">

<p>'Do  not speak to anyone else, especially to men of your own class; de Luz or  Caylus.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不要跟任何人谈起，尤其不要跟您那个阶级的人谈起，例如吕兹们，凯吕斯们。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'A  year after my death, marry M. de Croisenois; I order you as your husband. Do  not write to me at all, I should not answer you. Though farless of a villain  than Iago, or so it seems to me, I shall say like him: From this time forth I  never will speak word.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>我死后一年，您就嫁给德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生，我请求您，我以丈夫的名义命令您。不要给我写信，我不会回信的。我觉得我远不如亚果那么坏，我却要像他那样说：“从今以后，我再也不说一句话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No  one shall see me either speak or write; you will have had my last words, with  my last adoration.</p>

<p>人们将不会再看见我说和写了，您现在有的将是我最后的话和最后的倾慕。<br/>

<p>于·索</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was after he had sent off this letter that for the first time, Julien, having  slightly recovered himself, became extremely unhappy. One by one,each of the  hopes of his ambition must be wrenched from his heart by those solemn words: 'I  am to die.' Death, in itself, was not horrible in his eyes. His whole life had  been merely a long preparation for misfortune,and he had certainly never  forgotten what is reckoned the greatest misfortune of all.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>信送出以后，于连稍稍清醒了些，第一次感到非常不幸。“我将死去”这句伟大的话大概已经把那些生自野心的希望一个个从他的心中拔去了，他觉得死亡本身并不可怕。他的一生不过是为不幸做长期的准备罢了，他不会有意忘记这个被认为是最大的不幸的不幸。</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why!'  he said to himself, 'if in sixty days I had to fight a duel with a man who was  a champion fencer, should I be so weak as to think of it incessantly and with  terror in my soul?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！”他心里说，“假使我两个月后要同一个精于使剑的人决斗，我会软弱到老是想着这件事，而且还是心怀恐惧？”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  spent more than an hour in seeking to discover his exact sentiments in this  connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他用了一个多钟头的时间，试图从这个角度认清楚自己。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  he had seen clearly into his soul, and the truth appeared before his eyes as  sharply defined as one of the pillars of his prison, he thought of remorse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当他看清了自己的灵魂，真相呈现在他眼前犹如狱中的柱子一样清晰的时候，他想到了悔恨。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  should I feel any? I have been outraged in a terrible manner; I have taken  life, I deserve death, but that is all. I die after having paid my reckoning  with humanity. I leave behind me no unfulfilled obligation, I owe nothing to  anyone; there is nothing shameful in my death but the instrument of it: that by  itself, it is true, will amply suffice to shame me in the eyes of the townsfolk  of Verrieres; but, from an intellectual point of view, what could be more  contemptible? There remains one way of acquiring distinction in their eyes:  namely, by scattering gold coins among the crowd on my way to the scaffold. My  memory, linked with the thought of gold, will then be resplendent to them.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么我要悔恨？我受到了最残酷的侮辱，我杀了人，理当被判死刑，不过如此罢了。我跟人类结清了帐而后死去。我没有留下任何未尽的义务，我谁也不欠，我的死除了其工具之外没有什么可耻的。的确，单单这一点就足以让我在维里埃的市民眼中蒙受耻辱；然而，从精神方面看，还有比这更可蔑视的吗！我只有一个办法能让他们敬重我，就是在去刑场的路上向民众抛撒金币。想起了我，就想起了金子，这在他们后来就是光辉夺目的了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  this consideration, which at the end of a minute seemed to him conclusive: 'I  have nothing more to do on earth,' Julien said to himself and fell into a deep  slumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连想了想，觉得他的推理明白无误：“我在这个世界上没什么事情可做了，”他对自己说，然后昏昏沉沉地睡着了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>About  nine o'clock in the evening, the gaoler awakened him by bringing in his supper.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上九点钟左右，看守送晚饭来，把他叫醒。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  are they saying in Verrieres?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在维里埃大家都说些什么？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monsieur  Julien, the oath that I took before the Crucifix, in the King's court, the day  I was installed in my post, compels me to keep silence.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“于连先生，我就任这个职务那一天是在王家法院的十字架前宣过誓的，我不能不保持沉默。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was silent, but remained in the room. The spectacle of this vulgar hypocrisy  amused Julien. 'I must,' he thought, 'keep him waiting a long time for the five  francs which he wants as the price of his conscience.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他不说了，然而并不走。看到这种庸俗的虚伪，于连感到开心。“他想拿到五个法郎出卖他的良心，”他想，“我得让他等着。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  the gaoler saw the meal come to an end without any attempt at corruption:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看守见他吃完了饭，还没有收买的表示，就用虚假、温和的口吻对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  friendship that I feel for you, Monsieur Julien,' he began, with a false,  winning air, 'obliges me to speak; although they may say that it is against the  interests of justice, because it may help you to arrange your defence …  Monsieur Julien, who has a good heart, will be glad if I tell him that Madame  de Renal is going on well.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“出于我对您的友谊，于连先生，我不能不说了；尽管有人会说这有悖于法律的利益，因为这可能对您进行辩护有用……于连先生心肠好，如果我告诉他德·莱纳夫人好些了，他一定会感到非常高兴。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  She is not dead?' cried Julien, beside himself with amazement.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么！她没有死？”于连大叫，疯了一样。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  Didn't you know?' said the gaoler with an air of stupidity which presently  turned to one of joyful greed. 'It would only be right for Monsieur to give  something to the surgeon who, according to law and justice, ought not to speak.  But, to oblige Monsieur, I went to his house,and he told me everything… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！您一点儿也不知道！”看守说，愚蠢的表情一变而为兴奋的贪婪。“先生应该送点儿什么给外科医生，根据法律和正义，他是不应该说出去的。可是我为了让先生高兴，就去了他那里，他什么都跟我说了……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  short, the injury is not mortal,' said Julien, losing patience, 'you answer for  that with your life?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说到底，伤势不是致命的，”于连不耐烦地对他说，“你能用生命担保吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  gaoler, a giant six feet in stature, took fright and retreated towards the  door. Julien saw that he was going the wrong way to reach the truth,he sat down  again and tossed a napoleon to M. Noiroud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看守是个六尺高的巨人，也不禁害怕了，直朝门口退。于连看到他采取了错误的手段，这样是弄不清真相的，于是又坐下，扔了一个拿破仑给诺瓦鲁先生。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  the man's story began to convince Julien that Madame de Renal's injury was not  mortal, he felt himself overcome by tears. 'Leave me!' he said suddenly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个人的叙述证明了德·莱纳夫人的伤并未危及生命，于连听着听着，感到眼泪涌了上来。“出去！”他突然对他说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  gaoler obeyed. As soon as the door was shut: 'Great God! She is not dead!'  exclaimed Julien; and he fell on his knees, weeping hot tears.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>看守服从了。门一关上，于连就叫起来：“伟大的天主！她没有死！”他跪了下去，热泪夺眶而出。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  this supreme moment he was a believer. What matter the hypocrisies of the  priests? Can they destroy anything of the truth and sublimity of the idea of  God?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这最后的时刻，他有了信仰。教士的虚伪有什么关系？能使天主的观念所具有的真实和崇高减损分毫吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Only  then did Julien begin to repent of the crime that he had committed. By a  coincidence which saved him from despair, at that moment only had passed away  the state of irritation and semi-insanity in which he had been plunged since  leaving Paris for Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>只是在此刻，于连才开始后悔所犯的罪行。也恰恰在此刻，他从巴黎到维里埃所处的那种肉体冲动和半疯狂的状态刚刚结束，这种巧合使他免于绝望。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  tears sprang from a generous source, he had no doubt as to the sentence that  was in store for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的泪水有着高贵的源头，他对等待着他的判决没有丝毫怀疑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so she will live!' he said to himself… 'She will live to pardon me and to love  me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这么说，她会活下去！”他暗想道……“她会为了宽恕我、爱我而活下去……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Late  next morning, when the gaoler awakened him:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天早晨很晚的时候，看守叫醒他，对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  must have a wonderful heart, Monsieur Julien,' the man said to him. 'Twice I  have come in and did not want to wake you. Here are two bottles of excellent  wine which M. Maslon, our cure, sends you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您肯定有一副好心肠，于连先生。我来了两次，都没忍心叫醒您。这儿有两瓶美酒，是我们的本堂神甫马斯隆先生送来的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What?  Is that rascal here still?' said Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么？这无赖还在这儿？”于连说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Sir,' replied the gaoler, lowering his voice, 'but do not speak so loud, it may  damage you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，先生，”看守压低了嗓音回答说，“别这么大声说话，那会坏了您的事的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  laughed heartily.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连开怀大笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  the stage I have reached, my friend, you alone could damage me, if you ceased  to be gentle and human … You shall be well paid,' Julien broke off, resuming  his imperious air. This air was immediately justified by the gift of a small  coin.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在我目前的情况下，我的朋友，只有您才会坏我的事，如果您不再温和、仁慈……您会得到很好的酬报的，”于连不说了，脸色又变得专横。一枚硬币的赠与立即证实了这种脸色来得多么适时。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Noiroud told him once more, going into the fullest detail, all that he had  heard about Madame de Renal, but he did not mention Miss Elisa's visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>诺瓦鲁先生又详详细细地讲了他关于德·莱纳夫人所知道的一切，但是对爱丽莎小姐来访却只字未提。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  man was as menial and submissive as possible. An idea came into Julien's head:  'This sort of ungainly giant may earn three or four hundred francs, for his  prison is never crowded; I can guarantee him ten thousand francs, if he cares  to escape to Switzerland with me… The difficulty will be to persuade him of my  sincerity.' The thought of the long colloquy that he would have to hold with so  vile a creature filled Julien with disgust, he turned his mind to other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个人简直卑鄙顺从到了极点。于连的脑子里突然闪过一个念头：“这个丑陋的大个子能挣个三、四百法郎，因为他的牢房里关的人不太多；我可以保证他有一万法郎收入，如果他愿意跟我一起逃往瑞士……困难在于让他相信我的诚意。”想到要跟一个如此卑劣的人长时间地商谈，于连感到恶心，他又去想别的事了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, there was no longer time. A postchaise came to fetch him at midnight.  He was charmed with the gendarmes, his travelling companions. In the morning,  when he arrived at the prison of Besancon,they were so kind as to lodge him on  the upper floor of a gothic dungeon. He guessed the architecture to date from  the beginning of the fourteenth century; he admired its grace and pointed  airiness. Through a narrow gap between two walls on the farther side of a deep  courtyard, there was a glimpse of a superb view.</p>

<p>晚上，没有时间了。午夜，一辆驿车来将于连提走。他对几位警察，他的旅伴，感到很满意。早晨，他们到达贝藏松监狱，他被很客气地安置在哥特式主塔楼的最高一层。他判断那是一座十四世纪初的建筑；他欣赏它那优雅和动人的轻盈。越过一个深深的院子，从两堵墙之间的狭窄的缝隙望过去，可以见到一片极美的风景。</p>

<p>Next  day he was examined, after which, for several days, he was left to himself. His  spirit was calm. He could find nothing that was not quite simple in his case:  'I sought to kill, I must be killed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天有过一次审讯，此后一连好几天，都没有人打扰他。他的灵魂是平静的。他觉得自己的案子简单明了：“我蓄意杀人，我应该被杀掉。”</p>

<p>His  thoughts did not linger to consider this argument. The trial, the annoyance of  appearing in public, the defence, he regarded as so many trifling  embarrassments, tiresome ceremonies of which it would be time to think when the  day came. The prospect of death detained him almost as little: 'I shall think  of that after the sentence.' Life was by no means tedious to him, he looked at  everything in a fresh light. He had no ambition left. He thought rarely of  Mademoiselle de La Mole. His remorse occupied him a great deal and often called  up before him the image of Madame de Renal, especially in the silence of the  night, disturbed only, in this lofty dungeon, by the cry of the osprey!</p>

<p>他的思想没有停留在这个念头上，审判，当众出庭的烦恼，辩护，他觉得这都是些小小的麻烦、讨厌的仪式，当天再想不迟。死亡的时刻也拖不住他的思想：“我在宣判以后再想。”生活对他来说一点儿也不烦闷，他从一个新的角度看待所有的事情，他不再有野心了。他很少想到德·拉莫尔小姐。悔恨占据了他的心，常在他眼前呈现出德·莱纳夫人的形象，尤其是夜里。在这高高的塔楼里，只有白尾海雕的叫声划破了夜的寂静！</p>

<p>He  thanked heaven for not having let him wound her mortally. 'An astonishing  thing!' he said to himself, 'I thought that by her letter to M. De La Mole she  had destroyed my future happiness for all time, and, in less than a fortnight  after the date of that letter, I no longer think of all that was occupying my  mind… Two or three thousand livres a year to live quietly in a mountain village  like Vergy… I was happy then … I did not recognise my own happiness!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他感谢上天没有让她受到致命伤。“真是怪事！”他心想，“我本以为她用那封给德·拉莫尔先生的信永远地毁了我的幸福，可从那以后不到半个月，我不再想当时孜孜以求的东西了……两、三千利弗尔的年金，平静地生活在韦尔吉那样的山区里……我当时是幸福的……可我当时身在福中不知福！”</p>

<p>At  other moments, he would rise with a bound from his chair. 'If I had wounded  Madame de Renal mortally, I should have killed myself … I require that  certainty to make me feel a horror of myself. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有时候，他又突然从椅子上跳起来。“如果我让德·莱纳夫人受了致命伤，我就自杀……我需要对此深信不疑、否则我会厌恶我自己。”</p>

<p>'Kill myself! That is the great  question,' he said to himself. Those judges so steeped in formalities, so  thirsty for the blood of the wretched prisoner, who would have the best of  citizens hanged in order to hang a Cross from their own buttonholes… I should  remove myself from their power, from their insults in bad French, which the  local newspaper will proceed to call eloquence.'I  may live for five or six weeks still, more or less … Kill myself! Faith,no,' he  said to himself after a few days, 'Napoleon lived…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“自杀！这是个大问题”他心想。“那些法官，如此看重形式，对可怜的被告如此穷追不舍，为了获得十字勋章，可以把最好的公民吊死……我得摆脱他们的控告，免遭他们用拙劣的法语进行的辱骂，外省报纸把那叫作雄辩……”“我还有五个或六个礼拜好活。或多或少……自杀！不，”几天以后他对自己说。“拿破仑也活下去了……”</p>

<p>'Besides,  life is pleasant to me; this is a quiet spot to stay in; I have no worries,' he  added, laughing, and set to work to make a list of the books which he wished to  have sent to him from Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“再说我的生活很愉快；这里很安静，我一点儿也不觉得烦闷，”他又笑着说，并着手列了个单子，让人把他想看的书从巴黎寄来。<br/>
