  <div class="left"><p>The children adored him, he did not care for them; his thoughts were  elsewhere. Nothing that these urchins could do ever tried his patience.Cold,  just, impassive, and at the same time loved, because his coming had in a  measure banished dullness from the house, he was a good tutor.For his part, he  felt only hatred and horror for the high society in which he was allowed to  occupy the very foot of the table, a position which may perhaps explain his  hatred and horror. There were certain formal dinners at which he could barely  contain his loathing of everything round about him. On Saint Louis's day in  particular, M. Valenod was laying down the law at M. de Renal's; Julien almost  gave himself away;he escaped into the garden, saying that he must look after  the children.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>孩子们崇拜他，他却丝毫也不爱他们，他的心思在别的地方。任这些小家伙做什么，他都耐心对待。冷静，公正，喜怒不形于色，然而受人爱戴，因为他的到来可以说扫除了这个家的烦闷。他是一个好家庭教师。然而对于上流社会，他感到的只是仇恨和厌恶，这个上流社会实际上只是在餐桌的末端接纳了他，这也许解释了他的仇恨和厌恶。在几次盛大的宴会上，他好不容易才克制住对周围的一切所怀有的仇恨。圣路易节那天，瓦勒诺先生在德·莱纳先生家里成为谈话的中心，于连借口看看孩子们，跑进了花园。</p>

<p>'What panegyrics of  honesty!' he exclaimed; 'anyone would say that was the one and only virtue; and  yet what consideration, what a cringing respect for a man who obviously has  doubled and tripled his fortune since he has been in charge of the relief of  the poor! I would wager that he makes something even out of the fund set apart  for the foundlings, those wretches whose need is even more sacred than that of  the other paupers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他嚷道：“对廉洁的颂扬多么动听啊！仿佛这是唯一的美德，然而对于一个自从管理穷人的福利之后显然把自己的财产增加了两、三倍的人，却又那样地敬重，那样地阿谀奉承！我敢打赌，他连专供弃儿使用的经费都要捞，而这些可怜的人的苦难是比其他人的苦难更为神圣的！</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Ah, monsters! Monsters! And I too, I am a sort of foundling, hated  by my father, my brothers, my whole family.'</p>

<div class="right">
<p>啊！恶魔！恶魔！而我也是一种弃儿呀，父亲、哥哥，全家人都恨我。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Some days earlier, Julien walking by himself and saying his office  in a little wood, known as the Belvedere, which overlooks the Cours de la Fidelite,  had tried in vain to avoid his two brothers, whom he saw approaching him by a  solitary path. The jealousy of these rough labourers had been so quickened by  the sight of their brother's handsome black coat, and air of extreme gentility,  as well as by the sincere contempt which he felt for them, that they had  proceeded to thrash him, leaving him there unconscious and bleeding freely.  Madame de Renal, who was out walking with M. Valenod and the Sub-Prefect,  happened to turn into the little wood; she saw Julien lying on the ground and  thought him dead. She was so overcome as to make M. Valenod jealous.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>圣路易节前几天，于连独自在一片小树林里散步，一边念着日课经。这片小树林俯瞰忠诚大道，人称“观景台”。他远远地看见两个哥哥从一条僻静的小路上走过来，想躲也躲不及了。这两个粗鲁的工人看见他那一身漂亮的黑衣服、极其整洁的外貌、他对他们的赤裸裸的轻蔑，不禁妒火中烧，把他揍了一顿，直打得他满脸是血，昏死过去。德·莱纳夫人和瓦勒诺先生、专区区长一起散步，偶然来到这座小树林；她看见于连直挺挺地躺在地上，以为他死了。她是那样的激动，直让瓦勒诺先生嫉妒。</p>
</div></div>

<p>His alarm was <a href="#" title="美 [.primə'tjʊr]
英 ['premətʃə(r)]
    adj.未成熟的；过早的；提前的；早产的
    n.早产的婴儿；过早爆发的炮弹；过早发生的事物">premature</a>.  Julien admired Madame de Renal's looks,but hated her for her beauty; it was the  first reef on which his fortune had nearly foundered. He spoke to her as seldom  as possible, in the hope of making her forget the impulse which, at their first  encounter, had led him to kiss her hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>瓦勒诺先生的担心未免早了点儿。于连觉得德·莱纳夫人很美，然而正是因为这美，他恨她；这是阻止他发迹的第—块礁石，他险些撞上。他尽量少跟她说话，想让她忘掉头一天促使他吻她的手的那种狂热。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Elisa, Madame de Renal's maid, had not failed to fall in love with  the young tutor; she often spoke of him to her mistress. Miss Elisa's love had brought  upon Julien the hatred of one of the footmen. One day he heard this man say to  Elisa: 'You won't speak to me any more, since that greasy tutor has been in the  house.' Julien did not deserve the epithet; but, with the instinct of a good-looking  youth, became doubly attentive to his person. M. Valenod's hatred was  multiplied accordingly. He said in public that so much  concern with one's appearance was not becoming in a young cleric. Barring the  cassock, Julien now wore clerical attire.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人的女仆爱丽莎很快爱上了年轻的家庭教师，常在女主人面前谈到他。爱丽莎对于连的爱情为他招来一个男仆的仇恨。一天，于连听见这个人对爱丽莎说：“自从这个肮脏的家庭教师来了之后，您就不愿再和我说话了。”于连受冤，他并不肮脏，然而，出于漂亮小伙子的本能，他倒是加倍注意仪表了。加倍的还有瓦勒诺先生的嫉恨。他公开地说，一个年轻的教士不应该这样爱打扮。于连不穿黑袍子，他穿的是套装。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Madame de Renal observed that he was speaking more often than before  to Miss Elisa; she learned that these conversations were due to the limitations  of Julien's extremely small wardrobe. He had so scanty a supply of linen that  he was obliged to send it out constantly to be washed,and it was in performing  these little services that Elisa made herself useful to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·菜纳夫人注意到于连和爱丽莎小姐说话比往常更勤了，她又了解到这些交谈是于连的衣服不够穿引起的。于连的内衣很少，不得不经常送到外面去洗，在这些小事情上爱丽莎小姐对他很有用。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This extreme poverty, of which she had had no suspicion, touched  Madame de Renal; she longed to make him presents, but did not dare; this inward  resistance was the first feeling of regret that Julien caused her.Until then  the name of Julien and the sense of a pure and wholly intellectual joy had been  synonymous to her. Tormented by the idea of Julien's poverty, Madame de Renal  spoke to her husband about making him a present of linen:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这种极端的贫穷是德·菜纳夫人没有想到的，她深受触动。她想送他些礼物，但是不敢，这种内心的斗争是于连带给她的第一个痛苦的感觉。在此之前，于连的名字对她来说，完全是一种纯粹的、全然精神性的快乐感觉的同义词。她一想到于连的贫穷就焦虑不安，终于向她的丈夫说要送于连一些内衣。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'What idiocy!' he replied. 'What! Make presents to a man with whom we  are perfectly satisfied, and who is serving us well? It is when he neglects his  duty that we should stimulate his zeal.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“真傻！”他回答说，“怎么搞的！给一个我们完全满意、为我们服务得很好的人送礼？只有在他不好好干的情况下，才需要刺激他的热情。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal felt ashamed of this way of looking at things;  before Julien came she would not have noticed it. She never saw the young cleric's  spotless, though very simple, toilet without asking herself: 'Poor boy, how  ever does he manage?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人对这种看问题的方式感到丢脸，要不是于连来了，她原本是不会注意到的。她每次看见年轻神甫的极其干净、但也极其简单的穿着，都要对自己说：“这可怜的孩子，真难为他了！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As time went on she began to feel sorry for Julien's deficiencies,  in stead of being shocked by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>渐渐地，她对于连缺这少那产生同情，不再感到奇怪。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Madame de Renal was one of those women to be found in the provinces  whom one may easily take to be fools until one has known them for a fortnight.  She had no experience of life, and made no effort at conversation. Endowed with  a delicate and haughty nature, that instinct for happiness natural to all human  beings made her, generally speaking,pay no attention to the actions of the  coarse creatures into whose midst chance had flung her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
有些外省女人，人们在相识的头半个月里很可以把她们当成傻子，德·莱纳夫人就是其中之一。她对人生毫无经验，不喜欢说话。命运将她抛进一群粗俗的人中间，然而她天生一颗敏感而倨傲的心，人人生而有之的那种追求幸福的本能使她大部分时间里对那些人的行为浑然不觉。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>She would have been remarkable for her naturalness and quickness of mind,  had she received the most scanty education; but in her capacity as an heiress  she had been brought up by nuns who practised a passionate devotion to the  Sacred Heart of Jesus, and were animated by a violent hatred of the French as  being enemies of the Jesuits. Madame de Renal had sufficient sense to forget at  once, as absurdities, everything she had learned in the convent; but she put  nothing else in its place, and ended by knowing nothing. The flatteries of  which she had been the <a href="#" title="美 [prɪ'koʊʃəs]
英 [prɪ'kəʊʃəs]
    adj.（能力或行为）早熟的
    网络少年老成的；发育过早的；能力或行为早熟的">precocious</a> object, as the heiress to a large fortune,  and a marked tendency towards passionate devotion, had bred in her an attitude  towards life that was wholly inward. With an outward show of the most perfect  submission,and a self-suppression which the husbands of Verrieres used to quote  as an example to their wives, and which was a source of pride to M. de Renal,  her inner life was, as a matter of fact, <a href="#" title="美 ['dɪk.teɪt]
英 [dɪk'teɪt]
    v.决定；口述；支配；强行规定
    n.规定；命令">dictated</a> by the most lofty disdain.  Any princess who is quoted as an illustration of pride pays infinitely more  attention to what her gentlemen are doing round about her than this meekest of  women, so modest in appearance, gave to anything that her husband said or did.  Until Julien arrived, she had really paid no attention to anyone but her  children. Their little illnesses, their sorrows,their little pleasures absorbed  the whole sensibility of this human soul,which had never, in the whole of her  life, adored anyone save God,while she was at the Sacred Heart in Besancon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>但是如果她受过一点教育，她那淳朴的天性和灵活的头脑就会引人注目。然而她作为女继承人，是由狂热崇拜“耶稣圣心”，对与耶稣会为敌的法国人怀有深仇大恨的修女教养成人的。德·莱纳夫人有足够的理智，把她在修道院里学到的一切视为荒谬，很快忘掉；但是她没有用任何东西来代替，结果变得什么也不知道了。她作为一笔巨大财产的继承人过早地成为阿谀奉承的对象，还有她坚决地倾向于宗教的虔诚，这都使她具有一种完全内向的生活方式。她表面上极其随和，也善于克制个人的意愿，常被维里埃的丈夫们作为榜样让他们的妻子学，德·莱纳先生也引以为自豪，其实她的这种惯常的精神状态不过是一种最高傲的脾性造或的。任何一位因其骄傲而被称道的公主，对那些侍从贵族围绕着她的所作所为给予的注意，也要比这个看起来如此温柔；如此谦逊的女人对她丈夫的所言所行给予的注意多出不知多少。在于连到来之前，她关心的实际上只是她的那些孩子。他们的头疼脑热，他们的痛苦，他们的小小欢乐，占据了这颗心的全部感觉。她在贝藏松的圣心修道院时，只热爱过天主。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Although she did not condescend to say so to anyone, a feverish  attack coming to one of her sons threw her almost into the same state as if the  child had died. A burst of coarse laughter, a shrug of the shoulders,  accompanied by some trivial maxim as to the foolishness of women, had regularly  greeted the confessions of grief of this sort which the need of an outlet had  led her to make to her husband during the first years of their married life. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她不愿意对任何人说，她的一个孩子的一次发烧，几乎能让她急得如同这个孩子已经死了一样。结婚的最初几年，倾吐衷肠的需要促使她把这种痛苦说给丈夫听，然而碰到的总是一阵粗鲁的大笑，耸耸肩膀以及关于女人的傻念头的几句粗俗的格言。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Witticisms of  this sort, especially when they bore upon the illnesses of the children, turned  the dagger in  Madame de Renal's heart. This was all the substitute she found for the <a href="#" title="美 [əb'sikwiəs]
英 [əb'siːkwiəs]

    adj.谄媚的；巴结奉迎的">obsequious</a>,  honeyed flatteries of the Jesuitical convent in which she had passed her  girlhood.She was educated in the school of suffering. Too proud to speak of  griefs of this sort, even to her friend Madame Derville, she imagined that all men  resembled her husband, M. Valenod, and the Sub-Prefect Charcot de Maugiron.  Coarse wit and the most brutal insensibility to everything that did not promise  money, promotion or a Cross; a blind hatred of every argument that went against  them seemed to her to be things natural to the male sex, like the wearing of  boots and felt hats.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>此类笑话，如果和孩子们的病痛有关，就会象匕首一样扎进她的心里。离开了度过少女时代的耶稣会修道院里那种殷勤的、甜得腻人的奉承，德·莫吉隆一样。粗鲁、对一切与金钱、地位和十字勋章无关的事情露骨的麻木，还有对一切使他们感到不快的推理所怀有的盲目仇恨，在她看来，这些东西对男人这个性别来说都是自然而然的，就像穿靴子戴毡帽一样。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After many long years, Madame de Renal had not yet grown accustomed  to these money-grubbing creatures among whom she had to live.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>许多年之后，德·莱纳夫人还是对这些嗜钱如命的人感到不习惯，然而她还得生活在他们中间。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Hence the success  of the little peasant Julien. She found much pleasant enjoyment, radiant with  the charm of novelty, in the sympathy of this proud and noble spirit. Madame de  Renal had soon forgiven him his extreme ignorance, which was an additional  charm, and the roughness of his manners, which she succeeded in improving. She  found that it was worth her while to listen to him, even when they spoke of the  most ordinary things, even when it was a question of a poor dog that had been run  over, as it was crossing the street, by a peasant's cart going by at a trot. The  sight of such a tragedy made her husband utter his coarse laugh, whereas she  saw Julien's fine, beautifully arched black eye-brows wince. Generosity,  nobility of soul, humanity, seemed to her, after a time, to exist only in this  young cleric. She felt for him alone all the sympathy and even admiration which  those virtues arouse in well-bred natures.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>
于连这个小乡下人的成功盖出于此。德·莱纳夫人对这颗高尚而骄傲的心灵充满了同情，从中得到了美妙的、洋溢着新鲜事物的魅力的快乐。她很快就原谅了于连的极端无知，这无知成了他的又一个可爱之处；也原谅了于连的举止生硬，这生硬她竟能加以纠正。她发现他的谈话居然也值得一听，哪怕说的是一条狗横穿马路被农民急驶的大车压死。这个痛苦的场面使她的丈夫哈哈大笑，可于连呢，她看见他蹙紧了乌黑的、弯得很好看的眉毛。渐渐地，她觉得宽厚、灵魂高尚、仁慈只存在于这个年轻的神甫身上。她把这些美德在高贵的心灵中激起的同情心甚至钦佩之情都给了他一个人。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In Paris, Julien's position with regard to Madame de Renal would  very soon have been simplified; but in Paris love is the child of the  novels.The young tutor and his timid mistress would have found in three or four  novels, and even in the lyrics of the Gymnase, a clear statement of their  situation. The novels would have outlined for them the part to be played, shown  them the model to copy; and this model, sooner or later,albeit without the slightest  pleasure, and perhaps with reluctance, vanity would have compelled Julien to  follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在巴黎，于连和德·莱纳夫人的关系很快会变得简单，因为在巴黎，爱情是小说的产儿。年轻的家庭教师和他的腼腆的女主人，可以在三、四本小说、甚至吉姆纳兹剧院的台词中找到对他们的处境的说明。小说可以勾画出要他们扮演的角色，提出可供他们模仿的榜样，而这榜样，虚荣心迟早要逼着于连照着去做，尽管并无丝毫的乐趣，甚至还会感到厌恶。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In a small town of the Aveyron or the Pyrenees, the slightest  incident would have been made decisive by the ardour of the climate. Beneath our  more sombre skies, a penniless young man, who is ambitious only because the  refinement of his nature puts him in need of some of those pleasures which  money provides, is in daily contact with a woman of thirty who is sincerely  virtuous, occupied with her children, and never looks to novels for examples of  conduct. Everything goes slowly,everything happens by degrees in the provinces:  life is more natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在阿韦龙或比利牛斯的一座小城里，气候的炎热可以让最不足道的一件小事变得具有决定性。在我们的比较阴沉的天空下，一个贫穷的年轻人只能野心勃勃，因为他那颗敏感细腻的心灵使他需要一些花钱的享受。他天天都看见一个三十岁的女人，这女人打心眼儿里规规矩矩，心思全在孩子身上，绝不会到小说里去找行动的榜样。在外省，一切都慢慢地来，一切都在逐渐中做成，这反倒更多些自然。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Often, when she thought of the young tutor's poverty,  Madame de Renal was moved to tears. Julien came upon her, one day, actually crying.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人想到年轻的家庭教师的贫穷，常常感到心头一热，流下泪来，有一次让于连撞见，她正哭得伤心。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah, Ma'am, you have had some bad news!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，夫人，您遇到了什么不幸吗？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No, my friend,' was her answer: 'Call the children, let us go for a walk.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不，我的朋友，”她答道，“去叫孩子们来，我们散步去。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>She took his arm and leaned on it in a manner which Julien thought strange.  It was the first time that she had called him 'my friend'.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她挽起于连的胳膊，靠着他，那方式让于连觉得奇怪。她这是第一次称他“我的朋友”。，</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Towards the end of their walk, Julien observed that she was blushing  deeply. She slackened her pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>
散步快结束的时候，于连注意到她的脸通红。她放慢了脚步。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You will have heard,' she said without looking at him, 'that I am  the sole heiress of a very rich aunt who lives at Besancon. She loads me with presents.  My sons are making … such astonishing progress … that I should like to ask you  to accept a little present, as a token of my gratitude. It is only a matter of  a few louis to supply you with linen. But—' she added, blushing even more  deeply, and was silent.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>
“可能有人跟您说过，”她说，并不看他，“我是一个很富有的姑母的唯一继承人，她住在贝藏松，常送我许多礼物……我的儿子们取得了进步……那样地惊人……为表示我的感激之情，我想请您接受一个小小的礼物。不过是几个路易罢了，您好买些内衣。不过……”她的脸更红，并且打住不说了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What, Ma'am?' said Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过什么，夫人？”于连问。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It would be unnecessary,' she went on, lowering her head, 'to speak  of this to my  husband.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“就不必跟我丈夫说了。”她说着低下了头。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I may be humble, Ma'am, but I am not base,' replied Julien coming  to a standstill, his eyes ablaze with anger, and drawing himself up to his full  height. 'That is a point which you have not sufficiently considered. I should  be less than a footman if I put myself in the position of hiding from M. de  Renal anything that had to do with my money.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我出身卑微，夫人，但是我并不低贱，”于连说，停下脚步，并且挺直了身子，“您对此考虑不够啊。如果我对德·莱纳先生隐瞒有关我的钱的任何事情，那我就连一个仆人都不如了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal was overwhelmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人吓呆了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The Mayor,' Julien went on, 'has given me thirty-six francs five  times since I came to live in his house; I am prepared to show my account-book to  M. de Renal or to anyone else, including M. Valenod who hates me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“自从我住到这个家里来，”于连继续说，“市长先生已五次付给我三十六法郎，我随时准备把我的帐本给德·莱纳先生看，给随便什么人看，甚至给恨我的瓦勒诺先生看。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This outburst  left Madame de Renal pale and trembling, and the walk came to an end before  either of them could find an excuse for renewing the conversation. Love for  Madame de Renal became more and more impossible in the proud heart of Julien:  as for her, she respected, she admired him; she had been scolded by him. On the  pretext of making amends for the humiliation which she had unintentionally  caused him,she allowed herself to pay him the most delicate attentions. The  novelty of this procedure kept her happy for a week. Its effect was to some extent  to appease Julien's anger; he was far from seeing anything in it that could be  mistaken for personal affection.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一通发泄之后，德·莱纳夫人一直脸色苍白，浑身发抖，直到散步结束，两个人谁也未能找出个话题来恢复中断了的谈话。在于连那颗骄傲的心里，对德·莱纳夫人的爱情是越来越不可能了；至于她，她尊重他，敬佩他；可她以前曾为此受到过申斥呀。她借口补救她无意中使他蒙受的屈辱，就容许自己给予他最温存的体贴。这种态度的新鲜感使她整整幸福了一个礼拜。结果，于连的愤怒得到部分的平复，但是他远远没有看到其中与个人之间的好感有什么相似的地方。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'That,' he said to himself, 'is what rich people are like: they  humiliate one, and then think they can put things right by a few monkey-tricks.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“看看，”他心想，“这些有钱人就是这样。他们侮辱了一个人，接着以为装装样子就能加以补救！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal's heart was too full, and as yet too innocent for her,notwithstanding  the resolutions she had made, not to tell her husband of the offer she had made  to Julien and the manner in which she had been repulsed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人有一肚子话要说，况且她也太天真，尽管拿定主意，还是不能不把她送钱给于连以及受到回绝的事说给丈夫听。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What,' M. de Renal retorted, with keen annoyance, 'could you  tolerate a refusal from a servant?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么，”德·莱纳先生大为光火，“您居然能够容忍一个仆人的拒绝！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And as Madame de Renal protested at this word:</p>

<p>“我要像已故德·孔岱亲王一样，他在向新夫人介绍内侍们时说：‘这些人都是我们的仆人。’我给您读过博桑瓦尔的《回忆录》中的这一段，这对我们的特权来说至关重要。住在您家里的任何一个人，倘若不是绅士，并且接受一份工资，那他就是您的仆人。我去找这位于连先生谈谈，给他一百法郎。”</p>

<p>'Ah, my dear,' said Madame de Renal trembling, 'please do not say anything  in front of the servants.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊！我的朋友，”德·莱纳夫人战战兢兢地说，“千万别当着仆人们的面呀！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes, they might be jealous, and rightly,' said her husband as he  left the room, thinking of  the magnitude of the sum.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对，他们会嫉妒的，而且有理由，”她的丈夫走开了，一边盘算着这笔钱的数目是不是太大了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal sank down on a chair, almost fainting with grief.'He  is going to humiliate Julien, and it is my fault!' She felt a horror of her  husband, and hid her face in her hands. She promised herself that she would  never confide anything in him again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人一屁股坐在椅子上，痛苦得快要晕过去了。“他要去羞辱于连了，而且是由于我的过错！”她厌恶自己的丈夫，用双手捂住了脸。她发誓绝不再说心里话。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When she next saw Julien, she was trembling all over, her bosom was so  contracted that she could not manage to utter a single word. In her embarrassment  she took his hands and wrung them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她再见到于连的时候，浑身哆哆嗦嗦，胸口抽得那么紧，连一句最简单的话都说不出来。她在窘迫中抓住他的手，紧紧地握住。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well, my friend,' she said to him after a little, 'are you pleased  with my husband?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么样？我的朋友，”她终于说，“您对我的丈夫可满意？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How should I not be?' Julien answered with a bitter smile; 'he has  given me a hundred francs.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我怎么能不满意呢？”于连苦涩地笑了笑，“他给了我一百法郎。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal looked at him as though uncertain what to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·菜纳夫人望着他，心里没有底。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Give me your arm,' she said at length with an accent of courage  which Julien had never yet observed in her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“把您的胳膊给我，”她终于说，那种勇敢劲儿于连从未见过。</p>
</div></div>

<p>She ventured to enter the shop of the Verrieres bookseller, in spite  of his terrible reputation as a Liberal. There she chose books to the value of ten  louis which she gave to her sons. But these books were the ones which she knew  that Julien wanted. She insisted that there, in the bookseller's shop, each of  the children should write his own name in the books that fell to his share.  While Madame de Renal was rejoicing at the partial reparation which she had had  the courage to make to Julien, he was lost in amazement at the quantity of  books which he saw on the bookseller's shelves. Never had he dared to set foot  in so profane a place;his heart beat violently. So far from his having any  thought of trying to guess what was occurring in the heart of Madame de Renal,  he was plunged in meditation as to how it would be possible for a young student  of divinity to procure some of these books. At length the idea came to him that  it might be possible, by a skillful approach, to persuade M. de Renal that he  ought to set his sons, as the subject for an essay, the lives of the celebrated  gentlemen who were natives of the province. </p>

她竟敢一直走进维里埃的书店，毫不在乎书店老板有自由主义思想的可怕名声。她为儿子选购了十路易的书。不过她知道那都是于连想读的。她要求孩子们就在书店里把各自的名字写在分给他们的书上。德·莱纳夫人大胆地采用这种方式向于连道歉，她为此感到幸福，而于连却因为在书店里看见那么多书而感到惊讶。他从未敢进入一个如此世俗的地方，他的心砰砰直跳。他想不到去猜测德·莱纳夫人心里想些什么，只一心一意地捉摸，像他这样的学神学的年轻人有什么办法能得到其中的几本。最后他有了一个主意，有可能巧妙地让德·莱纳先生相信，应该把出生在本省的著名贵族的历史拿来给他的儿子们作法文译拉丁文的练习材料。</p>

<p>After a month of careful <a href="#" title="美 [prɪ'lɪmə.neri]

    n.初步行动（或活动）；预备性措施">preliminaries</a>, he saw his idea prove  successful, so much so that, shortly afterwards, he ventured, in speaking to M.  de Renal, to mention an action considerably more offensive to the noble  Mayor;it was a matter of contributing to the prosperity of a Liberal, by taking  out a subscription at the library. M. de Renal entirely agreed that it was wise  to let his eldest son have a visual impression of various works which he would  hear mentioned in conversation when he went to the Military School; but Julien  found the Mayor obdurate in refusing to go any farther. He suspected a secret  reason, which he was unable to guess.'I was thinking, Sir,' he said to him one  day, 'that it would be highly improper for the name of a respectable gentleman  like a Renal to appear on the dirty ledger of the librarian.'</p>
</div>

<div class="right"><p>经过一个月的精心策划，他看到这个主意成功了，甚至不久之后，他在和德·莱纳先生谈话的时候，居然敢提到一个对高贵的市长来说困难得多的行动，即在书店里订阅书籍，虽说这等于帮助一个自由党人发财。德·莱纳先生也认为，他大儿子将来进军校会听到有人提及某些著作，让他对这些著作觉得“亲眼目睹”过，是明智的，然而于连也看到市长先生死活不肯再进一步。他猜想其中必有不可言明的原因，但是猜不出来。“我一向认为，先生，”有—天，于连对他说，“一位可敬的贵族，例如莱纳家的人，其名字出现在书商的肮脏的登记簿上，是很不合适的。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M. de Renal's face brightened.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生的额头开朗了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  would also be a very bad mark,' Julien went on, in a humbler tone,'against a  poor divinity student, if it should one day be discovered that his name had  been on the ledger of a bookseller who keeps a library. The Liberals might  accuse me of having asked for the most scandalous books;for all one knows they  might even go so far as to write in after my name the titles of those perverse  works.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“对于一个学神学的穷学生来说，”于连继续说，口气谦卑了些，“如果人们有朝一日发现他的名字写在一个出租书籍的书商的登记簿上，这也会是一个很大的污点。那些自由党人会指责我借过最下流的书，谁知道他们会不会在我的名下写上这些邪恶的书的书名呢。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But Julien was going off the track. He saw the Mayor's features  resume their expression of embarrassment and ill humour. Julien was silent. 'I have  my man hooked,' he said to himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>但是，于连走入歧途。他看见市长的脸又挂上了困惑和生气的表情。于连不说话了。他心里想：“我抓住了这家伙。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A few days later, on the eldest boy's questioning Julien as to a  book advertised in the Quotidienne, in M. de Renal's presence:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几天之后，最大的那个孩子当着德·莱纳先生的面，向于连问起《每日新闻》预告过的一本书。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To remove all  occasion for triumph from the Jacobin Party,' said the young tutor, 'and at the  same time to enable me to answer Master Adolphe, one might open a subscription  at the bookshop in the name of the lowest of your  servants.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为了使雅各宾党找不到任何理由感到得意，”年轻的家庭教师说，“同时又使我能够解答阿道夫先生的问题，可以让您府上地位最低的仆人到书店去登记。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That is not at all a bad idea,' said M. de Renal, obviously  delighted.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“唔，这个主意不坏，”德·莱纳先生说，显然很高兴。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Only it would have to be specified,' said Julien with that grave and  almost sorrowful air which becomes certain people so well, when they see the  success of the projects which have been longest in their minds, 'it would have  to be specified that the servant shall not take out any novels.Once they were  in the house, those dangerous works might corrupt Madame's maids, not to speak  of the servant himself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过应该明确规定，”于连说，那种严肃、近乎惋惜的神情对于一个眼看着期望已久的事情终于成功的人很是合适，“应该明确规定这仆人不得拿任何小说。这些危险的书一旦进入府上，就会腐蚀夫人的女仆和这个仆人本人。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'You forget the political pamphlets,' added M. de Renal, in a  haughty tone. He wished to conceal the admiration that he felt for the clever middle  course discovered by his children's tutor.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您忘了政治性的小册子，”德·莱纳先生傲慢地补充说。他孩子的家庭教师想出的这个巧妙的折衷办法博得了他的赞赏，不过他不想表现出来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's life was thus composed of a series of petty negotiations;  and their success was of far more importance to him than the evidence of a marked  preference for himself which was only waiting for him to read it in the heart  of Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的生活就这样由一系列细小的谈判组成，他很关心它们的成功，远胜于关心德·莱纳夫人对他的偏爱之情，这种感情，只要他愿意，就能从她的心里看出。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The moral environment in which he had been placed all his life was  repeated in the household of the worshipful Mayor of Verrieres. There, as in  his father's sawmill, he profoundly despised the people with whom he lived, and  was hated by them. He saw every day, from the remarks made by the Sub-Prefect,  by M. Valenod and by the other friends of the family, with reference to the  things that had just happened under their eyes, how remote their ideas were  from any semblance of reality. Did an action strike him as admirable, it was  precisely what called forth blame from the people round about him. His unspoken  retort was always:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他过去一直生活在其中的那种精神状态，在维里埃的市长先生家里又得以延续，在这里和在他父亲的锯木厂里一样，他打心眼儿里蔑视周围的人，而自己也遭到他们的憎恨。专区区长、瓦勒诺先主、市长家的其他朋友，每天都对眼前发生的事议论一番，于连从中看出他们的思想多么不符合事实。一个行动，他觉得可以称赞，却恰恰要受到他周围那些人的谴责。他内心里总是这样回答他们：

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What monsters!' or 'What fools!' The amusing thing was that, with  all his pride, frequently he understood nothing at all of what was being discussed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“怎样的一群恶人啊！”或者“怎样的一帮蠢人啊：“有趣的是，他虽然那样地骄傲，却常常根本不懂他们说些什么。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In his whole life, he had never spoken with sincerity except to the  old Surgeon-Major; the few ideas that he had bore reference to Napoleon's campaigns  in Italy, or to surgery. His youthful courage took delight in detailed accounts  of the most painful operations; he said to himself: 'I should not have  flinched.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他长这么大，推心置腹地谈过话的只老外科军医一人而已；他仅有的那一点点见解，不是与波拿巴在意大利的战役有关，就是与外科手术有关。他年轻，勇敢，喜欢听关于最痛苦的手术的详尽叙述，他心想：“我连眉头都不皱一皱。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The first time that Madame de Renal attempted a conversation with him  on a subject other than that of the children's education, he began to talk of  surgical operations; she turned pale, and begged him to stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人第一次试图跟他谈谈教育孩子以外的事情，他就大谈外科手术，她吓得脸煞白，求他不要再说下去。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien knew nothing apart from these matters. And so, as he spent  his time with Madame de Renal, the strangest silence grew up between them as  soon as they were alone together. In her own drawing-room,humble as his bearing  was, she found in his eyes an air of intellectual superiority over everyone  that came to the house. Were she left alone for a moment with him, she saw him  grow visibly embarrassed. This troubled her, for her womanly instinct made her  realise that his embarrassment was not in the least degree amorous.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>除此之外，于连一无所知。这样，他跟德·莱纳夫人一起生活，遇到两人独处的时候，就会出现一种最奇怪的沉默。在客厅里，无论他的举止多么谦卑，她总在他的眼睛里发现一种精神优越的神气，所有她家里来的那些人他都不屑一顾。她若单独和他在一起，哪怕短短的一刻，她也会看到他明显地发窘。她感到不安，因为女人的本能告诉她，这种窘迫毫无温情可言。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In consequence of some idea derived from a description of good  society, as the old Surgeon-Major had beheld it, as soon as conversation ceased  in a place where he found himself in the company of a woman,Julien felt <a href="#" title="美 [ə'bæʃ]
英 [ə'bæʃ]

    v.使…羞愧">abashed</a>, as  though he himself were specially to blame for this silence. This sensation was  a hundred times more painful when they were alone. His imagination, full of the  most extravagant, the most Spanish notions as to what a man ought to say, when  he is alone with a woman, offered him in his agitation none but inadmissible ideas. His soul was in the clouds, and yet he  was incapable of breaking the most humiliating silence. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连从老外科军医关于他所见过的上流社会的叙述中，得出了一种莫名其妙的看法，根据这种看法，在他和女人在一起的场合，只要大家不说话了，他就觉得丢脸，仿佛这沉默是他一个人的错。在两人单独谈话的时候，这种感觉更是使人百倍地痛苦。关于一个男人和一个女人独处时应该说些什么，他的想象中充满了最夸张的、最缥缈的观念，只能在他的慌乱中为他提供一些令人不能接受的主意。他的心灵堕入五里雾中，但是他摆脱不了最让人丢脸的沉默。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Thus his air of severity, during his long walks with Madame de Renal  and the children, was intensified by the most cruel sufferings. He despised  himself hideously. If by mischance he forced himself to speak, he found himself  saying the most ridiculous things. To increase his misery, he saw and  exaggerated his own absurdity; but what he did not see was the expression in  his eyes, they were so fine and revealed so burning a soul that, like good  actors, they imparted at times a charming meaning to what was meaningless.  Madame de Renal remarked that,when alone with her, he never expressed himself  well except when he was distracted by some unforeseen occurrence, he never  thought of turning a compliment. As the friends of the family did not spoil her  by offering her new and brilliant ideas, she took a delight in the flashes of Julien's  intellect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于是，在他和德·莱纳夫人及孩子们的长时间的散步中。原本严肃的神情由于这种难以忍受的痛苦就变得更加严肃了。他极其看不起自己。如果他不幸强迫自己说话，他就会说出最为可笑的事情来。最糟糕的是，他看到并且夸大了他的荒唐，然而他看不到的是他眼睛的表情；他的眼睛那么美，显示出一颗那么热烈的灵魂，犹如那些好演员，它们有时赋与事物一种本来并没有的迷人的含义。德·莱纳夫人注意到，他跟她单独在一起时，永远也说不出什么正经的事情来，除非有一件突如其来的事情分散了他的注意力，他不再去想如何把一句恭维话说得漂亮。由于她从到家里来的朋友们那里听不到什么新颖的、出色的思想，所以她能怀着极大的乐趣欣赏于连的智慧的闪光。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Since the fall of Napoleon, all semblance of gallantry in speech has  been sternly banished from the code of provincial behaviour. People are afraid  of losing their posts. The unscrupulous seek support from the Congregation and  hypocrisy has made the most brilliant advances even among the Liberal classes.  Dulness increases. No pleasure is left, save in reading and agriculture.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>自拿破仑倒台以来，向女人献殷勤被从外省的风俗中清除出去，严厉得不留一丝痕迹。人人都害怕失去自己的职位。骗子在圣会中寻求支持。伪善甚至在自由党的圈子里也得到长足的发展。烦闷变本加厉。除了读书种地之外，再没有别的消遣。</p>

<p>Madame de Renal, the wealthy heiress of a religious aunt, married at  sixteen to a worthy gentleman, had never in her life felt or seen anything that  bore the faintest resemblance to love. Her confessor, the good cure Chelan, was  the only person almost who had ever spoken to her of love,with reference to the  advances of M. Valenod, and he had drawn so revolting a picture of it that the  word conveyed nothing to her but the idea of the most abject immorality. She  regarded as an exception, or rather as something quite apart from nature, love  such as she had found it in the very small number of novels that chance had  brought to her notice.Thanks to this ignorance, Madame de Renal, entirely  happy, occupied incessantly with the thought of Julien, was far from reproaching  herself in the slightest degree.</p>

</div>
  <div class="right"><p>德·莱纳夫人是一位虔诚的姑母的富有继承人，十六岁上嫁给一位可敬的绅士，有生以来，连与爱情多少有点相似的感情都从未体验过，也从未见过。只是听她忏悔的善良的本堂神甫谢朗曾经针对瓦勒诺先生的追求跟她谈过爱情，而且向她描绘出一种令人作呕的景象，以至于爱情这个字眼在她的心目中就意味着最下流的淫荡。偶而也有几本小说落到她的眼下，她在那里面发现的爱情被当作一种例外，甚至被当作是不自然的。幸亏这种无知，德·莱纳夫人才感到十分幸福，不断地关心于连，绝想不到要对自己有丝毫的责备。</p>
