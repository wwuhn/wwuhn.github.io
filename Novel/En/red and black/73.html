<p>An hour  later, when he was fast asleep, he was awakened by the tears which he felt  trickling over his hand. 'Ah! Mathilde again,' he thought to himself, half  awake. 'She has come, faithful to her theory, to attack my resolve by force of  tender sentiments.' Irritated by the prospect of this fresh scene in the  pathetic manner, he did not open his eyes. The lines of Belphegor flying from  his wife came into his mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个钟头以后，酣睡中他感到有眼泪流到手上，醒了。“啊！又是玛蒂尔德，”他在迷迷糊糊中想，“她保守她的策略，来用温情攻打我的决心了。”他想到一场新的悲怆景象，心中一阵厌烦，便闭目不睁。贝尔费戈尔逃避妻子的诗句浮上脑际。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  heard a strange sigh; he opened his eyes; it was Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他听见一声奇怪的叹息，睁开眼睛，原来是德·莱纳夫人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah! Do  I see you again before my death? Is it a phantom?' he cried, as he flung  himself at her feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！我死前又看见了你，这是幻觉吗？”他大叫着扑在她的脚下。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  forgive me, Madame, I am nothing but a murderer in your eyes,' he at once  added, regaining his composure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对不起，夫人，我在您眼里不过是个杀人凶手罢了，”他立即又说，完全醒了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir, …  I have come to implore you to appeal, I know that you do not wish to… ' She was  choked by her sobs; she was unable to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生……我来求您提出上诉，我知道您不愿意……”她哽噎着喘不过气，说不出话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Deign  to forgive me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请您宽恕我。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If you  wish me to forgive you,' she said to him, rising and throwing herself into his  arms, 'appeal at once from the sentence of death.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果你想让我宽恕，”她对他说，站起来投进他的怀抱，“那就立刻对你的死刑判决提出上诉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  covered her with kisses.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连在她脸上印满了吻。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Will you come and see me every day during the next two months?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那这两个月里你每天都来看我吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  swear it to you. Every day, unless my husband forbids me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我发誓。每天都来，除非我丈夫反对。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Then I  sign!' cried Julien. 'What! You forgive me! Is it possible?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我签字！”于连叫道。“怎么！你饶恕了我！这可能吗！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  clasped her in his arms; he was mad. She uttered a faint cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他紧紧地把她搂在怀里，他疯了。她轻轻地叫了一声。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is  nothing,' she told him, 'you hurt me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“没什么，”她对他说，“你把我弄疼了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  your shoulder,' cried Julien, bursting into tears. He stepped back from her,  and covered her hand with burning kisses. 'Who would ever have said, last time  I saw you, in your bedroom, at Verrieres … ?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“把你的肩膀弄疼了，”于连的眼泪哗地下来了。他稍稍离开些，在她的手上印满火一样的吻。“我最后一次在维里埃你的房间里见到你，谁能料到竟会有这样的事呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  would ever have said then that I should write M. de La Mole that infamous  letter… ?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁能料到我会给德·拉莫尔先主写那封诬告信呢？……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Know  that I have always loved you, that I have never loved anyone but you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你要知道，我一直爱着你，我只爱你一个人。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is it  really possible?' cried Madame de Renal, equally enraptured. She bowed herself  over Julien, who was kneeling at her feet, and for a long time they wept in  silence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“真的！”德·莱纳夫人叫道，轮到她喜出望外了。她靠在于连身上，于连跪着，他们泪眼相对，久久不说话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At no  time in his life had Julien experienced such a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的一生中，从来没有过这样的时刻。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After a  long interval, when they were able to speak:</p>
</div>
<div cla
<p>过了好久，他们才能说话。</p>
ss="right">

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  that young Madame Michele!' said Madame de Renal, 'or rather that Mademoiselle  de La Mole; for I am beginning really to believe this strange tale!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那位年轻的米什莱太太，”德·莱纳夫人说，“不如干脆叫她德·拉莫尔小姐吧，我开始真的相信这个离奇的故事了！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is  true only in appearance,' replied Julien. 'She is my wife, but she is not my  mistress… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“它只表面上真实，”于连回答说。“她是我的妻子，但不是我的情人……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And,  each interrupting the other a hundred times, they managed with difficulty, each  of them, to tell what the other did not know. The letter sent to M. de La Mole  had been written by the young priest who directed Madame de Renal's conscience,  and then copied out by her. 'What a terrible crime religion has made me  commit!' she said to him; 'though I did modify the worst passages in the  letter… .'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们上百次地互相打断，好不容易把互相不知道的事情讲出来了。那封给德·拉莫尔先生的信是指导德·莱纳夫人神修的年轻教士写好，由她抄的。“宗教让我干了件多可怕的事啊！”她对于连说，“我还把最恶劣的段落改得缓和了些呢……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  transports of joy proved to her how completely he forgave her.Never  had he been so madly in love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连的兴奋和幸福向她证明了他已完全原谅了她。他还从未爱得这般疯狂。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  yet I regard myself as pious,' Madame de Renal told him in the course of their  conversation. 'I believe sincerely in God; I believe equally, indeed it has  been proved to me, that the crime I am committing is fearful, and yet, as soon  as I set eyes on you, even after you have fired at me twice with a pistol… '  Here, in spite of her resistance, Julien covered her with kisses.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过我认为我还是虔诚的，”德·莱纳夫人接着对他说。“我真诚地相信天主，我也相信，而且也得到证实，我犯的罪是可怕的，自从我看见你，甚至你朝我开了两抢之后……”说到这儿于连不顾她反对，连连吻她。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let me  alone,' she went on, 'I wish to argue with you, before I forget… As soon as I  set eyes on you, all sense of duty vanishes, there is nothing left of me but  love for you, or rather love is too feeble a word. I feel for you what I ought  to feel only for God: a blend of respect, love, obedience … In truth, I do not  know what feeling you inspire in me.Were  you to bid me thrust a knife into your gaoler, the crime would be committed  before I had had time to think. Explain this to me in simple terms before I  leave you, I wish to see clearly into my own heart; for in two months we must  part … For that matter, need we part?' she said, with a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“放开我，”她继续说，“我想跟您讲讲清楚，免得忘记……我一看见你，所有的责任感都消失了，只剩下对你的爱，或者说爱这个字还嫌太弱。我对你感到了我只应对天主感到的那种东西：一种混合着尊敬，爱情，服从的东西……实际上，我不知道你在我心中唤起的是什么。你要对我说给看守一刀，我不待想就会去犯罪。在我离开你之前，你把这给我解释清楚吧，我想看清楚我的心；因为两个月后我们就要分别了……顺便说一句，我们要分别了吗？”她对他说，嫣然一笑。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I take  back my word,' cried Julien, springing to his feet; 'I shall not appeal from  the sentence of death, if by poison, knife, pistol, charcoal or any other means  whatsoever, you seek to put an end to, or to endanger your life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我收回我的话，”于连叫道，站了起来，“我不对死刑判决上诉了，如果你试图用毒药、刀子、手枪、木炭或其它方法结束或缩短你的生命。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal's expression altered suddenly; the warmest affection gave place to a  profound abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人的面容突然变了，最温存的柔情让位于深沉的遐想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If we  were to die at once?' she said to him at length.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们要是马上死呢？”最后她说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  knows what we shall find in our next life?' replied Julien;'torments perhaps,  perhaps nothing at all. Can we not spend two months together in a delicious  manner? Two months, that is ever so many days.Never  shall I have been so happy.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁知道另一个世界有什么？”于连答道，“也许是痛苦，也许什么也没有。难道我们不能甜甜蜜蜜地共同过上两个月吗？两个月，那是许多天呀。我永远不会这样幸福的！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  will never have been so happy?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“你永远不会这样幸福的！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never,'  replied Julien with rapture, 'and I am speaking to you as I speak to myself.  Heaven preserve me from exaggeration.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“永远不会，” 于连大喜，重复道，   &quot;我跟你说话，就象跟我自己说话一样。天主不容我夸大。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  speak so is to command me,' she said with a timid and melancholy smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你这样说话，就是命令我，”她说，露出了羞怯而忧郁的微笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  well! You swear, by the love that you bear me, not to attempt your life by any  direct means, or indirect means… Remember,' he added, 'that you are compelled  to live for my son, whom Mathilde will abandon to the care of servants as soon  as she is Marquise de Croisenois.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那好！你以你对我的爱发誓，不以任何直接或间接的方式谋害你的生命……你要记住，”他补充说，“你必须为了我的儿子活下去，玛蒂尔德一时成为德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦候爵夫人，就会把他扔给仆人们。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  swear,' she replied coldly, 'but I mean to take away with me your appeal  written and signed by your hand. I shall go myself to the Attorney General.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我发誓，”她冷冷地说，“但是我要带走你亲笔写的、有你的签字的上诉状。我亲自去找总检察长先生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Take  care, you will compromise yourself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“当心，这会连累你的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'After  coming publicly to see you in prison, I am for ever, for Besancon and the whole  of the Franche-Comte, a heroine of anecdotes,' she said with an air of profound  distress. 'I have gone beyond the last limits of modesty… I am a woman who has  forfeited her honour; it is true that it was for your sake … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在我来监狱看你之后，我就永远成了贝藏松和整个弗朗什－孔泰街谈巷议的女主角了，”她神情悲痛地说。“严厉的廉耻的界限已经越过……我是一个丧失名誉的女人，真的，这是为了你……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  tone was so melancholy that Julien embraced her with a happiness that was quite  new to him. It was no longer the intoxication of love, it was extreme  gratitude. He had just realised, for the first time, the full extent of the  sacrifice that she had made for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她的口气那么悲伤，于连拥抱了她，感到一种全新的幸福。那已经不是爱的陶醉，而是极端的感激了。他第一次看到她为他做出的牺牲有多么巨大。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some  charitable soul doubtless informed M. de Renal of the long visits which his  wife was paying to Julien's prison; for, after three days, he sent his carriage  for her, with express orders that she was to return immediately to Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>显然有个好心的人告诉了德·莱纳先生，他妻子去监狱看望于连，在那儿呆了很长时间；因为过了三天，他派了车来，明令她即刻回维里埃。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  cruel parting had begun the day ill for Julien. He was informed, two or three  hours later, that a certain intriguing priest, who for all that had not  succeeded in making any headway among the Jesuits of Besancon, had taken his  stand that morning outside the gate of the prison, in the street. It was  raining hard, and outside there the man was trying to pose as a martyr. Julien  was out of temper, this piece of foolishness moved him profoundly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这残酷的分别使于连的这一天开始就不顺。两、三个钟头以后，有人告诉他，有个诡计多端，但在贝藏松的耶稣会里未能爬上去的教士，一大早就站在了监狱门外的路上。雨下得很大，那家伙企图装出受难的样子。于连心绪恶劣，这种蠢事使他大为恼火。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  morning he had already refused a visit from the priest, but the man had made up  his mind to hear Julien's confession, and to make a name for himself among the  young women of Besancon, on the strength of all the confidences which he would  pretend to have received.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>早晨他已拒绝这个教士的探望，然而此人打算让于连作忏悔，然后利用他认为肯定可以获悉的所有那些隐情，在贝藏松的年轻女人中博取名声。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  declared in a loud voice that he was going to remain day and night at the gate  of the prison: 'God has sent me to touch the heart of this other apostate.' And  the lower orders, always curious spectators of a scene,began to assemble in  crowds.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他高声宣布，他要在监狱门口度过白天和黑夜；“天主派我来打动这个叛教者的心……”老百姓总是喜欢看热闹，开始聚集起来。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  my brethren,' he said to them, 'I shall spend the day here, and the night, and  every day and night from now onwards. The Holy Spirit has spoken to me. I have  a mission from on high; it is I that am to save the soul of young Sorel. Join  with me in my prayers,' etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，我的弟兄们，”他对他们说，“我要在这里度过白天，黑夜，以及此后的年有白天和年有黑夜。圣灵跟我说过话，我负有上天的使命；我要拯救年轻的索莱尔的灵魂。跟我一起祈祷吧……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had a horror of scandal, and of anything that might attract attention to himself.  He thought of seizing the opportunity to escape from the world unknown; but he  had still some hope of seeing Madame de Renal again, and was desperately in  love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连讨厌人家议论他，讨厌一切能够把注意力引向他的事情。他想抓住时机悄悄地逃离这个世界；然而他又存着再见德·莱纳夫人的希望，他爱得发了狂。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  gate of the prison was situated in one of the most frequented streets. The  thought of that mud-be-spattered priest, drawing a crowd and creating a  scandal, was torture to his soul. 'And, without a doubt, at every instant he is  repeating my name!' This moment was more painful than death itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>监狱的门朝着一条很热闹的街。想到这个一身泥巴的教士招来一大群人议论纷纷，他的心备受折磨。“毫无疑问，他每时刻都提到我的名字！”这时刻比死亡还让人难受。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  called two or three times, at intervals of an hour, for a turnkey who was  devoted to him, to send him out to see whether the priest were still at the  gate of the prison.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一个看守对他很忠心，他一个钟头里叫了他两、三回，让他去看看那教士是不是还在监狱门口。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,  he is on both his knees in the mud,' was the turnkey's invariable answer; 'he  is praying aloud, and repeating Litanies for your soul.' 'The impertinent  fellow!' thought Julien. At that moment, indeed, he heard a dull roar, it was  the crowd responding to the Litany. To increase his impatience, he saw the  turnkey move his lips as he repeated the Latin words. 'They are beginning to  say,' the turnkey added, 'that your heart must indeed be hardened if you refuse  the succour of this holy man.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，他跪在泥水里，”看守每次都对他说，“他高声祈祷，为您的灵魂念连祷文……”“无礼的家伙！”于连想，这时候，他果然听见一片低沉的嗡嗡声，那是人们应答连祷文的声音。更使他不耐烦的是，他看见看守本人也嘴唇一动一动地念着拉丁文。“有人开始说，”看守说，“您的心肠一定很硬，才会拒绝这个圣洁的人的帮助。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'O my  country! How barbarous you still are!' cried Julien in a frenzy of rage. And he  continued his reasoning aloud, without a thought of the turnkey's presence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的祖国啊！你还是这么地野蛮！”于连气疯了，嚷道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  man wants an article in the paper, and now he is certain of obtaining it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这家伙想在报上有一篇文章，他肯定会得到的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  cursed provincials! In Paris, I should not have been subjected to all these  vexations. They are more adept there in charlatanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！该下地狱的外省人！在巴黎，我可不受这样的气。那儿的人招摇撞骗要高明得多。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let  this holy priest come in,' he said at length to the turnkey, and the sweat  trickled in great drops from his brow. The turnkey made the sign of the Cross,  and left the cell radiant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让那个圣洁的教士进来吧，”最后分对看守说，额上的汗直往下淌。看守画了个十字，高高兴兴地出去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  holy priest proved to be hideously ugly, and was even more foul with mud. The  cold rain outside intensified the darkness and dampness of the cell. The priest  tried to embrace Julien, and began to show emotion as he spoke to him. The  vilest hypocrisy was all too evident; never in his life had Julien been in such  a rage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>那个圣洁的教士丑得可怕，而且还浑身是泥。冰冷的雨水更增加了黑牢的阴暗和潮湿。教士想拥抱于连，说话间拿出了深受感动的样子。最卑劣的伪善实在太明显；于连一辈子还不曾这么愤怒过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  quarter of an hour after the priest had entered, Julien found himself a  complete coward. For the first time death appeared to him horrible. He thought  of the state of putrefaction in which his body would be two days after his  execution, etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>教士进来已经一刻钟，于连完全成了个懦夫。他第一次觉得死是可怕的。他想到执行后两天，尸体开始腐烂……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He was  on the point of betraying himself by some sign of weakness, or of flinging  himself upon the priest and strangling him with his chain, when it occurred to  him to beg the holy man to go and say a good forty franc mass for him, that  very day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他正要表现出软弱，或者扑向教士，用锁链勒死他，这时候突然想。何不请这个圣洁的人为他举行一次四十法郎的弥撒，就在当天。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As it  was almost midday, the priest decamped.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>时间快到中午。教士走了。   </p>
</div></div>
