<p>At  length he made out, on a distant mountain, a line of dark walls; it was the  citadel of Besancon. 'How different for me,' he said with a sigh,' if I were  arriving in this noble fortress to be a sub-lieutenant in one of the regiments  entrusted with its defence!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>终于，他看见远处山上有些黑色的围墙，那是贝藏松的堡垒。他叹了口气：“如果我来到这座军事重镇，为的是在受命保卫它的一个团里当一名少尉，那是多么地不同啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Besancon  is not merely one of the most charming towns in France, it abounds in men and  women of feeling and spirit. But Julien was only a young peasant and had no way  of approaching the distinguished people.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>贝藏松不仅仅是法国最漂亮的城市之一，还拥有许多有勇气有才智的人。然而于连只是一个小小的农民，根本无法接近那些出类拔萃的人物。</p>

<p>He  had borrowed from Fouque a layman's coat, and it was in this attire that he  crossed the drawbridges. His mind full of the history of the siege of 1674, he  was determined to visit, before shutting himself up in the Seminary, the  ramparts and the citadel. More than once, he was on the point of being arrested  by the sentries for making his way into places from which the engineers of the  garrison excluded the public, in order to make a profit of twelve or fifteen  francs every year by the sale of the hay grown there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他从富凯那里拿了一套便服，他就是穿着这套衣服走过吊桥的。他的脑海里装满了一六七四年围城战的历史，想在被关进神学院之前看看那些城墙和堡垒。他有二、三次险些让哨兵抓起来，他进入工兵部队为了每年能卖上十二或十五法郎的干草而让行人止步的区域内了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  height of the walls, the depth of the moats, the awe-inspiring appearance of  the guns had occupied him for some hours, when he happened to pass by the  principal cafe, on the boulevard. He stood speechless with admiration; albeit  he could read the word Cafe inscribed in huge letters over the two vast doors,  he could not believe his eyes. He made an effort to master his timidity; he  ventured to enter, and found himself in a hall thirty or forty feet long, the  ceiling of which rose to a height of at least twenty feet. On this day of days  everything wore an air of enchantment for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有好几个钟头，他的所见尽是高墙、深沟和样子吓人的大炮，后来他走到林荫大道上的咖啡馆前。他赞叹不已，呆住不动了，他明明看见两扇大门上方写着咖啡馆几个大字，还是不能相信自己的眼晴，他竭力克制胆怯，大着胆子进去，那间大厅长三、四十步，天花板至少高二十尺。这一天，在他后来，一切都如仙境一般。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  games of billiards were in progress. The waiters were calling out the scores;  the players hurried round the tables through a crowd of on-lookers. Streams of  tobacco smoke, pouring from every mouth, enveloped them in a blue haze. The  tall stature of these men, their rounded shoulders, their heavy gait, their  bushy whiskers, the long frock coats that coveted their bodies, all attracted  Julien's attention. These noble sons of ancient Bisontium conversed only in  shouts; they gave themselves the air of tremendous warriors. Julien stood  spellbound in admiration; he was thinking of the vastness and splendour of a  great capital like Besancon. He felt that he could not possibly summon up  courage to ask for a cup of coffee from one of those gentlemen with the proud  gaze who were marking the score at billiards.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大厅里正在进行两场台球赛。侍役们喊着点数，玩球的人围着桌子跑来跑去，周围挤满观众。一股股烟从所有的人的嘴里喷出，把他们裹在蓝色的云雾中。这些人高大的身躯，笨重的举动，浓密的颊髯，裹在身上的长长的礼服，都吸引着于连的注意。这些古代Bisontium的子孙们一说话就嚷嚷，做出一副纠纠武夫的样子。于连看得呆了，他满脑子装的都是像贝藏松这样一个大都会的宏伟和壮丽，他一点勇气也没有了，连向那些目光高傲喊着台球点数的先生们要一杯咖啡都不敢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  the young lady behind the counter had remarked the charming appearance of this  young country cousin, who, brought to a standstill three paces from the stove,  hugging his little bundle under his arm, was studying the bust of the King, in  gleaming white plaster. This young lady, a strapping FrancComtoise, extremely  well made, and dressed in the style calculated to give tone to a cafe, had already  said twice, in a low voice so modulated that only Julien should hear her: 'Sir!  Sir!' Julien's gaze met that of a pair of the most tender blue eyes, and saw  that it was himself who was being addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>然而，柜台里面的那位小姐早已注意到这位年轻乡绅迷人的面庞，他此刻正站在离炉子三步远的地方，臂下夹着一个小包裹，端详着用白石膏制成的国王胸像。这位小姐是个高高的弗朗什—孔奉人，身材极好，穿着打扮足以为一间咖啡馆生色，她已经用只想让于连一个人听见的声音轻轻喊了两遍：“先生！先生！”于连看见一双极温柔的蓝色大眼睛，原来叫的正是他。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  stepped briskly up to the counter and the pretty girl, as he might have  advanced in the face of the enemy. As he executed this great movement, his  bundle fell to the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他急忙走近柜台和那漂亮站娘，仿佛向敌人冲锋似地。他的动作太大，包裹掉了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>What  pity will not our provincial inspire in the young scholars of Paris, who at  fifteen, have already learned how to enter a cafe with so distinguished an air!  But these children, so stylish at fifteen, at eighteen begin to turn common.  The passionate shyness which one meets in the provinces now and then overcomes  itself, and then teaches its victim to desire. As he approached this beautiful  girl who had deigned to speak to him, 'I must tell her the truth,' thought  Julien, who was growing courageous by dint of his conquered shyness.'Madame,  I have come for the first time in my life to Besancon; I should like to have,  and to pay for, a roll of bread and a cup of coffee.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>我们的这位外省人会引起巴黎的年轻中学生们怎样的怜悯啊，他们十五岁上就已知道气概非凡地进咖啡馆了。然而，这些孩子尽管十五岁  上那么老练，到了十八岁却转向平庸。人们在外省看到的那种充满激情的胆怯有时却能得到克服，这时，它就会教人有志气。于连走近那位如此美丽的站娘。“我得跟她说真话，”他想。于连战胜了胆怯，变得勇敢了。“夫人，我生平第一次来贝藏松；我很想要一片面包和一杯咖啡，我付钱。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  girl smiled a little and then blushed; she feared, for this good-looking young  man, the satirical attention and witticisms of the billiard players. He would  be frightened and would never show his face there again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>小姐嫣然一笑，随即脸红了；她害怕那些打台球的人会拿这漂亮的小伙子打哈哈开玩笑。他要是给吓着了就不来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sit  down here, near me,' she said, and pointed to a marble table, almost entirely  hidden by the enormous mahogany counter which protruded into the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您坐在这儿，靠近我，”她指着一张大理石桌子说，这张桌子差不多完全被突出在大厅中的巨大的桃花心木柜台遮住。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  young woman leaned over this counter, which gave her an opportunity to display  a superb figure. Julien observed this; all his ideas altered. The pretty girl  had just set before him a cup, some sugar and a roll of bread. She hesitated  before calling to a waiter for coffee, realizing that on the arrival of the  said waiter her private conversation with Julien would be at an end.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>小姐朝柜台外俯下身，这使她有机会展开她那美妙的躯体。于连注意到了，他全部的想法顿时改变。美丽的小姐在他面前放了一只杯子、  糖、一小块面包。她拿不定主意是否叫一个侍者来倒咖啡，她知道侍者一来，她和于连的单独谈话便告结束。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  lost in thought, was comparing this fair and sprightly beauty with certain  memories which often stirred him. The thought of the passion of which he had  been the object took from him almost all his timidity. The pretty girl had only  a moment; she read the expression in Julien's eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连陷入沉思，比较着这位快活的金发美人和常常使他激动的某些回忆。他想到他曾经成为对象的那种激情，他的胆怯几乎被一扫而光。美丽的小姐不多时便在于连的目光中看出他的心思。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  pipe smoke makes you cough, come to breakfast tomorrow before eight o'clock; at  that time, I am almost alone.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“烟斗冒出的烟呛得您咳嗽，明天早晨八点钟以前来吃饭吧，那时候差不多只我一个人。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  is your name?' said Julien, with the caressing smile of happy timidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您叫什么？”于连问，温柔的微笑中带着恰到好处的羞怯。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Amanda  Binet.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“阿芒达·比奈。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Will  you permit me to send you, in an hour's time, a little parcel no bigger than  this?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您允许我一个钟头以后给您寄送一个跟这个一样的包裹吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  fair Amanda reflected for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>美丽的阿芒达想了想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am watched: what you ask may compromise me; however, I am now going to write  down my address upon a card, which you can attach to your parcel. Send it to me  without fear.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有人监视我，您要求我做的事可能会连累我；不过，我把我的地址写在一张纸片上，您贴在包裹上。大胆地寄给我吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  name is Julien Sorel,' said the young man. 'I have neither family nor friends  in Besancon.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我叫于连·索莱尔，”年轻人说，“我在贝藏松既没有亲戚，也没有熟人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Now I understand,' she exclaimed joyfully, 'you have come for the law school?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！我明白了，”她高兴地说，“您是来上法律学校的？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Alas,  no!' replied Julien; 'they are sending me to the Seminary.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“唉！不是，”于连答道，“人家送我进神学院。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  most complete discouragement extinguished the light in Amanda's features; she  called a waiter: she had the necessary courage now. The waiter poured out  Julien's coffee, without looking at him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿芒达的脸色变了，蒙上一重最彻底的失望；她叫来一位侍者：她现在不害怕了。侍者给于连倒咖啡，看都不看他一眼。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amanda  was taking money at the counter; Julien prided himself on having ventured to  speak to her: there was a dispute in progress at one of the billiard tables.  The shouts and contradictions of the players, echoing through that vast hall,  made a din which astonished Julien.Amanda  was pensive and did not raise her eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿芒达在柜台收款；于连很得意，他居然敢说话了；这时，一张台球桌上吵起来了。打台球的人的争吵和抗辩声在大厅里回荡，嘈嘈杂杂  响成一片，使于连感到惊奇。阿芒达不知想到哪里去了，垂下了眼睛。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  you like, Mademoiselle,' he said to her suddenly with assurance, 'I can say  that I am your cousin.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果您愿意，小姐，”于连突然很自信地说，“我就说我是您的表弟。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  little air of authority delighted Amanda. This is no good-for-nothing young  fellow,' she thought. She said to him very quickly, without looking at him, for  her eye was occupied in watching whether anyone were approaching the counter:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这小小的专断神气，正中阿芒达的意。“这不是一个微不足道的年轻人呀。”她想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  come from Genlis, near Dijon; say that you are from Genlis too, and my mother's  cousin.'</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'I  shall not forget.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我记住了。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'On  Thursdays, at five o'clock, in summer, the young gentlemen from the Seminary  come past the cafe here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“夏天，每星期四、五点钟，神学院的先生们从咖啡馆门前走过。</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>'If  you are thinking of me, when I pass, have a bunch of violets in your hand.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果您还想看我，我经过的时候，您手里就拿着一束紫色茧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amanda  gazed at him with an air of astonishment; this gaze changed Julien's courage  into temerity; he blushed deeply, however, as he said to her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿芒达惊奇地望着他，她的目光把于连的勇敢变成了鲁莽；不过，他说话的时候还是大红着脸：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  feel that I love you with the most violent love.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我感觉到我是用最强烈的爱情爱着您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Don't  speak so loud, then,' she warned him with an air of alarm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说话小点声呀，”她对他说，很害怕的样子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  thought of trying to recollect the language of an odd volume of the Nouvelle  Heloise, which he had found at Vergy. His memory served him well; he had been  for ten minutes reciting the Nouvelle Heloise to Miss Amanda, who was in  ecstasies; he was delighted with his own courage, when suddenly the fair  Franc-Comtoise assumed a glacial air.One  of her admirers stood in the doorway of the cafe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连在韦尔吉找到过一卷不成套的《新爱洛缔斯》，他想回忆起里面的句子。他的记忆力很好使，他对着心醉神迷的阿芒达背了十分钟的  《新爱洛缔斯》，正当他对自己的勇敢感到高兴的时候，美丽的弗朗什—孔泰姑娘的脸突然变得冷若冰霜。她的一个情夫出现在咖啡馆门口。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  came up to the counter, whistling and swaying his shoulders; he stared at  Julien. For the moment, the latter's imagination, always flying to extremes,  was filled entirely with thoughts of a duel. He turned deadly pale, thrust away  his cup, assumed an air of assurance and studied his rival most attentively.  While this rival's head was lowered as he familiarly poured himself out a glass  of brandy upon the counter, with a glance Amanda ordered Julien to lower his  gaze. He obeyed, and for a minute or two sat motionless in his place, pale,  determined, and thinking only of what was going to happen; he was really fine  at that moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他吹着口哨，晃着肩膀，走近柜台看了于连一眼。于连的想象力总是走极端，此刻只装着决斗的念头。他的脸煞白，推开杯子，显出一副坚定的神情，十分专注地看着他的情敌。那情敌低下头，随意在柜台上倒了一杯烧酒。阿芒达使了个眼色，命令于连也垂下眼睛。他服从了。他原地不动，足有两分钟，脸色苍白，神态果决，一心只想着将要发生的事；此时的于连的确很出色。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  rival had been astonished by Julien's eyes; his glass of brandy drained at a  gulp, he said a few words to Amanda, thrust his hands into the side pockets of  his ample coat, and made his way to one of the billiard tables, breathing  loudly and staring at Julien. The latter sprang to his feet in a transport of  rage; but did not know what action to take to be insulting. He laid down his  little bundle and, with the most swaggering gait that he could assume, strode  towards the billiard table.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那情敌对于连的眼睛感到惊奇，他一口喝干那杯酒，跟阿芒达说了句话，把手插进宽大的礼服两侧的口袋里，走近一张台球桌，一边还喘着粗气，看了于连一眼。于连大怒，站了起来，可是他不知道要显得傲慢无礼该怎么做。他放下小包裹，尽量地大摇大摆，走近那张台球桌。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  vain did prudence warn him: 'With a duel on the day of your arrival at  Besancon, your career in the church is gone for ever.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>谨慎对他说：“刚到贝藏松就决斗，教士的职业算完了。”然而没有用。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  does that matter, it shall never be said that I quailed before an insult.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“管它呢，日后不会有人说我放过了一个无礼之徒。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amanda  observed his courage; it formed a charming contrast with the simplicity of his  manners; in an instant, she preferred him to the big young man in the long  coat. She rose, and, while appearing to be following with her eyes the  movements of someone going by in the street, took her place swiftly between him  and the billiard table.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿芒达看见了他的勇敢；这勇敢和他举止的天真适成有趣的对照；一时间她喜欢他更甚于那个穿礼服的高个子青年。她站了起来，一边还  装作眼盯着街上走过的一个人。迅速地站在他和台球桌之间。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are not to look askance at that gentleman; he is my brother in-law.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别斜着眼看这位先生，他是我姐夫。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  do I care? He looked at me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这与我何干，他看了我。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you wish to get me into trouble? No doubt, he looked at you, perhaps he will  even come up and speak to you. I have told him that you are one of my mother's  family and that you have just come from Genlis.He  is a Franc-Comtois and has never been farther than Dole, on the road into  Burgundy; so tell him whatever you like, don't be afraid.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您想让我难过吗？的确，他看了您，也许他还要过来跟您说话呢。我刚才跟他说您是我母亲那边的亲戚，从让利来。他是弗朗什—孔泰  人，在这条勃民第大路上，他从来没有去过比多尔更远的地方；因此您想说什么就说什么，不必害怕。”</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  continued to hesitate; she added rapidly, her barmaid's imagination supplying  her with falsehoods in abundance:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连还在犹豫；站柜台的女人所具有的想象力给她提供了大量的谎言，她又补充道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  dare say he did look at you, but it was when he was asking me who you were; he  is a man who is rude with everyone, he didn't mean to insult you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他是看了您，可那是在他向我打听您的时候；他是一个对谁都粗鲁无礼的人，他不是存心侮辱您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  eye followed the alleged brother in-law; he saw him buy a number for the game  of pool which was beginning at the farther of the two billiard tables. Julien  heard his loud voice exclaim: 'I volunteer!' He passed nimbly behind Miss  Amanda's back and took a step towards the billiard table. Amanda seized him by  the arm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连的眼睛随着那个所谓的姐夫，  看见他买了一个号码牌，到两张球桌中较远的那一张上去玩。于连听见他那粗嗓门气势汹汹地喊道：“我来开球。”他急忙绕到阿芒达小姐身后，朝台球桌走了一步。阿芒达抓住他的胳膊：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Come  and pay me first,' she said to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先把钱付给我，”她对他说。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Quite  right,' thought Julien; 'she is afraid I may leave without paying.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“是的，”于连想，“她怕我不付钱就走。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amanda  was as greatly agitated as himself, and had turned very red; she counted out  his change as slowly as she could, repeating to him in a whisper as she did so:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>阿芒达跟他一样激动，满脸通红；她尽可能慢地给他找钱，反复地低声说：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Leave  the cafe this instant, or I shan't like you anymore; I do like you, though,  very much.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“立刻离开咖啡馆，否则我就不爱您了；其实我是很爱您的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  did indeed leave, but slowly. 'Is it not incumbent upon me,' he repeated to  himself, 'to go and stare at that rude person in my turn, and breathe in his  face?' This uncertainty detained him for an hour on the boulevard, outside the  cafe; he watched to see if his man came out. He did not however appear, and  Julien withdrew.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连确实出去了，但是慢慢悠悠的。“我也喘着粗气盯着这个粗鲁的家伙看，”他反复对自已说，“这难道不是我的责任吗？”他拿不定  主意，在咖啡馆前的大街上转了一个钟头；他看那人是不是出来。那人没有露面，于连也就走了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  had been but a few hours in Besancon, and already he had something to regret.  The old Surgeon-Major had long ago, notwithstanding his gout, taught him a few  lessons in fencing; this was all the science that Julien could place at the  service of his anger. But this embarrassment would have been nothing if he had  known how to pick a quarrel otherwise than by striking a blow; and, if they had  come to fisticuffs, his rival, a giant of a man, would have beaten him and left  him discomfited.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他到了贝藏松才几个钟头，就已经有了一桩懊悔的事了。那位老军医不顾身患风湿病，曾经给他上过几次剑术课，这是于连可以用来发泄怒气的全部本领。假使他知道除了打耳光还有别的方式表示生气的话，剑术欠佳也就没什么了；万一动起拳头，他的情敌是个庞然大物，肯定会把他揍一顿并打翻在地的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  a poor devil like me,' thought Julien, 'without protectors and without money,  there will be no great difference between a Seminary and a prison; I must leave  my lay clothes in some inn, where I can put on my black coat. If I ever succeed  in escaping from the Seminary for an hour or two, I can easily, in my lay  clothes, see Miss Amanda again.' This was sound reasoning; but Julien, as he  passed by all the inns in turn, had not the courage to enter any of them.</p>

<p>“对于像我这样的可怜虫来说，”于连心想，“没有保护人，没有钱，神学院和监狱区别不大。我得把我的便装存在某个旅馆里，然后穿上黑衣服。万一我能离开神学院几个钟头，我可以穿上便装去会阿芒达小姐。”于连想得挺美，可是他走过所有的旅馆，一家也不敢进。</p>

<p>Finally,  as he came again to the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, his roving gaze met that of a  stout woman, still reasonably young, with a high complexion, a happy and gay  expression. He went up to her and told her his story.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最后，他再次走到大使饭店门前，他的不安的眼睛碰上了一个胖女人的眼睛，这女人还相当年轻，肤色鲜丽，神情幸福而快活。他走近她，讲了他的事情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Certainly,  my fine young priest,' the landlady of the Ambassadeurs said to him, 'I shall  keep your lay clothes for you, indeed I will have them brushed regularly. In  this weather, it is a mistake to leave a broad cloth coat lying.' She took a  key and led him herself to a bedroom, advising him to write down a list of what  he was leaving behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“当然可以，我漂亮的小神甫，”大使饭店的老板娘对他说，“我保存您的便装，还经常掸掸灰尘。这样的天气，把一件毛料衣服扔在那儿不管，那可不行。”她拿起一把钥匙，亲自带他到一个房间里，让他把留下的东西写一个清单。</p>

<p>'Lord,  how nice you look like that, M. l'abbe Sorel,' said the stout woman, when he  came down to the kitchen. 'I am going to order you a good dinner; and,' she  added in an undertone, 'it will only cost you twenty sous, instead of the fifty  people generally pay; for you must be careful with your little purse.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“仁慈的天主，索莱尔先生，您的气色真好啊，”于连下楼走向厨房时，胖女人对他说，“我去给您准备一顿好饭菜，而且，”她又低声说，“别人都付五十苏，您只要付二十苏；因为您得好好照顾您那小钱袋啊。”，</p>

</div></div>

<p>'I  have ten louis,' retorted Julien with a certain note of pride.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我有十个路易，”于连有点儿得意地答道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  good Lord!' replied the good landlady in alarm, 'do not speak so loud; there  are plenty of bad folk in Besancon. They will have that out of you in less than  no time. Whatever you do, never go into the cafes, they are full of rogues.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！仁慈的天主：“善良的老板娘警觉起来，“别这么大声说话，贝藏松坏人多的是。一转眼就会让人偷去的。特别是绝不能进咖啡馆  ，那里面尽是坏人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indeed!'  said Julien, to whom this last statement gave food for thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真的！”于连说，老板娘的话引起他深思。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never  go anywhere except to me, I will give you your coffee. Bear inmind that you  will always find a friend here and a good dinner for twenty sous; that's good  enough for you, I hope. Go and sit down at the table, I am going to serve you  myself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别的地方别去，就到我这儿，我给您煮咖啡。记住，您永远可以在这儿找到一个朋友和一顿二十苏的好饭菜；我想，这就说定了。去吃  饭吧，我亲自伺候您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should not be able to eat,' Julien told her. 'I am too much excited, I am going  to enter the Seminary as soon as I leave here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我吃不下了，”于连对她说，“我太感动了，出了您的门我就要进神学院了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  good woman would not allow him to leave until she had stuffed his pockets with  provisions. Finally Julien set out for the dread spot, the landlady from her  doorstep pointing out the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>善良的女人把他的口袋塞满食物才放他走。终于，于连朝那个可怕的地方走去；老板娘站在门口，给他指路。
