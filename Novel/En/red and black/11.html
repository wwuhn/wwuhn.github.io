<p>Yet Julia's  very coldness still was kind, And tremulously gentle her small hand Withdrew  itself from his, but left behind A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland And  slight, so very slight, that to the mind Twas but a doubt.</p>
<p>Don Juan, I. 71</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>可是朱丽亚的冷淡也是和善的，她的发颤的纤手从他的手中温柔地缩开，但是留在后面的，是令人心惊的轻轻一压，那么温柔而飘忽，那么十分地飘忽，对于心灵只是一个捉摸不定。</p>

<p>He must, however, let himself be seen at Verrieres. As he left the  Presbytery the first person he met was, by a happy chance, M. Valenod,whom he  hastened to inform of the increase in his salary.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>总得在维里埃露面啊。碰巧，于连出了本堂神甫住宅，就遇见庄勒诺先生，连忙把加薪的事告诉他。</p>

<p>On his return to Vergy, Julien did not go down to the garden until night  had set in. His heart was worn out by the multitude of powerful emotions that  had assailed it in the course of the day. 'What shall I say to them?' he asked  himself anxiously, thinking of the ladies. It never occurred to him that his  spirits were precisely at the level of the trivial happenings that as a rule  occupy the whole interest of women. Often Julien was unintelligible to Madame  Derville, and even to her friend, while he in turn only half understood all  that they were saying to him. Such was the effect of the force, and, if I may  use the word, of the magnitude of the waves of passion on which the heart of  this ambitious youth was being tossed. In this strange creature almost every  day was one of storm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

  
<p>回到韦尔吉，于连等到天完全黑了才下楼到花园里去。他的精神一整天里受到那么多强烈感情的冲击，觉得疲惫不堪。“我对她们说些什么呢？”他想到两位夫人，心里忐忑不安。他根本看不出，他的精神状态正处在女人通常最关心的那些琐碎小事的水平上。德尔维夫人，甚至她的女友，常常不理解于连说些什么，而于连对她俩的话也只是一半懂一半不懂。这是力量所造成的结果，而且我敢说，那是激动着这个年轻野心家心灵的那些热情的强烈冲动所具有的力量。在这个怪人的心中，几乎每天都有暴风雨。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When he went into the garden that evening, Julien was ready to  listen with interest to the thoughts of the fair cousins. They awaited his  coming with impatience. He took his accustomed seat, by Madame de Renal's side.  The darkness soon became intense. He attempted to clasp a white hand which for  some time he had seen close beside him, resting on the back of a chair. There  was some hesitation shown, but finally the hand was withdrawn from him in a  manner which betokened displeasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这天晚上，于连走进花园，打算听听这一对表姐妹的看法，她们正焦急地等着他呢。他在老地方坐下，挨着德·莱纳夫人。夜色很快转浓。他老早就看见一只白皙的手，搭在椅背上，就在他旁边，他真想握住。她犹豫了一下，还是从他手里把手抽了回去，像是生气了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien was prepared to regard this as final, and to continue the  conversation in a light tone, when he heard M. de Renal approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>于连准备就这样算了，继续愉快的谈话，这时他听见德·莱纳先生走近了。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The rude words of the morning still rang in Julien's ears. 'Would it  not,' he said to himself, 'be a good way of scoring off this creature, so  lavishly endowed with every material advantage, to take possession of his wife's  hand under his very eyes? Yes, I will do it, I, for whom he has shown such  contempt.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连的耳畔还响着早上的那些粗鲁的话。“这家伙占尽了财富带来的种种好处，”他心想，“若正好当着他的面占有她妻子的手，不是嘲笑他的一种方式吗？对，我一定要这么做，他曾经对我表示出那么大的轻蔑。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>From that moment peace of mind, so ill assorted to Julien's  character,speedily vanished; he desired most anxiously, and without being able  to fix his mind on anything else, that Madame de Renal might consent to let him  hold her hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>从这时候起，于连的性格中原本就少有的那种内心的平静，很快便离他而去；他什么也不能想，只惶惶然希望德·莱纳夫人愿意让他握着她的手。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>M. de Renal talked politics in an angry tone: two or three  manufacturers at Verrieres were becoming decidedly richer than himself, and wished  to oppose him at the elections. Madame Derville listened to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳先生愤愤地谈开了政治：维里埃有两、三个工业家肯定变得比他有钱了，想使他在选举中受挫。德尔维夫人听着。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien, irritated by this talk, moved his chair nearer to Madame de Renal's.  The darkness hid every movement. He ventured to place his hand close to the  pretty arm which her gown left bare. Troubled, no longer conscious of what he  was doing, he moved his cheek in the direction of this pretty arm, and made  bold to press his lips to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连对他的长篇大论感到恼火，把椅子挪近德·莱纳夫人的椅子。黑夜掩盖着一切动作。他大着胆子，把手放在离那只衣服没有掩住的美丽的胳膊很近的地方。他心慌意乱，神不守舍，胆大包天，竟把脸颊挨近这只美丽的胳膊，在上面印上他的嘴唇。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Madame de Renal shuddered. Her husband was a few feet away, she hastened  to give Julien her hand, at the same time thrusting him slightly from her.  While M. de Renal continued his abuse of the good-for-nothings and Jacobins who  were making fortunes, Julien covered the hand which had been left in his with  passionate kisses, or so at least they seemed to Madame de Renal. And yet the  poor woman had been furnished with proof, on this fatal day, that the heart of  the man whom she adored without confessing it was pledged elsewhere! Throughout  the hours of Julien's absence, she had been a prey to the most abject misery,which  had made her think.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人不觉一震。他的丈夫就在四步之外，她赶紧把手给了于连，同时把他稍稍推开一点。正当德·莱纳先主继续咒骂那些发了财的无耻之徒和雅各宾党人，于连却在那只手上印满热情的吻，至少德·莱纳夫人觉得是热情的。然而，这可怜的女人就在昨天那个要命的日子里有了证据，这个她爱慕但并未承认的男人爱着别人！在于连离开的那段时间里，她一直在一种极端的不幸中煎熬，她开始思考了。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'What,' she said to herself, 'am I to love, to have love offered to  me? Am I, a married woman, to fall in love? But,' she reminded herself, 'I have  never felt that dark passion for my husband, and so I cannot tear my mind from  Julien. At heart he is only a boy filled with respect for me! This folly will  pass. How can it concern my husband what feelings I may entertain for this  young man? M. de Renal would be bored by the talks I have with Julien, about  things of the imagination. He himself thinks only about his business. I am  taking nothing from him to give to Julien.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“什么！我是在爱吗？”她对自己说，“我是有了爱情？我，一个结了婚的女人，我在恋爱！但是我从未对我的丈夫体验过这种不明不白的疯狂，这使我老是想着于连。其实，他不过是个对我充满敬意的孩子呀！这种疯狂很快就会过去的。我可以对这个年轻人怀有的感情关我丈夫什么事！我跟于连净聊些空想的事情，德·菜纳先生还可能会感到厌烦呢。他嘛，他想的是他的事务。我并没有从他那里夺走什么送给于连。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>No trace of hypocrisy came to sully the purity of this simple soul,  carried away by a passion such as she had never felt. She was deceived, but quite  unawares, and at the same time a virtuous instinct had taken alarm. Such were  the conflicts that were agitating her when Julien appeared in the garden. She  heard his voice, almost at the same moment she saw him sit down by her side.  Her heart was so to speak carried away by this charming happiness which for the  last fortnight had astonished even more than it had bewitched her. Everything  was unexpected to her. And yet after a few moments: 'So Julien's presence is  enough,' she said to herself, 'to wipe out all memory of his misconduct?' She  took fright; then it was that she withdrew her hand from his.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她被一称从未体验过的热情弄得昏了头，但是并没有任何的虚伪来玷污她那天真无邪的心灵的纯洁。她是错了，可自己并不知道，不过，一种维护贞操的本能已被惊醒。于连出现在花园时，她正心神不宁，脑海里翻腾着这样的斗争。她听见他说话，几乎就在同时，她看见他坐在了身旁。两个礼拜以来，一种迷人的幸福就诱惑着她，但更使她惊奇，此刻她的心灵简直被它卷走了。对她来说，一切都不可预料。然而，过了一会儿，她想：“难道于连的在场就足以勾销他的一切过错吗？”她吓坏了，就在这时她抽回了手。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His kisses, filled with passion and such as she had never yet  received,made her at once forget the possibility of his loving another woman.Soon he was no longer guilty in her eyes. The cessation of her  poignant grief, born of suspicion, the presence of a happiness of which she had  never even dreamed, plunged her in transports of affection and wild gaiety.  That evening was delightful for them all, except for the Mayor of Verrieres,  who could not forget the growing wealth of his competitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这些充满热情的吻，这样的吻她还从来没有接受过，使她一下子忘了他也许正爱着另一个女人。很快，他在她眼中不再是应该受到谴责的了。一种由怀疑产生的剜心的痛苦中止了，一个她作梦都想不到的男人就在眼前，这给她带来了爱情的激奋和疯狂的欢乐。这个晚上人人都过得很愉快，只有维里埃的市长例外，他一直对他那几个发了财的工业家耿耿于怀。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien no longer thought of his dark ambition, nor of his plans that  would be so difficult of execution. For the first time in his life, he was carried away by the power of beauty. Lost in a vague and pleasant dream, so foreign  to his nature, gently pressing that hand which pleased him as an example of  perfect beauty, he gave a divided attention to the rustle of the leaves of the  lime, stirred by the gentle night breeze, and to the dogs at the mill by the  Doubs, barking in the distance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连不再想他那愤怒的野心了，也不再想他那些如此难以实施的计划了。他生平第一次受到美的力量左右。他沉浸在一种与他的性格如此不合的、模糊而甜蜜的梦幻之中，轻轻地揉捏着那只因极好看而惹他怜爱的手，恍恍惚惚地听着，那棵椴树的叶子在夜晚的微风中沙沙作响，远处杜河磨房中有几条狗在吠叫。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But this emotion was a pleasure and not a passion. On returning to  his room he thought of one happiness only, that of going on with his favourite  book; at twenty, the thought of the world and of the impression one is going to  make on it, prevails over everything else.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>然而，这种感觉是一种愉悦，并不是一种热情。他一回到卧房，就只想到一种幸福了，即拿起他心爱的书；一个人在二十岁的时候，他对世界的看法以及他对他将在这个世界上产生的影响的看法，胜过其余的一切。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Presently, however, he put down the book. By dint of dreaming of Napoleon's  victories, he had discerned a new element in his own. 'Yes, I have won a  battle,' he told himself, 'but I must follow it up, I must crush the arrogance  of this proud gentleman while he is still retreating. That is Napoleon out and  out. I must ask him for three days' holiday, to go and see my friend Fouque. If  he refuses, I again offer to break the agreement;but he will give way.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不过他很快把书放下，他想着拿破仑的胜利，想啊想，终于在自己的胜利中看出某种新的东西。“是的，我打了一个胜仗，”他对自已说，“但是应该乘胜追击，应该在这个自负的绅士退却的时候粉碎他的傲气。这才是纯粹拿破仑的作风。我得请三天假去看我的朋友富凯。如果他拒绝，我就再次逼他立即作出抉择，不过他会让步的。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal could not close an eye. She felt that she had never lived  until that moment. She could not tear her mind from the happiness of feeling  Julien cover her hand with burning kisses.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·菜纳夫人合不上眼了。她觉得到目前为止她简直没有生活过。感觉到于连印满她的手的那些火热的吻，这是一种幸福，她不能不去想。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Suddenly the horrid word adultery occurred to her. All the most  disgusting implications that the vilest debauchery can  impart to the idea of sensual love came crowding into her imagination. These  ideas sought to tarnish the tender and godlike image that she had made for  herself of Julien and of the pleasure of loving him. The future portrayed  itself in terrible colours. She saw herself an object of scorn.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最下流的放荡能够加在感官之爱这观念上的形形色色令人作呕的东西纷纷涌进她的想象之中。这些想法竭力要玷污她为于连、为爱他的幸福勾画出的那个温柔而神圣的形象。未来被用可怕的色彩画了出来。她看见自己成了一个令人鄙视的女人。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was a frightful moment; her soul journeyed into strange lands.  That evening she had tasted an unknown happiness; now she suddenly found herself  plunged in appalling misery. She had no conception of such sufferings; they  began to affect her reason. The thought occurred to her for a moment of  confessing to her husband that she was afraid of falling in love with Julien.  It would have allowed her to speak of him. Fortunately she recalled a piece of  advice given her long ago by her aunt, on the eve of her marriage. It warned  her of the danger of confiding in a husband,who is after all a master. In the  intensity of her grief she wrung her hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时刻真可怕，她的灵魂连自己也陌生了。刚才她还尝到一种未曾体验过的幸福，现在一下子就沉入一种难以忍受的不幸之中。她对这样的痛苦全然不知，她的理智被搅乱了。她有一阵想向丈夫承认她怕是爱上了于连。这倒可以谈一谈他了。幸好她想起了结婚前夕姑母给她的一个忠告，说的是向丈夫讲心里话的危险，因为说到底，丈夫究竟是个主人。她在极度的痛苦中绞着自己的手。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>She was carried away <a href="#" title="[ˌɪndɪ'skrɪmɪnətlɪ]
    adv.不加区别地；过分">indiscriminately</a> by  conflicting and painful imaginings. At one moment she was afraid of not being  loved in return, at another the fearful thought of the crime tortured her as  though on the morrow she would have to be exposed in the <a href="#" title="美 ['pɪləri]英 ['pɪləri]

</div>
<div class="right">


<p>她由着一些相互矛盾又令人痛苦的景象任意摆布。她时而担心自己没有被爱，时而犯罪的念头又折磨着她，仿佛第二天就要被拉到维里埃的广场上去示众，还要挂着一块牌子，上面写的字向老百姓说明她的通奸罪。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Madame de Renal was without any experience of life; even when wide awake  and in the full exercise of her reason, she would have seen no distinction  between being guilty in the sight of God and finding herself publicly greeted  with all the most flagrant marks of general <a href="#" title="美 [ə'proʊbriəm]英 [ə'prəʊbriəm]

<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人对人生没有丝毫经验，在天主眼中有罪和当众对她最激烈地表示普遍的蔑视，她看不出这两者之间有任何的距离。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
	
<p>When  the frightful idea of adultery and of all the ignominy which (she supposed)  that crime brings in its train gave her at length a <a href="#" title="美 ['respɪt]英 ['respaɪt]
    n.喘息；暂停；暂缓；短暂的延缓
    v.缓期执行(死刑)；使缓和一下；【军】停付(军人)薪饷；停付(薪金)">respite</a>, and she began to  dream of the delight of living with Julien innocently, as in the past, she  found herself swept away by the horrible thought that Julien was in love with  another woman. She saw once again his pallor when he was afraid of losing her  portrait, or of compromising her by letting it be seen. For the first time, she  had surprised signs of fear on that calm and noble countenance. Never had he  shown himself in such a state for her or for her children. This additional  grief carried her to the utmost intensity of anguish which the human soul is  able to endure. Unconsciously, Madame de Renal uttered cries which roused her  maid. Suddenly she saw appear by her bedside the light of a lamp, and  recognised Elisa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>她想到通奸，想到她认为必将随着这桩罪行而来的种种耻辱，当这可怕的念头终于让她喘口气的时候，甚至当她终于能想到像过去一样天真无邪地和于连一起生活的甜蜜的时候，她发现自己又被抛进于连爱着别的女人这个骇人的想法里。于连害怕丢失这女人的肖像或者害怕因让人看见而连累她时的那种苍白的脸色，至今仍宛然如在目前。这是她第一次在这张如此平静、如此高贵的脸上发现了恐惧。他从来也不曾为了她或她的孩子们表现出如此的激动。这一新的痛苦达到了人类心灵所能承受的最大不幸的强度。德·莱纳夫人在不知不觉中竞叫了起来，惊醒了女仆。她突然看见床边亮起了灯光，认出是爱丽莎。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Is it you that he loves?' she cried in her frenzy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“他爱的是您吗？”她在狂热中喊道。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The maid, amazed at the fearful distress in which she found her  mistress, paid no attention fortunately to this singular utterance. Madame de Renal  realised her own imprudence: 'I am feverish,' she told her, 'and I think, a  little light-headed; stay beside me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>女仆没想到女主人会陷入这样可怕的慌乱之中，大吃一惊，幸好她根本就没注意这句怪异的话。德·莱纳夫人察觉到说漏了嘴，便说：“我在发烧，大概说胡话了，您就留在我身边吧。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Thoroughly awakened by the necessity of controlling herself, she  felt less wretched; reason resumed the sway of which her state of drowsiness had  deprived it. To escape from the fixed stare of her maid, she ordered her to  read the newspaper aloud, and it was to the monotonous sound of the girl's  voice, reading a long article from the Quotidienne, that Madame de Renal formed  the virtuous resolution to treat Julien with absolute coldness when next she  saw him.</p></div>
  <div class="right">
  <p>她必须克制，也就完全清醒了，她觉得自己的不幸减轻了些；半睡半醒的状态使她失去了理智，现在理智又恢复了控制。为了摆脱女仆的注视，她吩咐她读报。女仆读《每日新闻》上的一篇长文，在这姑娘的单调的声音中，德·莱纳夫人下定决心维护她的贞洁，再见到于连时，要表现出完全的冷淡。</p>
