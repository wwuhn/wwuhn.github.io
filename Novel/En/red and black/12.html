  <div class="left"><p>Next morning, at five o'clock, before Madame de Renal was visible,Julien  had obtained from her husband three days' leave of absence. Contrary to his  expectation, Julien found himself longing to see her again,and could think of  nothing but that shapely hand. He went down to the garden, Madame de Renal was  long in coming. But if Julien had been in love with her he would have seen her,  behind her half-closed shutters on the first floor, her face pressed to the  glass. She was watching him. At length, in spite of her resolutions, she  decided to show herself in the garden. Her customary pallor had given place to  the most glowing colour. This simple-minded woman was evidently agitated: a  feeling of constraint and even of resentment marred that expression of profound  serenity, as though raised above all the common interests of life, which gave  such charm to that heavenly face.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天早晨五点钟，德·莱纳夫人还未梳妆好，于连就从她丈夫那里请准了三天假。于连没有想到，他竟渴望着见到她，他想她那只手，那么好看。他下楼进了花园，德·莱纳夫人迟迟不肯露面。但是，于连若是爱她，准会发现她站在二层楼上半开的百叶窗后面，额头抵着玻璃。她在看他。最后，决心归决心，她还是决定到花园里去。平时的苍白一变而为最鲜艳的绯红。这个那么天真的女人显然很激动，一种克制、甚至愤怒的感情使她的表情变了样，这表情平时流露出一种深沉的宁静，仿佛超脱于世间一切庸俗的利益之上，给这张天使般的脸带来如此巨大的魅力。</p>　


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien lost no time in joining her; he admired those fine arms which  a shawl flung in haste across her shoulders left visible. The coolness of the morning  air seemed to increase the brilliance of a complexion which the agitation of  the past night made all the more sensible to every impression. This beauty,  modest and touching, and yet full of thoughts which are nowhere to be found  among the lower orders, seemed to reveal to Julien an aspect of her nature of  which he had never yet been aware.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连急忙走近她，痴痴地望着她那双在匆忙围上的披肩下露出的、如此美丽的胳膊。一夜的激动只能使她的脸色更易于受到外界的影响，早晨的凉爽空气似乎使它更加光艳照人。这种端庄、动人却又笼罩在沉思中的美，在下层阶级中是根本没有的，似乎向于连揭示出她的心灵具有一种他从未感觉到的能力。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Wholly absorbed in admiration of the charms which his greedy eye  surprised, Julien was not thinking of the friendly greeting which he might expect  to receive. He was all the more astonished by the icy coldness that was shown  him, beneath which he even thought he could make out a deliberate intention to  put him in his place.</p>

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连的贪婪的目光意外地发现这种种的魅力，他目不转睛，赞赏不已，自以为他期待着的友好对待不在话下。因此，她试图向他表示的那种冰一样的冷淡就更使他感到惊讶了，他甚至还认为他从中看出一种要他勿作非份之想的意图。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The smile of pleasure faded from his lips; he remembered the rank  that he occupied in society, especially in the eyes of a noble and wealthy  heiress. In a moment, his features showed nothing but pride and anger with himself.  He felt a violent disgust at having been so foolish as to postpone his  departure by more than an hour, only to receive so humiliating agreeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>愉快的微笑从他的嘴唇上消失，他想起了他在上流社会、特别是在一个高贵而富有的女继承人眼中所处的地位。转眼间他的脸上只剩下高傲和针对自己的愤怒。他感到一种强烈的恼怒，自己居然能够把出发推迟一小时，得到的却是如此令人屈辱的对待。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Only a fool,' he told himself, 'loses his temper with other people:  a stone falls because it is heavy. Am I always to remain a boy? When am I going  to form the good habit of giving these people their exact money's worth and no  more of my heart and soul? If I wish to be esteemed by them and by myself, I  must show them that it is my poverty that deals with their wealth, but that my  heart is a thousand leagues away from their insolence, and is placed in too  exalted a sphere to be reached by their petty marks of contempt or favour.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>他想：“只有傻瓜才生别人的气，石头下落是因为它重。难道我永远是个孩子吗？什么时候我才能养成这个好习惯，我向这些人出卖灵魂仅仅是为了他们的钱？如果我想得到他们的和我自己的尊重，那就应该向他们表明，和他们的财富打交道的是我的贫穷，而我的心和他们的蛮横无礼相距千里之遥，它高高在上，他们那些轻蔑或宠信的小小表示岂能达到。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>While these sentiments came crowding into the young tutor's mind,his  features assumed an expression of injured pride and ferocity. Madame de Renal  was greatly distressed by this. The virtuous coldness which she had meant to  impart to her greeting gave way to an expression of interest, and of an  interest animated by the surprise of the sudden change which she had just  beheld in him. The flow of idle words that people exchange in the morning with  regard to one another's health, to the beauty of the day, and so forth, dried  up at once in them both. Julien,whose judgment was not disturbed by any  passion, soon found a way of letting Madame de Renal see how little he regarded  himself as being on terms of friendship with her; he said nothing to her of the  little expedition on which he was starting, bowed to her, and set off.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这些情感纷纷涌进年轻的家庭教师的心，他那张多变的脸挂上了自尊心受到伤害和冷酷的表情。德·莱纳夫人完全乱了方寸。她原来想赋与她接待时的那种贞洁的冷淡被代之以关切的表情，她刚刚看到的突然变化使她感到十分惊讶，而惊讶激起了关切。早晨见面时所说的身体好天气好之类的废话，他们俩一下子谁都说不出来了。于连，什么样的热情也扰乱不了他的判断，很快就找出一个办法向德·莱纳夫人表示，他认为他们之间的友谊关系多么微不足道；他对这次小小旅行只字未提，行了一个礼，转身便走。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As she watched him go, overwhelmed by the sombre pride which she read  in that glance, so friendly the evening before, her eldest son, who came  running up from the other end of the garden, said to her as he embraced her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她眼睁睁地看着他走了，她在他头天晚上还那么可爱的目光中看的那种阴郁的高傲把她吓呆了，这时，他的大儿子从花园深处跑来，一边拥抱她一边说：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We have a holiday, M. Julien is going on a journey.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们放假啦，于连先生出门旅行去了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At these words Madame de Renal felt herself frozen by a deadly chill;she  was unhappy in her virtue, and more unhappy still in her weakness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>听了这句话，德·莱纳夫人顿时感到周身冰凉，如同死了一样。她因其贞洁而不幸，又因其软弱而更加不幸。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This latest development now occupied the whole of her imagination; she  was carried far beyond the wise resolutions which were the fruit of the terrible  night she had passed. It was a question no longer of resisting this charming  lover, but of losing him for ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这场新的风波占据了她的全部想象力，她在刚刚度过的那个可怕的一夜里下定的那些明智的决心，都被她抛到九霄云外。现在的问题不再是抗拒这个如此可爱的情人，而是要永远地失去他了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She was obliged to take her place at table. To add to her misery, M.  de Renal and Madame Derville spoke of nothing but Julien's departure. The Mayor  of Verrieres had remarked something, unusual in the firm tone with which he had  demanded a holiday.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>吃中饭她必须到场。更令她感到痛苦的是，德·莱纳先生和德尔维夫人偏偏只谈于连的离开。维里埃的市长注意到，他请假时的强硬口吻中有一种不寻常的东西。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'The young peasant has doubtless an offer from someone in his  pocket.But that someone, even if it should be M. Valenod, must be a little  discouraged by the sum of 600 francs, which he must now be prepared to spend  annually. Yesterday, at Verrieres, he will have asked for three days in which  to think things over; and this morning, so as not to be obliged to give me an  answer, the young gentleman goes off to the mountains. To have to reckon with a  wretched workman who puts on airs,that's what we've come to!' </p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这个小乡下人的口袋里肯定有什么人的建议。不过，这什么人，哪怕是瓦勒诺先生，也不能不对这六百法郎的数目感到有点儿泄气，他现在就得预先准备出这笔款项。昨天，在维里埃，大概有人要求给三天的时间来考虑；今天早晨，为了避免非得给我一个答复不可，这位小先生就出发到山里去。不得不认真对待一个傲慢的混蛋工人，我们今天就到了这地步！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Since my husband, who does not know how deeply he has wounded Julien,  thinks he is going to leave us, what am I to suppose?' Madame de Renal asked  herself. 'Ah! It is all settled!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人暗想：“我的丈夫不知道他把于连伤害得多么深，既然他都认为于连要离开我们了，那我还有什么可想的呢？啊，一切都不可挽回了！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>So as to be able at least to weep in freedom, and without having to  answer Madame Derville's questions, she pleaded a splitting headache, and retired  to bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>为了至少能够自由地哭一场，还有为了不回答德尔维夫人的问话，她说她头疼得厉害，躺到床上去了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There you have a woman all over,' M. de Renal repeated; 'there's  always something wrong with those complicated machines.' And he went on his way  jeering.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“这就是女人呀，”德·莱纳先生又弹出他的老调，“这些复杂的机器总是有什么地方出毛病。”他嘟嘟囔囔地走了。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>While Madame de Renal was at the mercy of the most cruel inflictions of  the terrible passion into which accident had led her, Julien was making his way  light-heartedly amid the loveliest views that mountain scenery has to offer. He  was obliged to pass over the high range to the north of Vergy. The path which  he followed, rising gradually amid great beechwoods, forms an endless series of  zigzags on the side of the high mountain which bounds the valley of the Doubs  on the north. Presently the traveller's gaze, passing over the lower ridges  which confine the course of the Doubs on the south, was able to sweep the  fertile plains of Burgundy and Beaujolais. <a href="#" title="美 [ˌɪrɪ'spɒnsɪv]英 [ˌɪrɪs'pɒnsɪv]
    adj.不回答的；没有反应的
    网络无反应的；无答复的">Irresponsive</a> as the heart of this  ambitious youth might be to this kind of beauty, he could not refrain from  stopping now and again to gaze at so vast and so imposing a prospect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>偶然情况把德·莱纳夫人投入可怕的热情之中，当她经受着这种热情的最残酷的折磨之时，于连正在山区所能呈现的最美的景色中赶路。他必须穿越韦尔吉北面的大山脉。一座高山画出了杜河的谷地，他走的那条小路穿过大片大片的山毛榉林，就在这座高山的斜坡上无穷尽地曲折蜿蜒，逐渐上升。不久，旅人的目光越过拦住南下的杜河河道的那些不那么高的山丘，直达勃民第和博若莱的沃野。这位年轻野心家的心灵无论对此种类型的美多么迟钝，也禁不住要不时地停下脚步，望一望那如此广阔、如此庄严的景致。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At length he came to the summit of the high mountain, beneath which he  must pass in order to arrive, by this diagonal route, at the lonely valley in  which his friend Fouque, the young timber merchant, lived. Julien was in no  hurry to see him, or any other human being for that matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他终于到达这座高山的山顶，山顶旁边有一条近路，通向他的朋友、年轻的木材商富凯居住的那条偏僻的山谷。于连并不急于见到他，也不急于见到其他任何人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Concealed like a bird of prey, amid the bare rocks which crowned the  high mountain, he could see a long way off anyone that might be coming his way.  He discovered a small cave in the almost perpendicular face of one of the  rocks. He set his course for it, and presently was ensconced in this retreat.  'Here,' he said, his eyes sparkling with joy, 'men can do me no harm.' It  occurred to him to indulge in the pleasure of writing down his thoughts, so  dangerous to him in any other place. A smooth block of stone served as his  table. His pen flew: he saw nothing of the scene round about him. At length he  noticed that the sun was setting behind the distant mountains of Beaujolais.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>他像一只猛禽一样藏在山顶那些光秃秃的岩石中间，远远地就能看见朝他走近的人。他在一面几乎垂直的峭壁上发现一个小山洞。他飞跑几步，很快便进入洞中。“在这儿，”他说，眼睛里闪烁着快乐的光芒，“谁也伤害不了我。”他忽然心生一念，何不尽情享受一下把自己的思想写下来的乐趣，既然别的地方对他都是那样地危险。一块方石就充作桌子。他奋笔疾书，周围的一切皆视而不见。他终于注意到，太阳已经落在远离博若莱的那些大山后面了。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Why should I not spend the night here?' he asked himself; 'I have bread,  and I am free!' At the sound of that great word his heart leaped, his hypocrisy  meant that he was not free even with Fouque. His head supported on both his  hands, Julien stayed in this cave happier than he had ever been in his life,  engrossed in his dreams and in the joy of freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我何不在此过夜？”他对自己说，“我有面包，而且我是自由的！”随着这个伟大的字眼儿的声音，他的心灵兴奋起来，他的虚伪弄得他即使在富凯家里也感到不自由。他双手托着脑袋，沉浸在幻想和获得自由的幸福中，他长这么大，从未像在这个山洞里这么幸福过。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Without heeding it he saw fade and die, one after another, the last  rays of evening light. In the midst of that vast darkness, his soul wandered in  contemplation of what he imagined that he would one day find in Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他怔怔的，看着黄昏的光线一道道地消失。周围是无边的黑暗，他的心灵在沉思中乱撞，他想象有朝一日他会在巴黎遇见什么。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This was first and foremost a woman far more beautiful and of a far higher  intelligence than any it had been his lot to see in the country. He loved with  passion, he was loved in return. If he tore himself from her for a few moments,  it was to cover himself with glory and earn the right to be loved more warmly  still.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>首先是一个女人，她比他在外省年能见到的任何女人都更美，更有才华。他热烈地爱她，也为她所爱。如果他暂时离开她，那是为了去获取荣誉，为了更值得她爱。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even if we allow him Julien's imagination, a young man brought up among  the melancholy truths of Paris would have been aroused at this stage in his  romance by the cold touch of irony; the mighty deeds would have vanished with  the hope of performing them, to give place to the well-known maxim: 'When a man  leaves his mistress, he runs the risk of being betrayed two or three times  daily.' The young peasant saw no obstacle between himself and the most heroic  actions, save want of opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一个在巴黎上流社会的可悲现实中被教养成人的青年，假设他有于连的相象力，当他的幻想发展到这种地步时也会被冷酷的讽刺唤醒；壮举早已随实现的希望消失，取代它的是那句人们如此熟悉的格言：“离开情妇，唉，就有一日两、三次被骗之虞。”年轻的乡下人在他和最英勇的行为之间只看见缺乏机会，其余的什么也看不见。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But black night had succeeded the day, and he had still two leagues  to cover before coming down to the hamlet in which Fouque lived. Before leaving  the little cave, Julien struck a light and carefully destroyed all that he had  written.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>但是黑夜取代了白昼，要下到富凯居住的小村庄，他还有两法里的路要走。离开小山洞之前，于连点起火，小心地把写出的东西烧干净。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He greatly astonished his friend by knocking at his door at one  o'clock in the morning. He found Fouque engaged in making up his accounts.He was a young man of tall stature, none too well made, with large,  hard features, a huge nose, and plenty of good nature concealed beneath this repellent  aspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他凌晨一点钟敲门，朋友大吃一惊。他看到富凯正在记帐。这是一个高个子年轻人，身材相当不匀称，脸上线条粗硬，鼻子极大，但是很丑陋的外貌下藏着一颗很善良的心。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You've quarrelled with your M. de Renal, then, that you come here  of a sudden like this?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你这样突然地来找我，是和你的德·莱纳先生闹翻了吗？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien related to him, with suitable omissions, the events of the  previous evening.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连把头一天发生的那些事讲给他听，但是讲得很有分寸。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Stay with me,' Fouque said to him; 'I see that you know M. de Renal,M.  Valenod, the Sub-Prefect Maugiron, the cure Chelan; you have grasped all the  subtle points of their natures; you're ripe now to put yourself up for auction.  You know arithmetic better than I do, you shall keep my books; I am making a  big profit from my business. The impossibility of doing everything by myself  and the fear of hitting upon a rogue in the man I might take as my partner  prevent me every day from doing the most profitable deals. Not a month ago I  put six thousand francs in the pocket of Michaud of Saint Amand, whom I had not  seen for six years, and met quite by chance at the Pontarlier sale. Why should not  you have made those six thousand francs yourself, or three thousand at least?  For if I had had you with me that day, I should have gone on bidding for that  lot of timber, and the other would soon have left me with it. Be my partner.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“留在我这儿吧，”富凯对他说，“我看出你了解德·莱纳先生、瓦勒诺先生、莫吉隆专区区长和谢朗本堂神甫，你对这些人的脾气了如指掌，你已经可以参与拍卖了。你的数学比我强，你记帐，我的买卖很赚钱。我一个人顾不过来，要是找—个合伙人，又怕遇上骗子，所以每天都有些好买卖不能做。将近一个月之前，我让圣－阿芒的米肖赚了六千法郎，我有六年没见他了，是在朋塔里埃拍卖会上偶然碰上的。为什么你不能赚这六千法郎呢？至少也能赚三千呀，如果那天有你和我在一起，我会出高价承包采伐那片树的，所有的人都会让给我。做我的合伙人吧。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This offer annoyed Julien; it unsettled his erratic mind; throughout  supper, which the friends cooked for themselves, like Homeric heroes,for Fouque  lived by himself, he showed Julien his books, and proved to him what advantages  his trade in timber offered. Fouque had the highest opinion of Julien's  intelligence and character.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这个建议扰乱了于连的非非之想，使他感到不快。富凯过单身生活，于是两个朋友像荷马英雄一样自己做晚饭。吃饭的时候，富凯给他看帐本，向他证明自己的木材主意多么有利可图。富凯对于连的智慧和性格评价极高。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When at length the latter found himself alone in his little room  walled with planks of firwood, 'It is true,' he said to himself, 'I can make a  few thousand francs here, then return with advantage to the calling of soldier or  priest, according to the fashion prevailing in France at the time. The little hoard that I  shall have amassed will remove all difficulties of detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当于连终于一个人待在他那枞木小屋里的时候，他对自己说：“是啊，我可以在这里挣几千法郎，然后在有利的条件下，按照那时法国时兴的风尚，当兵或当教士。我会有一小笔钱，一切具体的困难都可一扫而光。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Alone on this mountainside, I can do something to dispel my present  appalling ignorance of so many of the things that occupy the minds of all these  fashionable gentlemen. But Fouque is giving up the thought of marriage, he has  told me again and again that solitude is making him melancholy. It is obvious  that if he is taking a partner who has no money to put into his business, it is  in the hope of providing himself with a companion who will never leave him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>孤零零地呆在山里，我可以少想些我那可怕的无知，客厅里的那些人关心的许多事我都一无所知啊。富凯不想结婚，他老是对我说孤独使他难受。很明显，如果他找一个在他的生意中没有投资的人做合伙人，是想有一个永远不离开他的伙伴。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Shall I prove false to my friend?' exclaimed Julien angrily. This creature,  for whom hypocrisy and the absence of all fellow feeling were the ordinary line  of conduct, could not on this occasion bear the thought of the slightest want  of delicacy towards a man who loved him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我会欺骗我的朋友吗？”于连生气地叫起来。这个人把虚伪和泯除—切同情心作为获得安全的通常的手段，这一次却不能容忍自己对一个爱他的人有任何有欠高尚的念头。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But all at once Julien became happy, he had a reason for refusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是，于连突然高兴起来，他有了拒绝的理由了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What, I should be idly wasting seven or eight years! I should thus  arrive at eight and twenty; but, at that age, Napoleon had already done his greatest  deeds! After I have obscurely scraped together a little money by going round  all these timber sales, and winning the favour of various minor rascals, who  can say whether I shall still preserve the sacred fire with which one makes  oneself a name?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“什么！我将怯懦地浪费七、八年的时间！那时我就二十八岁了；而在这个年纪，拿破仑己经干出了他那些最伟大的事业了，当我为了卖木头而四处奔波，还要讨得几个卑贱的骗子的欢心、终于无声无息地赚了几个钱的时候，谁能保证我还有成就功名所必需的神圣热情？”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The following morning, Julien replied with great coolness to the worthy  Fouque, who looked upon the matter of their partnership as settled, that his  vocation to the sacred ministry of the altar did not allow him to accept.  Fouque could not believe his ears.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天早晨，于连极其冷静地答复善良的富凯，说从事圣职的志向不允许他接受，富凯大为惊讶，他还以为合伙的事情说定了呢，</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But do you realise,' he kept on saying, 'that I make you my partner,  or,if you prefer, give you four thousand francs a year? And you want to go back  to your M. de Renal, who despises you like the mud on his shoes!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是你想过吗，”富凯一再对他说，“我要你做合伙人，或者你愿意，我每年给你四千法郎，而你却想回到你的莱纳先生那里去，他轻视你就似他鞋上的泥！</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When you have two hundred louis in hand, what is to prevent you from  entering the Seminary? I will say more, I undertake to procure for you the best  parish in the district. For,' Fouque went on, lowering his voice, 'I supply  firewood to the ——, and the ——, and M. ——. I give them the best quality of oak,  for which they pay me the price of white wood, but never was money better  invested.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>等你有了二百个路易时，有什么能阻止你进神学院呢？我还有呢，我负责给你弄到本地最好的本堂区。因为，”富凯放低了声音，“我向……先生、……先生、……先生供应烧柴。我给他们头等的橡木，他们只照白木的价钱付款，但这是最好的投资了。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Nothing could prevail against Julien's vocation. In the end Fouque  decided that he must be slightly mad. On the third day, at dawn, Julien left his  friend to pass the day among the rocks of the big mountain. He found his little  cave again, but he no longer enjoyed peace of mind, his friend's offers had  destroyed it.
