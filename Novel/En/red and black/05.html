  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Answer me, without lying, if you can, you miserable bookworm; how do you come to know Madame de Renal? When have you spoken to her?'

</div>
<div class="right">

“看你能老实回答我，臭书呆子；你在哪儿认识德·莱纳夫人的？你什么时候跟她说过话？”

</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I have never spoken to her,' replied Julien, 'I have never seen the lady except in church.'</p>

</div>
<div class="right">

“我从来没跟她说过话，”于连答道，“我只在教堂看见过这位夫人。”

</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'But you must have looked at her, you shameless scoundrel?'

</div>
<div class="right">

“那你是不是看她啦，不要脸的下流胚？”

</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Never! You know that in church I see none but God,' Julien added with a hypocritical air, calculated, to his mind, to ward off further blows.
</div>
<div class="right">
“从来没有：您知道我在教堂里只看上帝，”于连说，多少有一点假正经的样子，反正怎么样都行，只要脑袋上不再挨巴掌。
</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'There is something behind this, all the same,' replied the suspicious peasant, and was silent for a moment; 'but I shall get nothing out of you,you damned hypocrite. The fact is, I'm going to be rid of you, and my
saw will run all the better without you. You have made a friend of the parson or someone, and he's got you a fine post. Go and pack your traps,and I'll take you to M. de Renal's where you're to be tutor to the children.'

</div>
<div class="right">

“这里面总是有点名堂，”狡猾的乡巴佬说，接着顿了顿，又说道，“我是不能从你这儿套出什么啦，该死的伪君子。总之，我要甩掉你了，而我的锯木厂只会办得更好。你讨得了本堂神甫先生或其他什么人的欢心，他们给你找了个好位置。收拾你的东西吧，我送你去德·莱纳先生家，你要当孩子们的家庭教师啦。”

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'What am I to get for that?'</p>
<p>'Board, clothing and three hundred francs in wages.'</p>
<p>'I do not wish to be a servant,'</p>
<p>'Animal, who ever spoke of your being a servant? Would I allow my son to be a servant?'</p>
<p>'But, with whom shall I have my meals?'</p>
</div>
  <div class="right"><p>“那给我什么？”</p>
<p>“吃，穿，还有三百法郎的工钱。”</p>
<p>“我不愿意当仆人。”</p>
<p>“畜生，谁说让你当仆人啦？难道我愿意我的儿子当仆人吗？”</p>
<p>“可是，我跟谁一起吃饭呢？”</p></div></div>
 
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This question left old Sorel at a loss; he felt  that if he spoke he might be guilty of some imprudence; he flew into a rage  with Julien, upon whom he showered abuse, accusing him of greed, and left him  to go and consult his other sons.
</div>
<div class="right">

这个问题把老索莱尔问住了，他觉得不能再谈下去，言多语失啊；于是他暴跳如雷，大骂于连，说他就知道吃，撇下他找另外两个儿子商量去了。



</div>
</div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Presently Julien saw them, each leaning upon his axe and  deliberating together. After watching them for some time, Julien, seeing that  he could make out nothing of their discussion, went and took his place on the  far side of the saw, so as not to be taken by surprise. He wanted time to  consider this sudden announcement which was altering his destiny, but felt himself  to be incapable of prudence; his imagination was wholly taken up with forming  pictures of what he would see in M. de Renal's fine house.
</div>
<div class="right">

过了一会儿，于连看见他们各自拄着一把斧子，正在商量。于连看了很久，觉得也猜不出什么，又怕被人撞见，就往锯子的另一侧去。他想好好考虑一下这个改变他命运的意外消息，但是他觉得静不下心来，他的想象力全部用来描画他将在德·莱纳先生的漂亮房子里看到的东西了。

</div>
</div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I must give up all  that,' he said to himself, 'rather than let myself be brought down to feeding  with the servants. My father will try to force me; I would sooner die. I have  saved fifteen francs and eight sous, I shall run away tonight; in two days, by  keeping to sideroads where I need not fear the police, I can be at Besancon;  there I enlist as a soldier, and, if necessary, cross the border into  Switzerland. But then, goodbye to everything, goodbye to that fine clerical  profession which is a stepping stone to everything.'
</div>
<div class="right">

他心想：“宁可放弃这—切，也不能沦落到和仆人一起吃饭的地步。我父亲想强迫我，那我就去死。我有十五个法郎八个苏的积蓄，今夜就逃走；走小路碰不上宪兵，两天就到了贝藏松；我在那儿当兵，需要的话，就去瑞士。不过，这么一来，前程完了，雄心壮志完了，无所不能的教士这一类好职业也完了。”


</div>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This horror of feeding with the servants was not natural to Julien;  he would, in seeking his fortune, have done other things far more disagreeable.  He derived this repugnance from Rousseau's Confessions. It was the one book  that helped his imagination to form any idea of the world. The collection of  reports of the Grand Army and the Memorial de Sainte-<a href="#" title=" [həˈli:n]
    n.【女名】女子名">Helene</a> completed his  Koran. He would have gone to the stake for those three books. Never did he  believe in any other. Remembering a saying of the old Surgeon-Major, he regarded  all the other books in the world as liars,written by rogues in order to obtain  advancement.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连厌恶跟仆人一起吃饭，并非天生如此，为了飞黄腾达，他可以做令人痛苦得多的事情，他的这种厌恶得之于卢梭的《忏悔录》。他全靠这本书来想象世界是一副什么样子。大军公报汇编和《圣赫勒布岛回忆录》则补足了他的《可兰经》。为了这三本书，他可以豁出命去。他绝不相信任何别的一本书，他相信老外科军医的话，认为世上其它的书都是谎言，是—些骗子为了升官发财而写出来的。</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>With his fiery nature Julien had one of those astonishing memories  so often found in foolish people. To win over the old priest Chelan, upon whom  he saw quite clearly that his own future depended, he had learned by heart the  entire New Testament in Latin; he knew also M. de Maistre's book Du Pape, and  had as little belief in one as in the other.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>于连有一颗火热的心，还有一种常常与愚蠢相结合的惊人的记忆力，他看出他的前途取决于年老的本堂神父谢朗，为了讨得他的欢心，竟把一部拉丁文的《新约全书》背下；他也熟悉德·迈斯特先生的《论教皇》，虽然这两本书他都不相信。</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As though by a mutual agreement, Sorel and his son avoided speaking to  one another for the rest of the day. At dusk, Julien went to the cure for his  divinity lesson, but did not think it prudent to say anything to him of the  strange proposal that had been made to his father. 'It may be a trap,'he told  himself; 'I must pretend to have forgotten about it.'</P>


</div>
<div class="right">



<p>好像双方有了默契，索莱尔和他的儿子这一天都避免和对方说话。傍晚，他到本堂神父那儿去上神学课，他认为把别人向他父亲提出的奇怪的建议告诉神甫是不谨慎的。“也许这是个圈套，”他想，“应该装作已经忘了的样子。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Early on the following day, M. de Renal sent for old Sorel, who,  after keeping him waiting for an hour or two, finally appeared, beginning as he  entered the door a hundred excuses interspersed with as many reverences. By  dint of giving voice to every sort of objection, Sorel succeeded in gathering  that his son was to take his meals with the master and mistress of the house,  and on days when they had company in a room by himself with the children.  Finding an increasing desire to raise difficulties the more he discerned a  genuine anxiety on the Mayor's part, and being moreover filled with distrust  and bewilderment, Sorel asked to see the room in which his son was to sleep. It  was a large chamber very decently furnished, but the servants were already  engaged in carrying into it the beds of the three children.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>第二天一大早，德、莱纳先生便差人来叫老索莱尔，而这个老索莱尔让他等了一、二个钟头，一进门便百般道歉，又百般表示敬意。他提出了各种各样的异议，终于弄明白他的儿子将和男主人女主人同桌吃饭，如有客人则独自在另一个房间和孩子们一起吃，便提出越来越多的附加条件，再说他心里还充满了怀嶷和惊奇，就要求看看他儿子睡觉的房间。那是一个布置得十分整洁的大房间，已经有人忙着把孩子们的床往里面搬了。</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At this the old peasant began to see daylight; he at once asked with  as surance to see the coat which would be given to his son. M. de Renal opened  his desk and took out a hundred francs.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>此情此景使这位老人大受启发，他立刻坚定要求看看他儿子要穿的衣服。德、莱纳先生拉开抽屉，拿出一百法郎。</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
'With this money, your son can go to M.  Durand, the clothier, and get himself a suit of black.'</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“您和儿子拿这笔钱到呢绒商杜郎先生的店里，可以做一套黑衣服。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And supposing I take him away from you,' said the peasant, who had completely  forgotten the reverential forms of address. 'Will he take this black coat with  him?'</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“那么，即使我把他从这里领回去，”乡巴佬说，他一下子把他的繁文褥节得干干净净，“这衣服还是他的吗？”</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Certainly.'</P>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“那当然。”</p>


</div>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Oh, very well!' said Sorel in a drawling tone, 'then there's only  one thing for us still to settle: the money you're to give him.'</P>


</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“那好吧，”索莱尔拿着一种慢悠悠的腔调说，“我们就乘一件事要达成一致意见：您给他多少钱。”</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!' M. de Renal indignantly exclaimed, 'we agreed upon that  yesterday: I give three hundred francs; I consider that plenty, if not too much.'</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“什么！”德、莱纳先生生气地叫了起来，“我们昨天已经一致同意：我出三百法郎；我认为这已经够了，也许太多了。”</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That was your offer, I do not deny it,' said old Sorel, speaking  even more slowly; then, by a stroke of genius which will astonish only those who  do not know the Franc-Comtois peasant, he added, looking M. de Renal steadily  in the face: 'We can do better elsewhere.'</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“这是您出的数，我不否认，”老索莱尔说得更慢了；他紧紧地盯着德、莱纳先生，使出只有不了解弗郎什－孔泰的农民的人才会感到惊奇的那种天才，补了一句：“我们找得到更好的地方。”</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At these words the Mayor was thrown into confusion. He recovered himself,  however, and, after an adroit conversation lasting fully two hours, in which  not a word was said without a purpose, the peasant's shrewdness prevailed over  that of the rich man, who was not dependent on his for his living. All the  innumerable conditions which were to determine Julien's new existence were  finally settled; not only was his salary fixed at four hundred francs, but it  was to be paid in advance, on the first day of each month.</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>听了这句话，市长大惊失色。不过，他还是恢复了镇静，他们足足周旋了两个钟头，字斟句酌，没有一句信口胡说，农民的精明终于战胜了富人的精明，富人毕竟不以此为生啊。一大堆安排于连的新生活的条款一一商定；他的薪水不仅定为四百法郎，而每月一号预先付清。</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very well! I shall let him have thirty-five francs,' said M. de  Renal.</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“好吧，我每月给他三十五法郎，”德、莱纳先生说。</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To make a round  sum, a rich and generous gentleman like our Mayor,'the peasant insinuated in a  coaxing voice, 'will surely go as far as thirty six.'</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“凑个双数吧，”乡巴佬用谄媚的声调说，“像我们的市长先生这样有钱又慷慨的人，一定会改成三十六法郎的。”</p>



</div>
</div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>'All right,' said M. de Renal, 'but let us have no more of this.'</P>

</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“行，”德·莱纳先生说，“不过别再罗嗦了。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">



<p>For  once, anger gave him a tone of resolution. The peasant saw that he could  advance no farther. Thereupon M. de Renal began in turn to make headway. He  utterly refused to hand over the thirty-six francs for the first month to old  Sorel, who was most eager to receive the money on his son's behalf. It occurred  to M. de Renal that he would be obliged to describe to his wife the part he had  played throughout this transaction.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>这一回，愤怒使他的口气变得强硬，乡巴佬也看出他得见好就收。这下轮到德·莱纳先生占上风了。他始终不肯把第一个月的三十六法郎交给急于为儿子领钱的老索莱尔。德·莱纳先生突然想到，他必须把在整个谈判中起的作用讲给妻子听。</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">



<p>'Let me have back the hundred francs I gave you,' he said angrily.  'M.Durand owes me money. I shall go with your son to choose the black cloth.'</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“把我刚才给您那一百法郎还给我，”他生气地说：“杜朗先生还欠着我呢。我跟您的儿子一块去扯黑呢料子。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">



<p>After this bold stroke, Sorel prudently retired upon his expressions  of respect; they occupied a good quarter of an hour. In the end, seeing that there  was certainly nothing more to be gained, he withdrew. His final reverence ended  with the words:</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>索莱尔见到这一强硬之举，便老老实实又拣起那些毕恭毕敬的套话，足足说了一刻钟。最后，他看出确实再捞不到什么了，便告辞。他最后鞠了一躬，以下面这句话结束：</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">



<p>'I shall send my son up to the chateau.'</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“我回头就把我的儿子送到公馆来。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">



<p>It was thus that the Mayor's subordinates spoke of his house when they  wished to please him.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>每当市长先生的子民们想讨好他的时候，就这样称呼他的房子。</p>


</div>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Returning to his mill, Sorel looked in vain for his son. Doubtful as  to what might be in store for him, Julien had left home in the dead of night.He  had been anxious to find a safe hiding-place for his books and his Cross of the  Legion of Honour. He had removed the whole of his treasures to the house of a  young timber-merchant, a friend of his, by the name of Fouque, who lived on the  side of the high mountain overlooking Verrieres.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">



<p>索莱尔回到锯木厂到处找不到儿子，原来于连对可能发生的事情心怀疑虑，半夜里就出门了。他想为他的书和荣誉团勋章找个安全的地方。他把这些东西都送到一个年轻的木材商那里，此人是他的朋友，名叫富凯，住在俯瞰维里埃的大山里。</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When he reappeared: 'Heaven knows, you damned idler,' his father said  to him, 'whether you will ever have enough honour to pay me for the cost of  your keep, which I have been advancing to you all these years! Pack up your  rubbish, and off with you to the Mayor's.'</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>当他回来的时候，他的父亲劈头便说：“该死的懒鬼，天知道你是不是争这口气，会把这么多年的饭钱还给我。拿着你的破烂，滚到市长先生那里去吧。”</p>



</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien, astonished not to receive a thrashing, made haste to set  off. But no sooner was he out of sight of his terrible father than he slackened  his pace. He decided that it would serve the ends of his hypocrisy to pay a visit  to the church.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>于连感到惊奇，居然没有挨打，赶紧走了。然而，一当他那可怕的父亲看不见他，他就放慢了脚步。他认为到教堂转一圈儿对他的虚伪有好处。</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The idea surprises you? Before arriving at this horrible idea, the  soul of the young peasant had had a long way to go.</P>


</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“虚伪”这个词使您感到惊讶吗？在到达这个可怕的词之前，这年轻农民的心灵曾走过很长一段路呢。</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When he was still a child, the sight of certain dragoons of  the 6th, in their long, white cloaks, and helmets  adorned with long crests of  black horse-hair, who were returning from Italy, and whom Julien saw tying their  horses to the barred window of his father's house, drove him mad with longing  for a military career.Later on he listened with ecstasy to the accounts of the battles of  the Bridge of Lodi, Arcole and Rivoli given him by the old Surgeon-Major.He noticed the burning gaze which the old man directed at his  Cross.</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>还在很小的时候，于连看见第六团的几个龙骑兵，身披白色大氅，头戴饰有黑色鬃毛的盔，从意大利回来。他看见他们把马拴在父亲的房子的窗栅上，这使他发疯般地爱上了军人的职业。后来，他又激动地聆听老外科军医讲述洛迪桥战役、阿尔科战役和里沃利战役。他注意到老人投向他的十字勋章的火一样燃烧的目光。</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But when Julien was fourteen, they began to build a church at Verrieres,  one that might be called magnificent for so small a town. There were, in particular,  four marble pillars the sight of which impressed Julien; they became famous  throughout the countryside, owing to the deadly enmity which they aroused  between the Justice of the Peace and the young vicar, sent down from Besancon,  who was understood to be the spy of the Congregation. The Justice of the Peace  came within an ace of losing his post, such at least was the common report. Had  he not dared to have a difference of opinion with a priest who, almost every fortnight,  went to Besancon, where he saw, people said, the Right Reverend Lord Bishop?</P>


</div>
<div class="right">




<p>然而当于连十四岁时，维里埃开始建一座教堂，对于一个如此小的城市来说，这教堂可称壮丽。尤其是那四根大理石柱，于连印象极深；这四根柱子曾在治安法官和年轻的副本堂神甫之间挑起不共戴天的仇恨，因此在当地出了名，年轻的副本神甫是从贝藏松来的，据说是圣会的密探，治安法官险些丢了位置，至少舆论是这么说的。他怎么敢与一位教士不和？此人每半个月去一次贝藏松，据说是去晋见主教大人。</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In the midst of all this, the Justice of the Peace, the father of a  large family, passed a number of sentences which appeared unjust; all of these were  directed against such of the inhabitants as read the Constitutionnel.The right  party was triumphant. The  sums involved amounted, it was true, to no more than four or five francs; but  one of these small fines was levied upon a nailsmith, Julien's godfather. In  his anger, this man exclaimed: 'What a change! And to think that, for twenty  years and more,the Justice was reckoned such an honest man!' The Surgeon-Major,Julien's  friend, was dead.</p>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>就在这时，膝下儿女成行的治安法官似乎有几件案子判得不公，而都是针对居民中看《立宪新闻》的人。正确的一方终于胜诉。其实不过是三、五法郎的事，但是这些轻微的罚款中的一笔要由一个制钉工人出。这制钉工人是于连的教父。这人大怒，喊道：“世道真是变了！还说二十多年来治安法官一直被看作正派人呢！”外科军医，于连的朋友，此时已经去世。</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>All at once Julien ceased to speak of Napoleon; he announced  his intention of becoming a priest, and was constantly to be seen, in his father's  sawmill, engaged in learning by heart a Latin Bible which the cure had lent  him. The good old man, amazed at his progress, devoted whole evenings to  instructing him in divinity. Julien gave utterance in his company to none but  pious sentiments. Who could have supposed that that girlish face, so pale and  gentle, hid the unshakeable determination to expose himself to the risk of a  thousand deaths rather than fail to make his fortune?</P>

	
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>于连突然不再谈论拿破仑，宣布他要当教士，人们看见他在父亲的锯木厂里孜孜不倦地背诵那本神甫借给他的拉丁文圣经。这位善良的老人对于连的进步大为赞叹，常常用整个晚上教他神学，于连只在他面前表露虔诚的感情。谁能猜得到，他脸色如此苍白，如此温柔，一副女孩子的容貌，心里竟藏着宁可死上一千次也要飞黄腾达的不可动摇的决心呢！</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>To Julien, making a fortune meant in the first place leaving  Verrieres;he loathed his native place. Everything that he saw there froze his imagination.</P>


	
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>对于连来说，飞黄腾达首先就是离开维里埃，他恨透了他的家乡。他在那里看到的一切使他的想象力都冻住了。</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>From his earliest boyhood, he had had moments of exaltation. At such  times he dreamed with rapture that one day he would be introduced to the  beautiful ladies of Paris; he would manage to attract their attention by some  brilliant action. Why should he not be loved by one of them, as Bonaparte, when  still penniless, had been loved by the brilliant Madame de Beauharnais? For  many years now, perhaps not an hour of Julien's life had passed without his  reminding himself that Bonaparte, an obscure <a href="#" title="美 [sə'bɔltərn]

    adj.次；〈英〉【军】陆军中的；【逻】特称的

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>他自幼年起，就常有兴奋的时刻。他曾美滋滋地梦想过，有朝一日被介绍给巴黎的美妇人，他会用辉煌的壮举邀得她们的垂青。为什么他就不能被其中的一个爱上呢？波拿巴不是还在穷困的时候就被光彩照人的德·博阿尔内夫人爱上了吗？多年以来，于连大概无时不对自己说，波拿巴，一个默默无闻又没有财产的中尉，靠他的剑做了世界的主人。这个想法给自认为极不幸的他带来安慰，又使他在快乐的时候感到加倍的快乐。</p>




</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

	
<p>The building of the church and the sentences passed  by the Justice brought him sudden enlightenment; an idea which occurred to him drove  him almost out of his senses for some weeks, and finally took possession of him  with the absolute power of the first idea which a passion ate nature believes  itself to have discovered.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">




<p>教堂的兴建和治安法官的宣判使他一下子恍然大悟；他有了—个念头，好几个星期里他就像疯了一样，最后，这个念头至高无上的威力完全控制了他。—个充满激情的人自认为他所创造的第—个念头，往往具有这种至高无上的威力。</p>

<p>'When Bonaparte made a name for himself, France was in fear of being  invaded; military distinction was necessary and fashionable. Today we see  priests at forty drawing stipends of a hundred thousand francs, that is to say  three times as much as the famous divisional commanders under Napoleon. They  must have people to support them. Look at the Justice here, so wise a man,  always so honest until now, sacrificing his honour, at his age, from fear of  offending a young vicar of thirty. I must become a priest.'</P>

<p>“波拿巴名扬天下之日，正是法国害怕受到侵犯之时；战功不仅必要，而且时髦。可如今一些四十岁的教士就有十万法郎的年俸，相当象破仑的那些著名将领收入的三倍。—定有人支持他们。看这位治安法官，如此聪明，一直是如此正派，又如此年长，只因害怕得罪一个三十岁的年轻副本堂神甫，就坏了自己的名声。应该当教士。”</p>

<p>On one occasion, in the midst of his new-found piety, after Julien  had been studying divinity for two years, he was betrayed by a sudden blaze of  the fire that devoured his spirit. This was at M. Chelan's; at a dinner party  of priests, to whom the good cure had introduced him as an educational prodigy,  he found himself uttering frenzied praise of Napoleon.</P>



</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一次，他学习神学已经两年，新的虔诚正当盛时，那股噬咬着他的灵魂的火突然迸发出来，揭去了他的假面。那是在谢朗先生家里有许多教士参加的—次晚餐上，善良的本堂神甫把他当作神童介绍给大家，他却突然狂热地颂扬起拿破仑来了。</p>

<p>He bound his right arm across his chest, pretending that he had put  the arm out of joint when shifting a fir trunk, and kept it for two months in this  awkward position. After this drastic penance, he forgave himself.</P>



</div>
<div class="right">
<p>事后他自己把右臂吊在胸前，说是翻转枞树干时脱了臼，这种不舒服的姿式他保持了两个月，这次体罚之后，他才饶恕自己。

<p>Such is the young man of eighteen, but weak in appearance, whom you would  have said to be, at the most, seventeen, who, carrying a small parcel under his  arm, was entering the magnificent church of Verrieres.</P>


</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看，这个十九岁的年轻人，外表柔弱，看上去至多十七岁，正夹着一个小包，走进维里埃的壮丽的教堂。</p>

<p>He found it dark and deserted. In view of some festival, all the  windows in the building had been covered with crimson cloth; the effect of this,  when the sun shone, was a dazzling blaze of light, of the most imposing and  most religious character. Julien shuddered. Being alone in the church, he took  his seat on the bench that had the most handsome appearance. It bore the arms  of M. de Renal.</P>

</div>
<div class="right">



<p>他觉得这教堂阴暗、僻静，每逢节日，教堂的窗户都挂上深红色的帷幔，阳光射入，产生出—种最富庄严和宗教性的眩目的光线效果。于连战栗了。教堂里只有他一个人，他在一把外观最漂亮的椅子上坐下，这把椅子饰有德·莱纳先生家的纹章。</p>

<p>On his way out, Julien thought he saw blood by the holy water stoup;it was  some of the water that had been spilt: the light from the red curtains which  draped the windows made it appear like blood.</p>

<p>于连走出教堂，以为看见圣水缸旁有血，那是洒出来的圣水，窗子上的红帐的反光照在上面，看起来像是血。</p>

This phrase, so often repeated in the old surgeon's accounts of battles, had a heroic sound in Julien's ears. He rose and walked rapidly to M. de Renal's house.

<p>Despite these brave resolutions, as soon as he caught sight of the house  twenty yards away he was overcome by an unconquerable shyness. The iron gate  stood open; it seemed to him magnificent. He would have now to go in through  it.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>尽管他下定了决心，但当他看见那幢房子就在二十步外的时候，还是被一种不可克服的胆怯攫住。铁栅栏门开着，他觉得很豪华，他必须进去。</p>

<p>Julien was not the only person whose heart was troubled by his  arrival in this household. Madame de Renal's extreme timidity was disconcerted by  the idea of this stranger who, in the performance of his duty, would be  constantly coming between her and her children. She was accustomed to having  her sons sleep in her own room. That morning, many tears had flowed when she  saw their little beds being carried into the apartment intended for the tutor.  In vain did she beg her husband to let the bed of Stanislas Xavier, the  youngest boy, be taken back to her room.</p>

<p>来到这幢房子里而感到心慌意乱的，不止于连一个人。德·莱纳夫人胆子极小，一想到这个外人便仓皇失措，而根据职责这个人是要经常处在她和孩子们之间的。她习惯于让儿子们睡在她的房间里。早晨，她看见他们的小床被搬进指定给家庭教师的房间里，眼泪不住地流。她央求丈夫把小儿子斯坦尼斯拉—克萨维埃的床再搬回她的房间，但是没有用。</p>

Womanly delicacy was carried to excess in Madame  de Renal. She formed a mental picture of a coarse, unkempt creature, employed  to scold her children, simply because he knew Latin, a barbarous tongue for the  sake of which her sons would be whipped.</p>

  <div class="right">





<p>在德·莱纳夫人身上，女性的敏感到了过份的程度。她想象出一个最令人厌恶的家伙，粗鲁，蓬头垢面，只是因为会拉丁文就被雇来训斥她的孩子，为了这种野蛮的语言，她的儿子们还可能挨鞭子呢。</p>
