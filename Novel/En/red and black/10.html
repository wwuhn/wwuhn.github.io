<div class="left quo1 ">
<p>But passion most dissembles, yet betrays, Even by its darkness; as
the blackest sky Foretells the heaviest tempest.</p>
<p>Don Juan, I. 73</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>但是热情最会假装，而越是隐藏，则越是显露；正如最阴暗的天空，预兆最大的暴风雨。</p>
<p>《唐璜》 1.73</p></div>
</div>

  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>M. de Renal, who was visiting every room in the house, reappeared in  the children's room with the servants who brought back the palliasses refilled.  The sudden entry of this man was the last straw to Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳先生走遍了古堡的所有卧房，跟着搬回床垫的仆人又回到孩子们的卧房。这个人突然进来，对于连来说，犹如盛满水的罐子又加了一滴，立刻溢了出来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
  
  <p>Paler, more sombre  than usual, he advanced towards him. M. de Renal stood still and looked at his  servants.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连朝着他冲过去，脸色比平时更苍白，更阴沉。德·莱纳先生站住了，看了看他的仆人们。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,' Julien  began, 'do you suppose that with any other tutor your children would have made  the same progress that they have made with me?If your answer is no,' he went on  without giving M. de Renal time to speak, 'how dare you presume to reproach me  with neglecting them?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“先生，”于连对他说，“您认为您的孩子跟别的任何一位家庭教师会跟我取得同样的进步吗？如果您说不，”于连继续说，不容德·莱纳开口，“那您怎么敢指责我丢下他们不管呢？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M. de Renal, who had barely recovered from his alarm,  concluded from the strange tone which he saw this young peasant adopt that he had  in his pocket some more attractive offer and was going to leave him.Julien's  anger increasing as he spoke:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·莱纳先生吓了一跳，惊魂甫定，立刻从这个小乡下人的奇怪的口吻中得出结论，他的口袋里肯定装着什么条件更好的建议，他要弃他而去了。于连越说火越大：</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I can live without you, Sir,' he concluded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我离了您也能活，先生，”他补了一句。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I am extremely sorry to see you so agitated,' replied M. de  Renal,stammering a little. The servants were a few feet away, and were occupied  in making the beds.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“看到您这样冲动，我确实感到遗憾，”德·莱纳先生有点儿结结巴巴地回答说。仆人们在十步以外，正忙着铺床。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That is not enough for me, Sir,' Julien went on, beside himself  with rage; 'think of the abominable things you said to me, and in the presence of  ladies, too!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我要的不是这个，先生，”于连怒不可遏，“想想您对我说的那些破坏我的名誉的话吧，而且还是当着女人的面！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M. de Renal was only too well aware of what Julien was asking, and conflicting  passions did battle in his heart. It so happened that Julien,now really mad  with rage, exclaimed: '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生太知道于连要什么了，一场痛苦的斗争撕扯着他的心。于连真地是疯了，吼道：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>I know where to go, Sir, when I leave your house.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“出了您的门，先生，我知道上哪儿去。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On hearing these words, M. de Renal had a vision of Julien  established in M. Valenod's household.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>听了这句话，德·莱纳先生立刻看见于连在瓦勒诺先生家里安顿下来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very well, Sir,' he said at length with a sigh, and the air of a  man calling in a surgeon to perform the most painful operation, 'I agree to  your request. From the day after tomorrow, which is the first of the month, I shall  give you fifty francs monthly.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好吧！先生，”他终于说，叹了口气，那神情就像请求外科医生给他做一个最令人痛苦的手术，“我同意您的要求。后天是一号，我从后天起每月给您五十法郎。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien wanted to laugh and remained speechless:  his anger had completely vanished.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连真想笑，却惊得一下呆住，他的怒火已经无影无踪了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I did not despise the animal enough,' he said to himself. 'This, no  doubt, is the most ample apology so base a nature is capable of making.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这畜生我还蔑视得不够，”他心想，“这大概是一个如此卑劣的人所能表示的最大的歉意了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  children, who had listened to this scene open-mouthed, ran  to the garden to tell their mother that M. Julien was in a great rage, but that  he was to have fifty francs a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>孩子们听见了这场争吵，惊得嘴都合不上。他们跑到花园里，告诉他们的妈妈于连先生火发得好大，不过他每个月就要有五十法郎了。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien went after them from force of habit, without so much as at M.  de Renal, whom he left in a state of intense annoyance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连习惯地跟着他们出去了，看都没有看德·莱纳先生一眼，留下他一个人在那儿气得鼓鼓地。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That's a hundred and sixty-eight francs,' the Mayor said to  himself,'that M. Valenod has cost me. I must really say a few firm words to him  about his contract to supply the foundlings.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>市长心里想：“瓦勒诺先生又让我破费了一百六十八法郎。他要管弃儿的供应，我一定得给他来两句硬的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A moment later, Julien again stood before him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>过了一会儿，于连又来到德·莱纳先生面前。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I have a matter of conscience to discuss with M. Chelan. I have the  honour to inform you that I shall be absent for some hours.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我有些良心上的事情要对谢朗先生说，我有幸通知您，我要离开几个小时。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah, my dear Julien,' said M. de Renal, laughing in the most  insincere manner, 'the whole day, if you wish, the whole of tomorrow, my worthy  friend. Take the gardener's horse to go to Verrieres.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，我亲爱的于连，”德·莱纳先生说，一边最虚假地笑笑，“您愿意的话，一整天都行，明天一整天吧，我的好朋友。骑上园丁的马到维里埃去吧。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There,' M. de Renal said to himself, 'he's going with an answer to Valenod;  he's given me no promise, but we must let the young hot head cool down.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生心里说：“他这是去给瓦勒诺先生回话了，他对我还没有任何许诺，不过应该让这个年轻人的头脑冷下来。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien made a speedy escape and climbed up among the big woods through  which one can go from Vergy to Verrieres. He was in no hurry to reach M.  Chelan's. So far from desiring to involve himself in a fresh display of  hypocrisy, he needed time to see clearly into his own heart,and to give  audience to the swarm of conflicting feelings that disturbed it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连迅速离开，走进山上的大树林，从那里可以直奔维里埃。他不想这么快就到谢朗先生那里去。他一点儿也不想强制自己再去演一场虚伪的戏，他需要把自己的心灵看个清楚，审视使他激动不已的那些蜂拥而至的感情。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I have won a battle,' he said to himself as soon as he found  himself in the shelter of the woods and out of sight of anyone, 'I have really  won a battle!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我打了一个胜仗，”他一进入树林，远离了众人的目光，就立刻对自己说，“我这是打了一个胜仗呀！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The last word painted his whole position for him in glowing  colours,and restored some degree of tranquillity to his heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话给他的整个处境涂上了一重美丽的色彩，使他的心平静了一些。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Here I am with a salary of fifty francs a month; M. de Renal must  be in a fine fright. But of what?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我现在一个月有五十法郎啦，德·莱纳先生刚才肯定是怕得要命。可他怕什么呢？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His meditation as to what could have frightened the prosperous and powerful  man against whom, an hour earlier, he had been seething with rage completely  restored Julien's serenity. He was almost conscious, for a moment, of the  exquisite beauty of the woods through which he was walking. Enormous fragments  of bare rock had in times past fallen into the heart of the forest from the  side of the mountain. Tall beeches rose almost as high as these rocks whose  shadow provided a delicious coolness within a few yards of places where the  heat of the sun's rays would have made it impossible to stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这个又幸运又有权势的家伙，于连一个小时之前还对他大发雷霆，能有什么事情让他害怕呢？于连想着想着，心里终于完全平静下来。他在树林中走着，一时居然对其迷人的美有了些感觉。大块大块光秃秃的岩石很久以前从山峰那边滚下来，落在树林中央，一些粗壮的山毛榉长得几乎和这些岩石一样高。岩石的阴影中凉爽宜人。三步之外，阳光炽热，晒得人不能驻足。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien paused for a breathing space in the shadow of these great  rocks,then went on climbing. Presently, by following a narrow path, barely  visible and used only by goat herds, he found himself standing upon an immense  rock, where he could be certain of his complete isolation from his fellowmen.  This natural position made him smile, it suggested to him the position to which  he was burning to attain in the moral sphere. The pure air of these lofty  mountains breathed serenity and even joy into his soul. The Mayor of Verrieres  might still, in his eyes, be typical of all the rich and insolent denizens of  the earth, but Julien felt that the hatred which had convulsed him that  afternoon contained, notwithstanding its violence, no element of personal ill-feeling.  Should he cease to see M. de Renal, within a week he would have forgotten him,  the man himself, his house, his dogs, his children and all that was his. 'I  have forced him, I do not know how, to make the greatest of sacrifices. What,  more than fifty crowns a year? A moment earlier I had just escaped from the  greatest danger. That makes two victories in one day; the second contains no merit,  I must try to discover the reason. But we can leave such arduous research for  tomorrow.'</p>
<p></div>
<div class="right"><p>于连在这些巨石的阴影中喘了口气，然后又开始攀登。他沿一条很不明显的、只供放山羊的人走的狭窄小路走着，很快发现自己站在一块巨大的悬岩上，并且确信已经远离了所有的人。这种肉体的位置使他露出了微笑，为他描绘出他渴望达到的精神的位置。高山上纯净的空气给他的心灵送来了平静，甚至快乐。在他眼里，维里埃的市长当然一直是世上所有有钱的人和蛮横的人的代表，但是他感到，刚才还使他激动的那种仇恨虽然在情绪上表现得十分强烈，却没有丝毫个人的性质。倘使他不再看见德·莱纳先生了，只须一个礼拜，他就会忘掉他，忘掉他本人、他的古堡、他的狗、他的孩子和他的全家。“我不知道怎么就迫使他做出了最大的牺牲。怎么！每年五十多个埃居！而且我刚刚摆脱了最大的危险。一天里竟获得了两个胜利；第二个胜利不足道，但是应该猜出个究竟。不过，还是明天见吧，这种伤脑筋的追究。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien, erect upon his mighty rock, gazed at the sky, kindled to  flame by an August sun. The grass-hoppers were chirping in the patch of meadow  beneath the rock; when they ceased everything around him was silence. Twenty  leagues of country lay at his feet. From time to time a hawk, risen from the  bare cliffs above his head, caught his eye as it wheeled silently in its vast  circles. Julien's eye followed mechanically the bird of prey. Its calm,  powerful motion impressed him, he envied such strength, he envied such  isolation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连站在那块巨大的悬岩上，凝视着被八月的太阳烤得冒火的天空。蝉在悬岩下面的田野上鸣叫，当叫声停止的时候，周围一片寂静。方圆二十法里的地方展现在他的脚下，宛然在目。于连看见一只鹰从头顶上那些大块的山岩中飞出，静静地盘旋，不时画出一个个巨大的圆圆。于连的眼睛不由自主地跟随着这只猛禽。这只猛禽的动作安详宁静，浑厚有力，深深地打动了他，他羡慕这种力量，他羡慕这种孤独。</p>
