<p>His  heart does not at first realise the whole extent of his misery: he is more  disturbed than moved. But in proportion as his reason returns, he feels the  depth of his misfortune. All the pleasures in life are as nothing to him, he  can feel only the sharp points of the despair that is rending him. But what is  the good of speaking of physical pain? What pain felt by the body alone is  comparable to this?</p>
<p>JEANPAUL</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>他的心最初并不明白不幸有多么强烈；他的慌乱超过他的激动。但是随着理智的恢复，他感到了不幸的深度。所有生活中的欢乐，对他来说，都消失了，他只能感觉到绝望用利爪在撕裂他的胸膛。但是谈肉体的痛苦有什么用呢？有哪种仅仅身体上感觉到的痛苦能和这种痛苦相比？</p>

  <div class="left"><p>The  dinner bell rang, Julien had barely time to dress; he found Mathilde in the  drawing-room urging her brother and M. de Croisenois not to go and spend the  evening with Madame la Marechale de Fervaques.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>晚饭的铃声响了，于连匆匆穿好衣服；他在客厅里看见了玛蒂尔德，她正极力劝说她哥哥和德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生不要去絮伦参加德·费瓦克元帅夫人的晚会。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  could hardly have been more seductive and charming with them.After  dinner they were joined by M. de Luz, M. de Caylus and several of their  friends. One would have said that Mademoiselle de La Mole had resumed, together  with the observance of sisterly affection, that of the strictest conventions.  Although the weather that evening was charming, she insisted that they should  not go out to the garden; she was determined not to be lured away from the  armchair in which Madame de La Mole was enthroned. The blue sofa was the centre  of the group, as in winter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在他们面前，她真真是极尽迷人、妩媚之能事。晚饭后，德·吕兹先生、德·凯吕斯先生和他们的好几位朋友都来了。简直可以说，德·拉莫尔小姐重新崇拜起手足之情和最严格的礼法了。尽管当晚天气极好，她坚持不去花园，她希望大家不要远离德·拉莫尔夫人坐的那张安乐椅。像冬天一样，那张蓝色的长沙发又成了这群人的中心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  was out of humour with the garden, or at least it seemed to her to be utterly  boring: it was associated with the memory of Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她讨厌花园，至少她觉得这花园十分乏味，因为它让她想到于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Misery  destroys judgment. Our hero made the blunder of clinging to that little cane  chair which in the past had witnessed such brilliant triumphs. This evening,  nobody spoke to him; his presence passed as though unperceived or worse. Those  of Mademoiselle de La Mole's friends who were seated near him at the end of the  sofa made an affectation of turning their backs on him, or so he thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不幸降低智力。我们的主人公太笨，居然又站在那把小草垫椅子旁边了，虽然它曾经是那么辉煌的胜利的见证。如今没有人跟他说话，他的在场无人理会，甚至更糟。德·拉莫尔小姐的朋友中间，坐在长沙发上他这一头的几位都故意背对着他，至少他是这么想的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is a courtier's disgrace,' he concluded. He decided to study for a moment the  people who were trying to crush him with their disdain.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是一种宫廷上的失宠啊，”他想。他决定研究一下那些企图用轻蔑制服他的人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Luz's uncle held an important post in the King's Household, the consequence  of which was that this gallant officer opened his conversation with each fresh  arrival with the following interesting detail: His uncle had set off at seven  o'clock for Saint Cloud, and expected to spend the night there. This piece of  news was introduced in the most casual manner, but it never failed to come out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·吕兹先生的叔父在国王身边担任要职，因此，这位漂亮军官每逢与人交谈，开头总要加上这么一种特殊的佐料：他的叔父七点钟动身去了丝克卢，晚上打算睡在那儿。这个情况好像随口说出来的，并无深意，然而时候一到它是必来无疑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Upon  observing M. de Croisenois with the severe eye of misery, Julien remarked the  enormous influence which this worthy and amiable young man attributed to occult  causes. So much so that he became moody and cross if he heard an event of any  importance set down to a simple and quite natural cause. 'There is a trace of  madness there,' Julien told himself. 'This character bears a striking  resemblance to that of the Emperor Alexander, as Prince Korasoff described him  to me.' During the first year of his stay in Paris, poor Julien, coming fresh  from the Seminary, dazzled by the graces, so novel to him, of all these  agreeable young men, could do nothing but admire them. Their true character was  only now beginning to outline itself before his eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连痛苦的目光颇为严厉，他观察德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生，注意到这个可爱而善良的年轻人认为神秘原因具有非常的影响力。如果他看见一个稍许重要些的事件被归结为一个简单而十分自然的原因，他甚至会伤心，生气。“这可有点儿发疯了，”他心想。“这种性格跟科拉索夫亲王向我描述过的亚历山大皇帝的性格有明显的联系。”可怜的于连走出神学院，来到巴黎的头一年，这些可爱的年轻人的风度对他来说是那么新鲜，看得他眼花缭乱，唯有赞叹而已。只是此刻，他们的真正性格方才开始呈现在他的眼前。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am playing an undignified part here,' he suddenly decided. The next thing was  how to leave his little cane chair in a fashion that should not be too awkward.  He tried to think of one, he called for something original upon an imagination  that was fully occupied elsewhere. He was obliged to draw upon his memory,  which, it must be confessed, was by no means rich in resources of this order;  the boy was still a thorough novice, so that his awkwardness was complete and  attracted everyone's attention when he rose to leave the drawing-room. Misery  was all too evident in his whole deportment. He had been playing the part for  three quarters of an hour of a troublesome inferior from whom people do not  take the trouble to conceal what they think of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不配呆在这里，”他突然想到。问题是如何离开那小草垫椅子，又不显笨拙，他想找出个办法，他向被别的事情占得满满的想象力要求点新东西。应该求助于记忆，然而他的记忆中，应该承认，此类资源并不丰富。可怜的孩子还非常缺乏阅历，因此他起身离开客厅时，显得十分苯拙，人人都看在眼里。在他整个的态度中，不幸表现得太明显。三刻钟以来，他一直扮演着一个讨人嫌的下属的角色，他们甚至懒得掩饰对他的看法。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  critical observations which he had been making at the expense of his rivals  prevented him, however, from taking his misfortune too seriously; he retained,  to give support to his pride, the memory of what had occurred the night before  last. 'Whatever the advantages they may have over me,' he thought as he went  into the garden by himself, 'Mathilde has not been to any of them what, on two  occasions in my life, she has deigned to be to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，他对这些情敌们所作的批评性观察毕竟阻止他把自己的不幸看得过于悲惨；他拥有对前两天发生的事情的回忆来支撑他的自豪感。“无论他们有什么超过我的地方，”他一个人走进花园时想，“玛蒂尔德屈尊俯就，他们谁也没有，可是我这辈子却有过两次。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  sagacity went no farther. He failed entirely to understand the character of the  singular person whom chance had now made absolute mistress of his whole  happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的智慧就此止步。这个奇女子，命运刚刚让她做了他全部幸福的绝对主宰，而他却根本不理解她的性格。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  devoted the next day to killing himself and his horse with exhaustion. He made  no further attempt, that evening, to approach the blue sofa to which Mathilde  was faithful. He remarked that Comte Norbert did not so much as deign to look  at him when they met in the house. 'He must be making an extraordinary effort,'  he thought, 'he who is naturally so polite.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天，他坚持要用疲劳毁掉他自己和他的马。晚上，他不想再靠近那张蓝色长沙发了，玛蒂尔德依旧坐在那儿。他注意别诺贝尔伯爵在房子里碰见他时，甚至不肯看他一眼。“他一定是做出了不寻常的努力来强迫自己，他平时是那样地有礼貌。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  Julien, sleep would have meant happiness. Despite his bodily exhaustion,  memories of a too seductive kind began to invade his whole imagination. He had  not the intelligence to see that by his long rides through the forests round  Paris, acting only upon himself and in no way upon the heart or mind of  Mathilde, he was leaving the arrangement of his destiny to chance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对于连来说，睡眠可能即是幸福。尽管身体疲惫不够，回忆毕竟诱人，又开始侵入他的全部想象之中。他还没有那样的天才，看不出他在巴黎附近的森林中纵马驰骋，是把他的命运交由偶然支配，受影响的只是他自己，对玛蒂尔德的感情或精神毫无触动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  seemed to him that one thing would supply boundless comfort to his grief:  namely to speak to Mathilde. And yet what could he venture to say to her?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他觉得有一件事可以给他的痛苦带来永远的缓解：跟玛蒂尔德说话。然而他敢吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was the question upon which one morning at seven o'clock he was pondering  deeply, when suddenly he saw her enter the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天早晨七点钟，他想得正深，突然后见她到图书室来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  know, Sir, that you desire to speak to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我知道，先生，您想跟我说话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Great  God! Who told you that?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伟大的天主！谁告诉您的？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  know it, what more do you want? If you are lacking in honour, you may ruin me,  or at least attempt to do so; but this danger, which I do not regard as real,  will certainly not prevent me from being sincere. I no longer love you, Sir; my  wild imagination misled me …'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这与您何干？反正我知道。如果您没有荣誉观念，您可以毁掉我，或者至少可以试一试；然而我不相信这种危险是真实的，它当然不能阻止我说真话。我不爱您了，先生，我那疯狂的想象欺骗了我……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  receiving this terrible blow, desperate with love and misery, Julien tried to  excuse himself. Nothing could be more absurd. Does one excuse oneself for  failing to please? But reason no longer held any sway over his actions. A blind  instinct urged him to postpone the decision of his fate. It seemed to him that  so long as he was still speaking, nothing was definitely settled. Mathilde did  not listen to his words, the sound of them irritated her, she could not  conceive how he had the audacity to interrupt her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连被爱情和不幸搅得狂乱不能自制，受此可怕的一击，想为自己辩白几句。荒谬绝伦。惹人讨厌是可以辩白的事吗？然而理智已经不再对他的行动有任何的威力了。一种盲目的本能驱使他延缓对命运作出决定。他觉得只要他在说话，一切就还没有结束。玛蒂尔德听不进他的话，他说话的声音激怒了她，她想不到他竟敢打断她。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  twofold remorse of her virtue and her pride made her, that morning, equally  unhappy. She was more or less crushed by the frightful idea of having given  certain rights over herself to a little cleric, the son of a peasant. 'It is  almost,' she told herself in moments when she exaggerated her distress, 'as  though I had to reproach myself with a weakness for one of the footmen.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>源于道德的悔恨和源于骄傲的悔恨也使她这天早晨感到不幸。想到曾经把一些支配自己的权利交给一个小神甫，农民的儿子，她真可以说是惊恐万状了。她有时对自己说：“这差不多就像是我责备自己失身于一个仆人。”这是她夸大了自己的不幸。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  bold and proud natures, it is only a step from anger with oneself to fury with  other people; one's transports of rage are in such circumstances a source of  keen pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>就大胆而高傲的性格而言，对自己生气和对别人发火，其间只有一步之差；在这种情况下，暴跳如雷乃是一种强烈的快乐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  a moment, Mademoiselle de La Mole reached the stage of heaping on Julien the  marks of the most intense scorn. She had infinite cleverness, and this  cleverness triumphed in the art of torturing the self-esteem of others and  inflicting cruel wounds upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一时间，德·拉莫尔小姐竟至于对于连表示出最过分的轻蔑。她有无穷的才智，而这种才智最擅胜场的艺术是折磨人的自尊心并使之受到残酷的创伤。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  the first time in his life, Julien found himself subjected to the action of a  superior intelligence animated by the most violent hatred of himself.So  far from entertaining the slightest idea of defending himself at that moment,  he began to despise himself. Hearing her heap upon him such cruel marks of  scorn, so cleverly calculated to destroy any good opinion that he might have of  himself, he felt that Mathilde was right, and that she was not saying enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>生平第一次，于连被迫在一个对他充满最强烈仇恨的高超才智面前屈服了。此时此刻，他非但毫无维护自己的意思，反而轻蔑起自己来了。她那些轻蔑的表示如此残酷，经过如此巧妙的算计好来摧毁他可能对自己有的一切好看法，朝他劈头盖脸地压下来，他听了竟觉得玛蒂尔德说得对，而且说得还不够。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for her, her pride found an exquisite pleasure in thus punishing herself and  him for the adoration which she had felt a few days earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她呢，她为了几天前感受到的爱慕之情而这样惩罚自己，惩罚他，从中感到了一种充满了骄傲的无穷乐趣。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  had no need to invent or to think for the first time of the cruel words which  she now uttered with such complacence. She was only repeating what for the last  week had been said in her heart by the counsel of the opposite party to love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那些残酷的话，她也是第一次不需要冥思苦想就如此得意地脱口而出。她只是在重复反对爱情的一方的辩护士一周来在她心里说过的话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Every  word increased Julien's fearful misery an hundredfold. He tried to escape,  Mademoiselle de La Mole held him by the arm with a gesture of authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>每句话都使于连那可怕的不幸增加一百倍。他想逃，德·拉莫尔小姐一把抓住他的胳膊，威风凛凛。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Please  to observe,' he said to her, 'that you are speaking extremely loud; they will  hear you in the next room.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请您注意，”他对她说，“您说话声音太高，隔壁房间的人会听见的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  of that!' Mademoiselle de La Mole retorted proudly, 'who will dare to say to me  that he has heard me? I wish to rid your petty self-esteem forever of the ideas  which it may have formed of me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有什么关系！”德·拉莫尔小姐傲慢地说，“谁敢对我说他听见了我的话？我要根治您那小小的自尊心可能对我抱有的种种念头。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  Julien was able to leave the library, he was so astounded that he already felt  his misery less keenly. 'Well! She no longer loves me,' he repeated to himself,  speaking aloud as though to inform himself of his position. 'It appears that  she loved me for a week or ten days, and I shall love her all my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当于连终于能够离开图书室的时候，他感到惊奇，他居然不那么强烈地感到不幸了。“好啊！她不爱我了，”他一遍遍高声自言自语，好像是要把自己的处境告诉自己。“后来她爱了我八天或十天，而我呢，我却要爱她一辈子。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is  it really possible, she meant nothing, nothing at all to my heart, only a few  days ago.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道这是可能的吗？不多天以前，她还不算什么！在我心中不算什么！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  delights of satisfied pride flooded Mathilde's bosom; so she had managed to  break with him forever! The thought of so complete a triumph over so strong an  inclination made her perfectly happy. 'And so this little gentleman will understand,  and once for all, that he has not and never will have any power over me.' She  was so happy that really she had ceased to feel any love at that moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>骄傲的满足淹没了玛蒂尔德的心；她终于能永远地一刀两断了！如此彻底地战胜了如此强烈的倾慕，这使她感到非常幸福。“这样一来，这位小先生就会明白，而且是一劳永逸地明白，他没有，也永远不会有支配我的力量。”她是那样地幸福，此时此刻她确实是没有爱情了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  so atrocious, so humiliating a scene, in anyone less passionate than Julien,  love would have become impossible. Without departing for a single instant from  what she owed to herself, Mademoiselle de La Mole had addressed to him certain  of those disagreeable statements, so well calculated that they can appear to be  true, even when one remembers them in cold blood.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过如此残忍、如此令人屈辱的一幕之后，对于一个不像于连那么热情洋溢的人来说，爱情会变得不可能。德·拉莫尔小姐一刻也不曾离开过她对自己的责任，她对他说的那些令人难堪的话，虽说经过了周密的算计，看起来仍可能是真话，甚至当他静下心来回想的时候，也是如此。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The conclusion that Julien drew at the  first moment from so astonishing a scene was that Mathilde had an unbounded  pride. He believed firmly that everything was at an end for ever between them,  and yet, the following day, at luncheon, he was awkward and timid in her  presence.This  was a fault that could not have been found with him until then. In small  matters as in great, he knew clearly what he ought and wished to do, and  carried it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一开始从这惊人的一暮中得出的结论是，玛蒂尔德的骄傲无边无际。他坚信他们之间一切都永远地结束了，可是到了第二天，吃中饭的时候，他在她面前却是既笨拙又胆怯。在此之前，我们还不能指责他有这样的缺点。大事小事，他清楚地知道该做什么，想做什么，并且付诸实践。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  day, after luncheon, when Madame de La Mole asked him for a seditious and at  the same time quite rare pamphlet, which her parish priest had brought to her  secretly that morning, Julien, in taking it from a side table, knocked over an  old vase of blue porcelain, the ugliest thing imaginable.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一天，吃过中饭，德·拉莫尔夫人要他递给她一本煽动性的但颇罕见的小册子，那是她的本堂神甫早上偷偷带给她的。于连从靠墙的小桌上拿起小册子时，碰倒了一个蓝色的旧瓷瓶，这瓷瓶可真是要多难看有多难看了。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de La Mole rose to her feet with a cry of distress and came across the room to  examine the fragments of her beloved vase. 'It was old Japan,' she said, 'it  came to me from my greataunt the Abbess of Chelles;it was a present from the  Dutch to the Duke of Orleans when he was Regent and he gave it to his daughter  … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔夫人伤心地叫了一声，站起来，过去就近察看她心爱的花瓶的碎片。“这是日本古瓶，”她说，“是从我那当谢尔修道院院长的姑婆那里得来的，这是荷兰人送给摄政王奥尔良公爵的一件礼物，他又给了他女儿……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  had followed her mother, delighted to see the destruction of this blue vase  which seemed to her horribly ugly. Julien stood silent and not unduly  distressed; he saw Mademoiselle de La Mole standing close beside him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div
<p>玛蒂尔德跟着母亲，很高兴看见这个蓝瓶子被打碎，她觉得它难看得吓人。于连不说话，也不太荒乱；他看见德·拉莫尔小姐就在他身边。</p>
></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  vase,' he said to her, 'is destroyed for ever; so is it with a sentiment which  was once the master of my heart; I beg you to accept my apologies for all the  foolish things it has made me do'; and he left the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这花瓶，”他对她说，“永远地毁了，曾经主宰我的心的一种感情也永远地毁了；它曾使我做出种种疯狂的事情，请您接受我的道歉。”他说完，扬长而去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Really,  one would think,' said Madame de La Mole as he went, 'that this M. Sorel is  proud and delighted with what he has done.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说实在的，”德·拉尔尔夫人在他走开的时候说，“好像这位索莱尔先生对他刚刚做的事感到自豪和满意似的。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  speech fell like a weight upon Mathilde's heart. 'It is true,' she told  herself, 'my mother has guessed aright, such is the sentiment that is animating  him.' Then and then only ended her joy in the scene that she had made with him  the day before. 'Ah, well, all is at an end,' she said to herself with apparent  calm; 'I am left with a great example; my mistake has been fearful, degrading!  It will make me wise for all the rest of my life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话直接说到了玛蒂尔德的心坎上。“的确，”她心想，“我母亲猜得准，这正是他此刻的感情。”到了这个时候，她前一天跟他吵了一场后感到的快乐才消失。“得，一切都结束了，”她对自己说，表面上很平静，“我得了一个大教训；这个错误是可怕的，令人感到屈辱！它会让我在以后的生活里变得聪明。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Was  I not speaking the truth?' thought Julien; 'why does the love that I felt for  that mad woman torment me still?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道我说的不是真的吗？”于连想，“为什么我对这个疯丫头有过的爱情还在折磨我呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  love, so far from dying, as he hoped, was making rapid strides.'She  is mad, it is true,' he said to himself, 'but is she any less adorable? Is it  possible for a girl to be more lovely? Everything that the most elegant  civilisation can offer in the way of keen pleasures, was it not all combined to  one's heart's content in Mademoiselle de La Mole?' These memories of past  happiness took possession of Julien, and rapidly undid all the work of reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这爱情非但没有如他所感地熄灭，反而在迅速地增长。“她疯了，的确，”他对自己说，“然而她因此就不那么可爱了吗？一个女人还能比她更漂亮吗？最高雅的文明所能呈献的给人以最强烈快乐的那些东西不是都抢着聚集在德·拉莫尔小姐身上吗？”对往日幸福的这些回忆抓住了于连，迅速地摧毁了理智的一切成果。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Reason  struggles in vain against memories of this sort; its stern endeavours serve  only to enhance their charm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>理智徒劳地和此类回忆斗争，它那些艰难的尝试只能增加回忆的魅力。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Twenty-four  hours after the breaking of the old Japanese vase, Julien was decidedly one of  the unhappiest of men.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>打碎日本古瓶二十四个钟头之后，于连显然成了最不幸的人。
