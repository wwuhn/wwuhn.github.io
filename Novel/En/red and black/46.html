<div class="layout">
<div class="left quo1 ">
<p>The  garden was extremely large, laid out with perfect taste just a few years  previously. But the trees were over a century old. The place had something  rustic about it.</p>
<p>MASSINGER</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>这座花园特别大，是几年前以无比高超的审美力设计的。但是那些树都是百年以上的老树。园子里有几分乡村风味。</p>
<p>马辛吉尔</p></div>
</div>
 
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>He  was on the point of countermanding his instructions to Fouque when the clock  struck eleven. He came out of his bedroom and shut the door behind him, turning  the key noisily in the lock, as though he were locking himself in. He prowled  round the house to see what was afoot everywhere, especially on the fourth  floor, where the servants slept.There  was nothing unusual. One of Madame de La Mole's maids was giving a party, the  servants were merrily imbibing punch. 'The men who are laughing like that,'  thought Julien, 'cannot have been detailed for the midnight encounter, they  would be more serious.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他正要给富凯写信，取消原来的决定，十一点的钟声响了。他转动房门的钥匙，弄得哗啦哗啦响，像是已把自己锁在了屋里。他蹑手蹑脚地去观察整座房子，尤其是仆人们住的五楼。没有任何异常。德·拉莫尔夫人的一个女仆在举行晚会，男仆们在兴高采烈地喝潘趣酒。“笑成这样的那些人，”于连想，“大概不参加夜里的行动，他们应该更严肃才是。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Finally  he took his stand in a dark corner of the garden. 'If their plan is to avoid  the notice of the servants of the house, they will make the men they have hired  to seize me come in over the garden wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>最后，他到花园的一个黑乎乎的角落里站定。“如果他们的计划是瞒着家里的仆人，他们会让负责抓我的人从花园的墙上爬过来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  M. de Croisenois is taking all this calmly, he must feel that it will be less  compromising for the young person whom he intends to marry to have me seized  before the moment when I shall have entered her room.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生在这件事中稍许冷静些，他应该在我进入她的房间之前就让人把我抓起来，让他想娶的人的名誉少受些损害。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  made an extremely careful military reconnaissance. 'My honour is at stake,' he  thought; 'if I make some blunder, it will be no excuse in my own eyes to say to  myself: &quot;I never thought of that.&quot;'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他作了一番军事侦察，而且非常精确。“事关我的名誉，”他想；“如果我干出什么蠢事，我自己都认为没有理由对自己说：我没有想到。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  sky was maddeningly clear. About eleven o'clock the moon rose, at half past  twelve it lighted the whole garden front of the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>天气晴朗，没什么主意好打。十一点左右，月亮升起来了，十二点半的时候，已经把府邸朝花园的那面墙照得通亮。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  is mad,' Julien said to himself; when one o'clock struck, there was still a  light in Comte Norbert's windows. Never in his life had Julien been so much  afraid, he saw only the dangers of the enterprise, and felt not the least  enthusiasm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她真是疯了，”于连心想；一点的钟声响了，诺贝尔伯爵的窗子还有灯光。于连一辈子还没有这么害怕过，他只看到这次出击的种种危险，没有丝毫的热情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  went to fetch the huge ladder, waited five minutes, to allow time for a  countermand, and at five minutes past one placed the ladder against Mathilde's  window. He climbed quietly, pistol in hand, astonished not to find himself  attacked. As he reached the window, she opened it silently:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他去搬那架巨大的梯子，等了五分钟，看看她会不会改变主意；一点五分，他把梯子靠在玛蒂尔德的窗口上。他手上拿着抢，慢慢地往上爬，奇怪居然没有受到攻击。他到了窗前的时候，窗子无声地开了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Here  you are, Sir,' Mathilde said to him with deep emotion; 'I have been following  your movements for the last hour.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您来啦，先生，”玛蒂尔德对他说，非常激动，“我看了您一个钟头了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was greatly embarrassed, he did not know how to behave, he did not feel the  least vestige of love. In his embarrassment, he decided that he must show  courage, he attempted to embrace Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连感到很局促，不知如何是好，他根本就没有爱情。窘迫中，他想应该大胆，就试图拥抱玛蒂尔德。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Fie,  Sir!' she said, and thrust him from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不！”她说，把他推开。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Greatly  relieved at this repulse, he hastened to cast an eye round the room: the  moonlight was so brilliant that the shadows which it formed in Mademoiselle de  La Mole's room were black. 'There may easily be men concealed there without my  seeing them,' he thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他很高兴遭到拒绝，急忙向周围扫了一眼；月光很亮，照得德·拉莫尔小姐房间里的影子分外地黑。“很可能那边藏着一些人，而我看不见。”他想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  have you in the side pocket of your coat?' Mathilde asked him, delighted at  finding a topic of conversation. She was strangely ill at ease; all the  feelings of reserve and timidity, so natural to a young girl of good family,  had resumed their sway and were keeping her on tenterhooks.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您衣服的侧兜里放的是什么？”玛蒂尔德对他说，很高兴找到了话题。她感到不同寻常地痛苦，一个出身高贵的女孩子自然具有的那种矜持感和羞怯感又占了上风，折磨着她。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have all sorts of weapons and pistols,' replied Julien, no less pleased at  having something to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我有各种武器和手枪，”于连答道，因为找到点儿什么说而跟她一样地高兴。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  must pull up the ladder,' said Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“应该把梯子拉上来，”玛蒂尔德说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is huge, and may break the windows of the room below, or of the mezzanine.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“梯子太大，会碰碎下面客厅或夹层的玻璃窗。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  must not break the windows,' Mathilde went on, trying in vain to adopt the tone  of ordinary conversation; 'you might, it seems to me, let the ladder down by  means of a cord tied to the top rung. I always keep a supply of cords by me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“不应该碰碎玻璃窗，”玛蒂尔德试着用平常谈话的口气，可是不行，“我看您可以用绳子拴在梯子的第一蹬上，把梯子放倒。我屋里经常准备着绳子。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  this is a woman in love!' thought Julien, 'she dares to say that she loves!  Such coolness, such sagacity in her precautions make it plain to me that I am  not triumphing over M. de Croisenois, as I foolishly imagined; but am simply  becoming his successor. After all, what does it matter? I am not in love! I  triumph over the Marquis in this sense, that he will be greatly annoyed at  having a successor, and still more annoyed that his successor should be myself.  How arrogantly he stared at me last night in the Cafe Tortoni, pretending not  to know me! How savagely he bowed to me afterwards, when he could no longer  avoid it!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是一个动了情的女人！”于连想，“她敢说出她爱上了。她在这些预防措施中表现出如此的冷静、如此的聪明，足以让我知道，我并没有战胜德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生，我真愚蠢，我不过是接替了他罢了。事实上，这有什么关系！难道我爱她吗？他有一个接替者，这会让他大为恼火，这个接替者是我，就更让他恼火，在这个意义上我战胜了侯爵。咋天晚上在托尔托尼咖啡馆他是多么傲慢地看着我呀，竟然装作没有认出我来！后来他实在躲不过去了，但他向我致意时神情多么凶恶！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had fastened the cord to the highest rung of the ladder, he now let it down  gently, leaning far out over the balcony so as to see that it did not touch the  windows. 'A fine moment for killing me,' he thought, 'if there is anyone hidden  in Mathilde's room'; but a profound silence continued to reign everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连把绳子系在梯子的一端，慢慢地放倒。身子尽量探出阳台外，不便梯子碰着玻璃窗。“这可是个杀死我的好机会，如果有人藏在玛蒂尔德的房里。”然而到处依然是一片沉寂。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  head of the ladder touched the ground. Julien succeeded in concealing it in the  bed of exotic flowers that ran beneath the wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>梯子触到地面，于连设法让它顺卧在墙边种着奇花异草的花坛里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  will my mother say,' said Mathilde, 'when she sees her beautiful plants all  ruined! You must throw down the cord,' she went on, with perfect calm. 'If it  were seen running up to the balcony, it would be difficult to explain its  presence.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我母亲看见她的美丽的花草都被压坏了，”玛蒂尔德说，“会说什么呀！……得把绳子扔掉，”她又极其冷静地说，“如果有人看见绳子直通到阳台上，那可就说不清了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And how me gwine get way?' asked Julien,  in a playful tone, imitating Creole speech. (One of the maids in the house was  a native of San Domingo.)</p>
</div>
<div
<p>“怎么我的出去？”于连学着克里奥尔语，开玩笑地说。（家里有个女仆出生在圣多明各。）</p>
 class="right">

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  get way by the door,' said Mathilde, delighted at this solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您从门口出去，”玛蒂尔德说，对这个主意感到很高兴。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  How worthy this man is of all my love,' she thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！这个人真配得上我全部的爱！”她想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had just let the cord drop into the garden; Mathilde gripped him by the arm. He  thought he was being seized by an enemy, and turned sharply round drawing a  dagger. She thought she had heard a window being opened. They stood motionless,  without breathing. The moon shone full upon them. As the sound was not  repeated, there was no further cause for alarm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连刚把绳子扔进花园，玛蒂尔德就一把抓住了他的胳膊。他以为敌人来了，猛地转过身，同时拔出了匕首。她相信听见了一个窗子打开的声音。他们屏住呼吸，一动不动，月亮正照着他们。声者没有再出现，不必再紧张了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Then  their embarrassment began again, and was great on both sides.Julien  made sure that the door was fastened with all its bolts; he even thought of  looking under the bed, but dared not; they might have hidden a footman or two  there. Finally, the fear of a subsequent reproach from his prudence made him  look.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，窘迫又开始了，双方都深有所感。于连看了看，门上的插销都插上了；他还想看看床下，但是不敢；那底下可能安置了一、两个仆人。最后，他害怕日后会责备自己不谨慎，还是看了看。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  had succumbed to all the agonies of extreme shyness. She felt a horror of her  position.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德陷在极度羞怯引起的苦恼中，她憎恶自己的处境。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  have you done with my letters?' she said, at length.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您是怎么处理我的信的？”她终于问道。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a fine opportunity to discomfit these gentlemen, if they are listening, and so  avoid the conflict!' thought Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“多好的机会啊，如果这些先生们在偷听，他们可该为难了，战斗也能避免了！”于连想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  first is hidden in a stout Protestant Bible which last night's mail has carried  far from here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第一封藏在一本很大的新载《圣经》里，昨晚的驿车已把它带到很远的地方了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  spoke very distinctly as he entered into these details, and in such a way as to  be overheard by anyone who might be concealed in two great mahogany wardrobes  which he had not dared to examine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他讲了种种细节，声音清晰，好让可能藏在两个衣橱里的人听清楚，他没敢查那两个衣橱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  other two are in the post, and are going the same way as the first.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“另外两封也到了邮局，要和第一封走同样的路线。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good  Lord! But why all these precautions?' said Mathilde, with astonishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伟大的天主！为什么要有这么多的戒备？”玛蒂尔德惊讶地问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is  there any reason why I should lie to her?' thought Julien; and he confessed to  her all his suspicions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我为什么要说谎呢？”于连想，就把他的猜疑合盘托出。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  that accounts for the coldness of thy letters!' cried Mathilde, in accents  rather of frenzy than of affection.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“原来这就是你的信写得那么冷淡的原因啊！”玛蒂尔德叫道，口吻中疯狂多于温柔。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  did not observe her change of tone. This use of the singular pronoun made him  lose his head, or at least his suspicions vanished; he ventured to clasp in his  arms this girl who was so beautiful and inspired such respect in him. He was  only half repulsed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连没有注意到这个细微的差别。话中的“你”让他昏了头，至少他的疑心已化为乌有，他大着胆子把这个如此美丽、使他如此敬重的站娘抱在怀里。他没有遭到完全地拒绝。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  had recourse to his memory, as once before, long ago, at Besancon with Amanda  Binet, and repeated several of the finest passages from the Nouvelle Heloise.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他又求助于记忆，像从前在贝藏松和阿芒达·比奈在一起时那样，背诵了好几句《新爱洛缔斯》中最美的句子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Thou  hast a man's heart,' she replied, without paying much attention to what he was  saying; 'I wished to test thy bravery, I admit. Thy first suspicions and thyu  determination to come shew thee to be even more intrepid than I supposed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你有男子汉的胆量，”她说，没有怎么听他那些漂亮句子，“我承认，我想考验考验你的勇气。你最初的那些猜疑和你的决心证明了你比我想象的还要勇敢。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  made an effort to use the more intimate form; she was evidently more attentive  to this unusual way of speaking than to what she was saying. This use of the tu  form, stripped of the tone of affection, ceased, after a moment, to afford  Julien any pleasure, he was astonished at the absence of happiness; finally, in  order to feel it, he had recourse to his reason. He saw himself highly esteemed  by this girl who was so proud, and never bestowed unrestricted praise; by this  line of reasoning he arrived at a gratification of his self-esteem.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德努力用“你”来称呼他，显然，比起说活的内容，她把更多的注意力花在这种奇特的说话方式上了。这种剥除了温情的你我相称没有使于连感到一点点快乐；他奇怪怎么一点儿幸福也没有，最后，他为了有所感，就求助于理智。他看到自己受到这个女孩于的敬重，而她是那么高傲，从不无保留地称赞人；如此这般，他终于感到一种自尊心得到满足的幸福。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was not, it is true, that spiritual ecstasy which he had found at times in the  company of Madame de Renal. There was nothing tender in his sentiments at this  first moment. What he felt was the keenest gratification of his ambition, and  Julien was above all things ambitious. He spoke again of the people he  suspected and of the precautions he had contrived. As he spoke he was thinking  of how best to profit by his victory.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>说真的，这不是他有时在德·莱纳夫人身边得到的那种精神上的满足。在这最初时刻萌发的情感中，一点儿柔情解结的东西也没有。那是一种野心实现后感到的狂喜，而于连恰恰是有野心的。他又谈起他猜疑的那些人和他想出来的种种防范措施。他一边谈，一边想看如何利用他的胜利。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde,  who was still greatly embarrassed and had the air of one appalled by what she  had done, seemed enchanted at finding a topic of conversation. They discussed  how they should meet again. Julien employed to the full the intelligence and  daring of which he furnished fresh proofs in the course of this discussion.  They had some extremely sharp sighted people against them, young Tanbeau was  certainly a spy, but Mathilde and he were not altogether incompetent either.What  could be easier than to meet in the library, and arrange everything?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德还是很窘迫，好像给自己的行为吓呆了，能找到一个话题，自然也显得很高兴。他们谈到以后见面的办法。讨论再次证明了他的才智和勇气，他心里美滋滋的。他们要对付的是些很精明的人，小唐博肯定是个奸细，但是玛蒂尔德和他也不是笨蛋。说到底，到图书室会面不是最容易的吗？</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  can appear, without arousing suspicion, in any part of the house, I could  almost appear in Madame de La Mole's bedroom.' It was absolutely necessary to  pass through this room to reach her daughter's. If Mathilde preferred that he  should always come by a ladder, it was with a heart wild with joy that he would  expose himself to this slight risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我可以去府里任何地方而不引起疑心，”于连说，“甚至几乎能去德·拉莫尔夫人的卧室。”要到她女儿的卧室必得经过她的卧室。如果玛蒂尔德认为还是爬梯子好，他会怀着一颗欣喜若狂的心来冒这个小小的危险。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  she listened to him speaking, Mathilde was shocked by his air of triumph. 'He  is my master, then!' she told herself. Already she was devoured by remorse. Her  reason felt a horror of the signal act of folly which she had just committed.  Had it been possible, she would have destroyed herself and Julien. Whenever,  for an instant, the strength of her will made her remorse silent, feelings of  shyness and outraged modesty made her extremely wretched. She had never for a  moment anticipated the dreadful plight in which she now found herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>玛蒂尔德听他说话，对他那志得意满的神气颇反感。“这么说他是我的主人了，”她心里说。她已经后悔了。她的理智对她刚刚干出的这件极其荒唐的事情深感厌恶。如果她能，她一定会把她自己和于连一起杀掉。当她的意志力暂时把悔恨压下去的时候，她又感到了羞怯，感到贞洁受到了伤害，因此痛苦不堪。她无论如何不曾料到自己会落到这种可怕的境地。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  must speak to him, though,' she said to herself, finally, 'that is laid down in  the rules, one speaks to one's lover.' And then, as though performing a duty,  and with a tenderness that was evident rather in the words that she used than  in the sound of her voice, she told him of the various decisions to which she  had come with regard to him during the last few days.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过我总得跟他说话呀，”她最后对自己说，“跟情人说话，这是理所应当的。”于是，为了履行一项义务，她怀着柔情把这几天她为他作出的决定一一讲给他听，不过这种柔情更多地表现在言辞里，而不是表现在她说话的声音里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  had made up her mind that if he ventured to come to her with the aid of the  gardener's ladder, as she had bidden him, she would give herself to him. But  never were things so tender said in a colder and more formal tone. So far,  their intercourse was icebound. It was enough to make one hate the thought of  love. What a moral lesson for a rash young woman! Is it worth her while to  wreck her future for such a moment?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她曾经决定，如果他敢于像规定给他的那样，借助园丁的梯子爬进她的房间，她就把自己给了他。但是，把这种温情脉脉的话说出口，不会有人比她的口吻更冷淡、更客气了。到此为止，这次幽会一直是冷冰冰的。这简直是把爱情当成了仇恨。对于一个不谨慎的女孩子来说，这是怎样的道德教训啊！为了这样的一刻，值得毁掉自己的未来吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  prolonged uncertainties, which might have appeared to a superficial observer to  be due to the most decided hatred, so hard was it for the feeling of  self-respect which a woman owes to herself, to yield to so masterful a will,  Mathilde finally became his mistress.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过长时间的犹豫，玛蒂尔德终于做了他可爱的情妇。一个肤浅的观察者可能会觉得这犹豫乃是—种最坚决的仇恨的结果，殊不知，一个女人自然萌生的情感要收回去有多么难啊，即使碰上她那样坚强的意志也一样。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>To  tell the truth, their transports were somewhat deliberate. Passionate love was  far more a model which they were imitating than a reality with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>实际上，他们的热狂有些勉强。热烈的爱情与其说是现实，不如说是一种模仿的式样。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole believed that she was performing a duty to wards herself and towards  her lover. 'The poor boy,' she told herself, 'has been the last word in daring,  he deserves to be made happy, or else I am wanting in character.' But she would  gladly have redeemed at the cost of an eternity of suffering the cruel  necessity to which she found herself committed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐认为她是在对自己和情人尽义务。“可怜的孩子”她对自己说，“他表现出了十足的勇气，他应该幸福，不然就是我没有性格。”然而，她宁愿以永恒的不幸为代价，摆脱她正在履行的残酷职责。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  spite of the violence she was doing to herself, she retained entire command of  her speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不管她对自己的强迫多么可怕，她还是完全地履行了诺言。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>No  regret, no reproach came to mar this night which seemed odd rather than happy  to Julien. What a difference, great God, from his last visit, of twenty-four  hours, to Verrieres! 'These fine Paris manners have found out the secret of  spoiling everything, even love,' he said to himself with an extreme disregard  of justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>没有任何悔恨，也没有任何责备，来破坏这个夜晚，在于连看来，这一夜与其是幸福的，还不如说是奇特的。伟大的天主！跟他最后在维里埃度过的那二十四小时相比，有多大的不同啊！“巴黎的这些高雅规矩找到了败坏一切甚至爱情的秘诀，”他对自己说，不过这对他就极不公正了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  abandoned himself to these reflections, standing upright in one of the great  mahogany wardrobes into which he had been thrust at the first sound heard from  the next room, which was Madame de La Mole's bed room. Mathilde accompanied her  mother to mass, the maids soon left the apartment, and Julien easily made his  escape before they returned to complete their labours.</p>

<p>他站在大衣橱里，脑子里尽是这样的想法。那是在听见隔壁德·拉莫尔夫人的房里第一声响动时，玛蒂尔德让他钻进去的。玛蒂尔德跟着母亲望弥撒去了，女仆们很快离开了套房。于连赶在她们回来结束工作之前，很容易地溜走了。</p>

<p>He  mounted his horse and made at a leisurely pace for the most solitary recesses  of one of the forests near Paris. He was still more surprised than happy. The  happiness which, from time to time, came flooding into his heart, was akin to  that of a young Second Lieutenant who, after some astounding action, has just  been promoted Colonel by the Commander in Chief; he felt himself carried to an  immense height.

<p>如果他的心灵里没有丝毫的柔情，那是因为玛蒂尔德对待他的全部行为，不管听上去多么奇怪，是在履行一种责任。对她来说，那天夜里发生的一件件事都平淡无奇，她没有发现小说里说的那种圆满的极乐，她只发现了不幸和羞耻。</p>

<p>'Can  I have been mistaken? Am I not in love with him?' she asked herself.</p>

<p>“是我弄错了？难道我对他没有爱情？”她对自己说。
