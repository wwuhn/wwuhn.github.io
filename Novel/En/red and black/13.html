  <div class="left"><p>When  Julien caught sight of the picturesque ruins of the old church of Vergy, it  occurred to him that for two whole days he had not once thought of Madame de  Renal. The other day, as I was leaving, that woman reminded me of the vast gulf  that separates us, she treated me like a workman's son. No doubt she wished to  show me that she repented of having let me hold her hand the night before… It  is a lovely hand, all the same! What charm, what nobility dwells in that  woman's glance!' </p>
  

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连又看见了韦尔吉那座老教堂的如画的废墟，这才注意到，从前天晚上到现在，他竟一次也没有想到德·莱纳夫人。“那天临走时，这个女人提醒我，我们之间的距离不啻天壤，她像对待一个工人的儿子那样对待我。无疑，她想向我表明，她后悔头天晚上让我握住她的手……可这只手真美呀！这个女人的目光中有着怎样一种魅力、怎样一种高贵呀！”</p>

</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">
  
  
<p>The possibility of making a fortune with Fouque gave a certain  facility to the course of Julien's reasoning; it was less often interrupted by  irritation, and the keen sense of his own poverty and humble position in the eyes  of the world. As though perched on a lofty promontory, he  was able to judge, and, so to speak, overlooked extreme poverty on the one hand  and that life of comfort which he still called riches on the other. He was far  from considering his position like a philosopher, but he had sufficient perception  to feel that he was different after this little expedition among the  mountains.</p>

</div>
<div class="right">

<p>和富凯一起发财的可能性使于连的推理顺畅些了；以往他的推理常常受到破坏，或是因为愤怒，或是由于对贫穷和众人眼中的低下的强烈感觉。现在他仿佛站在一块高高的岬角上，能够判断，或者可以说，俯视极端的贫穷和他仍称为富裕的小康。他还远不能以哲人的姿态评判他的处境，但是，他有足够的洞察力感到，这次山间小住之后，他跟以前不同了。</p>

</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">

<p>He was struck by the extreme uneasiness with which Madame de Renal  listened to the short account of his journey, for which she had asked him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>应德·莱纳夫人的请求，他略略讲了讲这次旅行。德·莱纳夫人听着，心情极度慌乱，这使他感到大为惊奇。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fouque  had had thoughts of marriage, unhappy love affairs; the conversation between  the friends had been filled with long confidences of this nature. After finding  happiness too soon, Fouque had discovered that he was not the sole possessor of  his mistress's heart. These disclosures had astonished Julien; he had learned  much that was new to him.His solitary life, compounded of imagination and suspicion,  had kept him aloof from everything that could have enlightened him.</p>

<p> During his  absence, life had been for Madame de Renal nothing more than a succession of  torments, each different but all alike intolerable; she was really ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
  <p>富凯曾经有过结婚的打算，有过不幸的爱情；两个朋友就此深谈了许久。富凯过早地找到了幸福，发觉自己并非唯一被爱的人。这些叙述使于连惊讶，他学到了许多新东西。他的离群索居的生活，完全由想象和狐疑构成的生活，使他远离了一切可以使他明了事理的东西。</p>　　
<p>他不在的这段时间里，生活对于德·莱纳夫人，只不过是各种不同的但全都不堪忍受的折磨；她真的病了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You must not, on  any account,' Madame Derville told her when she saw Julien return, 'feeling as  you do, sit in the garden this evening, the damp air would make you worse.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德尔维夫人见于连回来了，就对她说：“你这样不舒服，今晚就更不要去花园了，潮湿的空气会加重你的病情的。</p>







</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  Derville was surprised to see that her friend, who was always being scolded by  M. de Renal for the undue simplicity of her attire,had put on openwork  stockings and a pair of charming little shoes that had arrived from Paris. For  the last three days Madame de Renal's sole distraction had been to cut out and  make Elisa put together in all haste a summer gown, of a charming little fabric  greatly in fashion. It was just possible to finish this gown a few minutes  after Julien's arrival; Madame de Renal at once put it on. Her friend had no  longer any doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人刚刚穿上一双网眼长袜，还有巴黎来的小巧玲珑的鞋子，德尔维夫人见了，心中一惊，她的朋友一向穿着极朴素，总是为此受到德·莱纳先生的责备。这三天，德·莱纳夫人唯一的乐趣就是裁一条夏裙，用的是一种很时髦的轻薄料子，并且让爱丽莎快快去做。于连到了不久，裙子才刚刚做成，德·莱纳夫人立刻就穿上了。她的朋友不再怀疑。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She is  in love, poor woman!' Madame Derville said to herself. She understood all the  strange symptoms of her illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“她恋爱了，不幸的女人！”德尔维夫人心想。她明白了德·莱纳夫人的种种离奇的症状。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She saw  her speak to Julien. Pallor took the place of the most vivid blushes. Anxiety  stood revealed in her eyes, fastened on those of the young tutor. Madame de  Renal expected every moment that he was going to offer an explanation, and  announce that he was leaving the house,or would remain. It never occurred to  Julien to say anything about this subject, which had not entered his thoughts.  After a terrible struggle,Madame de Renal at last ventured to say to him, in a  tremulous voice, in which the whole extent of her passion lay revealed:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她看着她跟于连说话。最鲜艳的红晕渐渐变作苍白。她的眼睛盯着年轻家庭教师的眼睛，露出了不安。德·莱纳夫人时刻期待着他作出解释，宣布去留。于连没有想到这一层，根本不曾谈及。德·莱纳夫人经过一场痛苦的斗争，终于大着胆子问他，颤抖的声音中充满了激情：</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Are  you going to leave your pupils to take a post elsewhere?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您将离开您的学生到别处去吗？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was struck by her quavering voice and by the look in her eyes.'This woman loves  me,' he said to himself; 'but after this passing weakness for which her pride  is reproaching her, and as soon as she is no longer afraid of my going, she  will return to her arrogance.' This glimpse of their respective positions came  to Julien like a flash of lightning; he replied, hesitatingly:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人迟疑的声音和眼神让于连大吃一惊。  &quot;这个女人爱我，”他心想，“可是她的骄傲会谴责这瞬间的软弱，一旦她不再担心我离开，她会重现她的高傲。”于连闪电般迅速地看见了彼此的地位，就犹豫不决地答道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should greatly regret leaving such attractive and wellborn children,but perhaps  it will be inevitable. A man has duties towards himself also.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“离开这些如此可爱、出身如此高贵的孩子，我会感到非常难过的，可是，也许不得不如此啊。一个人对自己也有应尽的责任。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As he uttered the words well born (this was  one of the aristocratic expressions which Julien had recently acquired), he  burned with a strong feeling of antipathy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>说出出身如此高贵（这是于连新近学会的贵族用语之一）这几个字时，他激动了，心底升起一股憎恶感。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To this woman,' he said to himself, 'I am  not well born.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在这个女人的眼里，我，”他心想，“我不是出身高贵的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal, as she listened to him, was  admiring his intelligence, his beauty, her heart was pierced by the possibility  of departure which he dangled  before her. All her friends from Verrieres who, during Julien's absence, had  come out to dine at Vergy, had almost vied in complimenting her upon the  astonishing young man that her husband had had the good fortune to unearth.  This was not to say that they understood anything of the progress that the  children had made. The fact of his knowing the Bible by heart, and in Latin,  too, had provoked in the inhabitants of Verrieres an admiration that will  endure for, it may be, a century.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人一边听他说，一边欣赏他的才智、他的美貌，他隐约让她看见离去的可能性，这又刺痛了她的心。于连不在的那段时间里，德·莱纳夫人的维里埃的朋友们来韦尔吉吃饭，都争先恐后地夸奖德·莱纳先生有幸挖掘出来的这位奇才。这倒不是说他们对孩子们的进步有什么了解。背诵《圣经》，而且是用拉丁文，这件事就让维里埃的居民们赞叹不已，这也许要持续一个世纪呢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien, who spoke to no one, knew nothing of  all this. If Madame de Renal had had the slightest selfcontrol, she would have  congratulated him on the reputation he had won, and Julien, his pride set at  rest, would have been pleasant and affable to  her, all the more as her new gown seemed to him charming. Madame de Renal, also  pleased with her pretty gown, and with what Julien said to her about it, had  proposed a turn in the garden; soon she had confessed that she was not well enough  to walk. She had taken the returned traveller's arm, and, far from restoring her  strength, the contact of that arm deprived her of what little strength remained  to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连不跟任何人说话，对这一切浑然不知。假使德·莱纳夫人稍微冷静些，就会对他所赢得的声誉表示祝贺，而于连的傲气得到满足，也就会对她温柔、亲切，何况那件连衣裙他又觉得很可爱呢。德·莱纳夫人对这件美丽的连衣裙、对于连关于它说的那些话也感到高兴，早想在花园里转一转，而且很快就说她走不动了，她挽着旅行者的胳膊，然而，接触到他的胳膊，她的力气非但没有增加，反而一点也没有了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It was dark; no sooner were they seated than  Julien, relying on the privilege he had already won, ventured to press his lips  to the arm of his pretty neighbour, and to take her hand. He was thinking of  the boldness which Fouque had used with his mistresses, and not of Madame de  Renal; the phrase well born still weighed upon his heart. His own hand was pressed,  but this afforded him no pleasure. Far from his being proud, or even grateful  for the affection which Madame de Renal betrayed this evening by unmistakable  signs, beauty, elegance, freshness found him almost unconscious of their appeal.  Purity of heart, freedom from any feeling of hatred, serve doubtless to prolong  the duration of youth. It is the face that ages first in the majority of  beautiful women.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>天黑了。大家刚坐下，于连就用起了他那老特权，大胆地把嘴唇挨近漂亮的女邻座的胳膊，握住了她的手，他想的不是德·莱纳夫人，而是富凯对情妇们表现出的大胆，出身高贵这几个字还压在他的心上。她握紧他的手，他竟没有感到丝毫的快乐。对于这天晚上德·莱纳夫人过于明显地流露出来的感情，他一丁点儿自豪感都没有，连起码的感激之情也没有。面对这美貌、优雅和娇艳，他几乎无动于衷，心地纯洁，不存任何仇恨的感情，无疑会延长青春的期限。在大部分漂亮女人那里，最先衰老的是容貌。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien was sullen all the evening; hitherto  he had been angry only with fortune and with society; now that Fouque had  offered him an ignoble way of arriving at comfort, he was angry with himself.  Absorbed in his own thoughts, although now and then he addressed a few words to  the ladies, Julien ended by unconsciously letting go Madame de Renal's hand.  This action completely nonplussed the  poor woman; she saw in it an indication of her fate.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连整个晚上都不高兴，先前他还只是冲着社会的偶然性发怒，自打富凯向他提供了一条致富的肮脏途径之后，他又对着自己生气了。于连一门心思想他的事，虽不时地向两位夫人说几句话，却在不知不觉中放下了德·莱纳夫人的手。这个举动把这可怜的女人的心搅乱了，她从中看见了她的命运的预兆。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Had she been certain of Julien's affection,  her virtue might perhaps have found strength to resist him. Trembling at the  thought of losing him for ever, her passion carried her to the point of seizing  Julien's hand,which, in his distraction, he had allowed to rest upon the back  of a chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她若确信于连的感情，她的贞操也许能找到力量对付他。然而她害怕永远地失去他，于是激情就让她昏了头，她竟又抓住了于连无意中放在椅背上的手。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This action stirred the ambitious youth; he  would have liked it to be witnessed by all those proud nobles who, at table,  when he was at the lower end with the children, used to look at him with so  patronising a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这下可惊醒了这个野心勃勃的年轻人：他真希望所有那些如此傲慢的贵族都来作证。吃饭时，他同孩子们坐在桌子末端，他们微笑着望着他，可那是怎样一种恩主的微笑啊。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This woman cannot despise me any longer: in  that case,' he said to himself, 'I ought to be stirred by her beauty; I owe it  to myself to be her lover.' Such an idea would never have occurred to him  before he received the artless confidences of his friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这女人再不能轻视我了，在这种情况下，”他心中暗想，“我应该对她的美貌有所感觉，我有义务成为她的情夫。”这样的念头，若是在他那朋友的天真的表白之前，他是不会有的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The sudden resolution he had just made  formed a pleasing distraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他刚刚突然间下定的决心使他感到轻松快活。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He said to himself: 'I must have one of  these two women'; he realized that he would greatly have preferred to pay his  court to Madame Derville; it was not that she was more attractive, but she had  seen him always as a tutor honoured for his learning, and not as a working  carpenter, with a ratteen jacket folded under his arm, as he had first appeared  to Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他对自己说：“我必须得到这两个女人中的一个。”他觉得追求德尔维夫人要好得多，这倒不是因为她更可爱，而是因为在她眼里，他始终是一个因有学问而受人尊重的家庭教师，而不是最初出现在德·莱纳夫人面前的那个胳膊下夹着一件平纹结子花呢上衣的木工。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It was precisely as a young workman,  blushing to the whites of his eyes, hesitating outside the door of the house  and not venturing to ring the bell, that Madame de Renal delighted most to  picture him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人偏偏总把他想成那个年轻的工人，羞得眼白都红了，站在门口不敢按铃，觉得那最有魅力。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As he followed up this survey of his  position, Julien saw that he must not think of attempting the conquest of  Madame Derville, who had probably noticed the weakness that Madame de Renal  showed for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连继续察看自己的处境，他看出他不应该考虑征服德尔维夫人，她大概觉察到德·莱纳夫人对他有意。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Forced to return to the latter: 'What do I  know of this woman's character?' Julien asked himself. 'Only this: before I  went away, I took her hand,she withdrew it; today I withdraw my hand, she  seizes it and presses it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他于是不能不回到德·莱纳夫人身上来。“我对这女人的性格知道些什么呢？”于连心想，“只是这一点：我出门之前，我握住她的手，她抽回了；今天，我，抽回我的手，她却抓住了，并且握紧。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A good opportunity to repay her all the  contempt she has shown for me.God knows how many lovers she has had! Perhaps  she is deciding in my favour only because of the facilities for our meeting.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>真是一个好机会，让我把她曾对我表示的轻蔑全都回报给她。天知道她有过多少情夫！她看中了我，也许仅仅是因为见面容易。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Such is, alas, the drawback of an excessive  civilisation. At the age of twenty, the heart of a young man, if he has any  education, is a thousand leagues from that devil-may-care attitude without  which love is often only the most tedious duty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>唉！这就是一种过度的文明造成的不幸！一个二十岁的年轻人，只要受过些教育，其心灵便与顺乎自然相距千里，而没有顺乎自然，爱情就常常不过是一种最令人厌烦的责任罢了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I owe it to myself all the more,' went on  Julien's petty vanity, 'to succeed with this woman, so that if I ever make my  fortune, and someone reproaches me with having filled the humble post of tutor,  I may let it be understood that it was love that brought me into that  position.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连那小小的虚荣心继续向前：“我尤其应该在这个女人身上取得成功，万一我发了迹，若有人指责我当过低贱的家庭教师，我可以说是爱情把我推向了这个位置。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien once more withdrew his hand from that  of Madame de Renal,then took her hand again and pressed it. As they returned to  the drawing-room, towards mid-night, Madame de Renal murmured in hisear:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连再次把手从德·菜纳夫人的手中抽出来，然后又抓住她的手，紧紧握住。将近午夜，回客厅的时候，德·莱纳夫人低声对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Are you leaving us, are you going away?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您要离开我们，您要走？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien answered with a sigh:'I must indeed  go away, for I love you passionately; it is a sin … and what a sin for a young  priest!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连叹了口气，答道：“我不得不走呀，因为我热烈地爱着您，这是一个错误……对一个年轻的教士来说，这是怎样一个错误啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal leaned upon his arm, bending  towards him until her cheek felt the warmth of his.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人靠在于连的胳膊上，那样地忘情，她的脸都感觉到了于连的脸的温热。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The night passed for these two people very  differently. Madame de Renal was exalted by transports of the most lofty moral  pleasure. A coquettish girl who falls in love early grows accustomed to the  distress of love; when she comes to the age of true passion, the charm of  novelty is lacking. As Madame de Renal had never read any novels, all the  refinements of her happiness were new to her. No melancholy truth came to  freeze her heart, not even the spectre of the future. She saw herself as happy  in ten years' time as she was at that moment. Even the thought of virtue and of  the fidelity she had vowed to M. de Renal, which had distressed her some days  before, presented itself in vain, she dismissed it like an importunate  stranger. 'Never will I allow Julien to take any liberty,' Madame de Renal told  herself, 'we shall live in future as we have been living for the last month. He  shall be a friend.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这两个人的后半夜完全不同。德·莱纳夫人兴奋，因最高尚的精神享受而激动不己。一个卖弄风情的少女早早地恋爱，会渐渐习惯于爱的烦恼。德·莱纳夫人从未读过小说，她的幸福的各种程度对她来说都是新鲜的。没有任何可悲的事实，甚至也没有未来的幽灵，来给她泼冷水。她看到自己十年后仍如此时此刻这般幸福。贞洁的观念，向德·莱纳先生发誓忠实的观念，几天前还让她心烦意乱，现在却徒有其表，像一个不速之客一样被打发走了。“我永远也不会答应于连什么的，”她对自己说，“我们将像一个月以来那样过下去。他将是一个朋友。”</p>
