<p>Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression, And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft, And burning blushes, though for no transgression.</p>
<p>Don Juan, I. 74</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>于是就有叹息，由于压抑而更深沉，就有偷偷的相视，因偷偷而更甜蜜，就像有火一般的羞红，虽然不是由于犯了什么罪。</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>The angelic sweetness which Madame de Renal derived from her own character  as well as from her present happiness was interrupted only when she happened to  think of her maid Elisa. This young woman received a legacy, went to make her  confession to the cure Chelan, and revealed to him her intention to marry  Julien. The cure was genuinely delighted at his friend's good fortune; but his  surprise was great when Julien informed him with a resolute air that Miss  Elisa's offer could not be accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·菜纳夫人天使般的温柔，既得之于性格，也得之于眼前的幸福，只是偶而想到女仆爱丽莎，态度才稍许有些改变。这姑娘继承了一份遗产，去向谢朗神甫作忏悔，说她打算和于连结婚。神甫为朋友的幸福感到由衷的高兴，但是他万万没有想到，于连竟断然拒绝，说爱丽莎小姐的提议对他不合适。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Pay good heed, my son, to what is taking place in your heart,' said  the cure, frowning; 'I congratulate you on your vocation, if it is to it alone that  must be ascribed your scorn of a more than adequate provision. For fifty-six  years and more have I been cure at Verrieres, and yet, so far as one can see, I  am going to be deprived. This distresses me, albeit I have an income of eight  hundred livres. I tell you of this detail in order that you may not be under  any illusion as to what is in store for you in the priestly calling. If you  think of paying court to the men in power, your eternal ruin is assured. You  may make your fortune, but you will have to injure the poor and needy, flatter  the Sub-Prefect, the Mayor, the important person, and minister to his passions:  such conduct, which in the world is called the art of life, may, in a layman,  be not wholly incompatible with salvation; but in our calling, we have to  choose; we must make our fortune either in this world or in the next, there is  no middle way.Go, my dear friend, reflect, and come back in three days' time  with a definite answer. I am sorry to see underlying your character, a  smouldering ardour which does not suggest to my mind the moderation and  complete <a href="#" title="

">renunciation</a> of earthly advantages necessary in a priest; I augur well  from your intelligence; but, allow me to tell you,' the good cure went on,with  tears in his eyes, 'in the calling of a priest, I shall tremble for your salvation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我的孩子，当心您在想些什么呀，”神甫皱着眉头说。“您若单单为了志向而蔑视一笔不俗的财富，我祝贺您。我当维里埃的本堂神甫已足足五十六年，然而种种迹象表明，我仍要被撤职，这使我很难过，但是我毕竟还有八百利弗尔的年金。我告诉您这一细节，为的是让您不要对当教士的前途抱有幻想。如果您想巴结权贵，那您必将堕入地狱，万劫不复。您可能发迹，那就得损害受苦的人，奉承专区区长、市长、有权有势的人，为其欲望效劳。这种行为在尘世间被称为处世之道，对一个世俗的人来说，这种处世之道和他的获救并非绝对地不相容。但是我们当教士的就要有所选择了。要么在尘世发财，要么在天国享福，没有中间道路。去吧，我亲爱的朋友，仔细想想，过三天给我最后的答复。我很难过，我在您的性格深处隐约看见郁结着一股热情，它向我表明的不是一个教士应具备的克制和对尘世利益的完全弃绝。我看透了您的心思。但是，请允许我对您说，”善良的神甫又补了一句，眼里含着泪，“您若当了教士，我担心您是否能获救。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien was ashamed of his emotion; for the first time in his life,  he saw himself loved; he wept for joy, and went to hide his tears in the great woods  above Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连大为感动，心中不免惭傀；他生平第一次看到有人爱他；他高兴得哭了，为了不让人看见，他跑到山上的大树林里哭了个痛快。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why am I in this state?' he asked himself at length; 'I feel that I  would give my life a hundred times over for that good Father Chelan, and yet he  has just proved to me that I am no better than a fool. It is he above all that  I have to deceive, and he sees through me. That secret ardour of which he  speaks is my plan for making my fortune. He thinks me unfit to be a priest, at  the very moment when I imagined that the sacrifice of an income of fifty louis  was going to give him the most exalted idea of my piety and my vocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么我会这样？”最后他对自己说，“我觉得我能为谢朗这位善良的神甫去死一百次，然而他却刚刚向我证明我不过是个傻瓜而已。要紧的是把他骗过，而他却猜中了我的心思。他说的我那一股郁结的热情，正是我的发迹的计划呀。他认为我不配当教士，又恰恰是在我以为放弃五十路易的年金会使他对我的虔诚和志向给予最高评价的时候。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'For the future,' Julien continued, 'I shall rely only upon those  elements of my character which I have tested. Who would ever have said that I should  find pleasure in shedding tears? That I should love the man who proves to me  that I am nothing more than a fool?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“将来，”于连又想，“我只能相信我的性格中经过考验的那部分了。谁会对我说，我能在眼泪中找到快乐！我爱这个证明我不过是个傻瓜的人！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Three days later, Julien had found the pretext with which he should have  armed himself from the first; this pretext was a calumny, but what of that? He  admitted to the cure, after much hesitation, that a reason which he could not  explain to him, because to reveal it would injure a third party, had dissuaded  him from the first from the projected  marriage. This was tantamount to an  indictment of Elisa's conduct. M.Chelan detected in his manner a fire that was  wholly mundane, and  very different from that which should have inspired a young Levite.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>三天以后，于连去见神甫。他已经找到托辞，其实他本该第一天就准备好的。这托辞乃是一种诽谤，不过这又有什么关系呢？他吞吞吐吐地向神甫承认，有一个不便言明的理由使他一开始就不能考虑这桩拟议中的婚事，说出来会损害一个第三者。这是谴责受丽莎行为不端啊。谢朗先生发现他的态度中有一种全然世俗的热情，与那种激励着一个年轻教士的热情迥然不同。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My friend,'  he appealed to him again, 'be an honest yeoman, educated and respected, rather  than a priest without a vocation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的朋友，”神甫对他说，“与其当一个没有信仰的教士，还是作一位受人尊敬的、有教养的乡绅吧。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien replied to these fresh remonstrances extremely well, so far  as words went; he hit upon the expressions which a fervent young seminarist  would have employed; but the tone in which he uttered them, the ill-concealed fire  that smouldered in his eyes alarmed M. Chelan.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>就言辞论，于连对这些新的告诫回答得很好，他找到了一个热忱的年轻神学院学生能够用的那些词儿。然而他的口气，还有那掩藏不住的，在他的眼睛里闪烁的热情，却使谢朗神甫深感不安。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>We need not augur ill for Julien's future; he hit upon the correct  form of words of a cunning and prudent hypocrisy. That is not bad at his age.As  for his tone and gestures, he lived among country folk; he had been debarred  from seeing the great models. In the sequel, no sooner had he been permitted to  mix with these gentlemen than he became admirable as well in gesture as in  speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对于连的前途倒也不可小看，他能就一种圆滑谨慎的伪善编造出一套得体的话来，这在他这个年纪已很不错。至于声口和做派只好不论，因为他一向只和乡下佬在一起，不曾见过大人物。日后只要他有机会接近那些先生们，他的谈吐和举止都会很快爱人赞赏的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal was surprised that her maid's newly acquired for tune  had not made the girl more happy; she saw her going incessantly to the cure's,  and returning with tears in her eyes; finally Elisa spoke to her mistress of  her marriage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人很纳闷儿，女仆新近得了一笔财产，却没有变得更快活，她见她不断地去本堂神甫那儿，回来时眼里总噙着泪。爱丽莎终于跟她谈起自己的婚姻大事。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Madame de Renal believed herself to have fallen ill; a sort of fever  prevented her enjoying any sleep; she was alive only when she had her maid or  Julien before her eyes. She could think of nothing but them and the happiness  they would find in their married life. The poverty of the small house in which  people would be obliged to live, with an income of fifty louis, portrayed  itself to her in enchanting colours. Julien might very well become a lawyer at  Bray, the Sub-Prefecture two leagues from Verrieres; in that event she would  see something of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人相信自己是病了，浑身发热，夜不能眠，只在眼皮底下有女仆或于连的时候，才觉得自己是活着。她脑子里尽是他俩和他们家庭生活的幸福。这个小小的家庭只能靠五十路易的年金过活，然而其清贫却在她的面前呈现出迷人的色彩。于连很可以在距维里埃两法里的专区首府博莱当一名律师，这样她还能偶而见上他一面。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal sincerely believed that she was going mad; she said so  to her husband, and finally did fall ill. That evening, as her maid was waiting  upon her, she noticed that the girl was crying. She loathed Elisa at that  moment, and had spoken sharply to her; she begged the girl's pardon. Elisa's tears  increased; she said that if her mistress would allow it,she would tell her the  whole tale of her distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人真地以为她就要发疯了，她告诉了丈夫，终于病倒，当天晚上，女仆侍候她，她发现这姑娘在哭。她这时厌恶爱丽莎，刚刚还粗暴地对待过她，可是又请求她原谅。爱丽莎哭得更凶了，她说如果女主人允许，她将把她的不幸全都倾吐出来。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Speak,' replied Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“说吧，”德·莱纳夫人答道。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well, the fact is, Ma'am, he won't have me; wicked people must have  spoken evil of me to him, and he believes them.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“唉，夫人，他拒绝我。肯定有坏人说了我的坏话，他相信了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who won't have you?' said Madame de Renal, scarcely able to breathe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁拒绝您？”德·莱纳夫人喘不过气来了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  who could it be, Ma'am, but M. Julien?' the maid replied through her sobs. 'His  Reverence has failed to overcome his resistance; for His Reverence considers  that he ought not to refuse a decent girl, just because she has been a lady's  maid. After all, M. Julien's own father is no better than a carpenter; and he  himself, how was he earning his living before he came to Madame's?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“夫人，除了于连先生还有谁呢？”女仆说着呜咽起来，“神甫先生也没能说动他，神甫先生认为他不应该拒绝一个好姑娘，就因为她是个女仆。说到底，于连先生的父亲也不过是个木匠罢了，他自己来夫人家之前又是怎样谋生来着？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal had ceased to listen; <a href="#" title="

">surfeit</a> of happiness had  almost deprived her of the use of her reason. She made the girl repeat to her several  times the assurance that Julien had refused in a positive manner,which would  not permit of his coming to a more reasonable decision later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·莱纳夫人不再听女仆说了，她大喜过望，几乎丧失了理智。她让女仆反复表明她确信于连已断然拒绝，不可能再回到—个更为明智的决定上去。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I wish to make a final effort,' she said to her maid. 'I shall  speak to M. Julien.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我想最后再试一次，”她对女仆说，“我去跟于连先生谈谈……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next day after luncheon, Madame de Renal gave herself the  exquisite sensation of pleading her rival's cause, and of seeing Elisa's hand  and fortune persistently refused for an hour on end.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天午饭以后，整整一个钟头德·莱纳夫人一边为她的情敌说好话，一边又看到其婚事和财产不断地遭到拒绝，这其间的乐趣真是妙不可言啊。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Little by little Julien abandoned his attitude of studied reserve,  and ended by making spirited answers to the sound arguments advanced by Madame  de Renal. She could not hold out against the torrent of happiness which now  poured into her heart after all those days of despair. She found herself really  ill. When she had come to herself, and was comfortably settled in her own room,  she asked to be left alone. She was in a state of profound astonishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>渐渐地，于连放弃了他那些刻板的回答，对德·莱纳夫人的明智的劝告应对自如，饶有风趣。她度过了多少个绝望的日子啊，终于抵挡不住这股幸福的激流，她的灵魂被淹没了。她的头真地晕了。当她清醒过来，在卧室里坐定之后，就让左右的人一一退下。她深感惊异。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Can I be in love with Julien?' she asked herself at length.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“莫非我对于连动了情？”最后，她心中暗想。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This discovery, which at any other time would have filled her with  remorse and with a profound agitation, was no more to her than a singular spectacle,  but one that left her indifferent. Her heart, exhausted by all that she had  just undergone, had no sensibility left to place at the service of her  passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一发现，若换个时候，必使她悔恨交加，坐卧不宁，而此刻不过成了似乎与己无关的一幕奇景。她的心力已被刚刚经历的这一切耗尽，再无感受力供激情驱遣了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal tried to work, and fell into a deep sleep; when she awoke,  she was less alarmed than she should have been. She was too happy to be able to  take anything amiss. Artless and innocent as she was,this honest provincial had  never tormented her soul in an attempt to wring from it some little sensibility  to some novel shade of sentiment or distress. Entirely absorbed, before Julien  came, in that mass of work which, outside Paris, is the lot of a good wife and  mother, Madame de Renal thought about the passions, as we think about the  lottery: a certain disappointment and a happiness sought by fools alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·菜纳夫人想做活儿，不料竟沉沉睡去；醒来后，她本应十分害怕，然而却不曾。她是太幸福了，什么事情都不往坏处看。这个善良的外省女人天真无邪，从未折磨过自己的灵魂，令其稍许感受一下感情或痛苦的新变化。于连到来之前，德·莱纳夫人的心思完全被一大堆家务占住，对于一个远离巴黎的好家庭主妇来说，这也就是她的命运了，因此她想到激情就如同我们想到彩票一祥，不过是确定无疑的骗局和疯子们追逐的幸运罢了。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The dinner bell rang; Madame de Renal blushed deeply when she heard  Julien's voice as he brought in the children. Having acquired some adroitness  since she had fallen in love, she accounted for her colour by complaining of a  splitting headache.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>晚饭的铃声响了，于连已带着孩子们回来，德·莱纳夫人听见他的说话声，脸刷地红了。自打她恋爱以来，人也变得机灵些了，她为了解释脸红，就推说头疼得厉害。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There you have women,' put in M. de Renal, with a coarse  laugh.'There's always something out of order in their machinery.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“看看，女人都是这个样子，”德·莱纳先生哈哈大笑，回答说，“这架机器总有点毛病要修理！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Accustomed as she was to this form of wit, the tone of his voice  hurt Madame de Renal. She sought relief in studying Julien's features; had he been  the ugliest man in the world, he would have charmed her at that moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·莱纳夫人尽管已习惯了这样的俏皮话，但是那口气仍使她感到不快。为了分分神，她端详起于连的相貌；他即便是世上最丑的男人，此刻也会讨得她的喜欢。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Always zealous in imitating the habits of the Court, with the first  fine days of spring M. de Renal removed his household to Vergy; it is the  village rendered famous by the tragic adventure of Gabrielle. A few hundred  yards from the picturesque ruins of the old gothic church, M.de Renal owned an  old castle with its four towers, and a garden laid out like that of the  Tuileries, with a number of box borders, and chestnut alleys trimmed twice in  the year. An adjoining field, planted with apple trees, allowed the family to  take the air. Nine or ten splendid walnuts grew at the end of the orchard;  their massive foliage rose to a height of some eighty feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳先生很注意模仿宫廷人士的习惯，春天的晴好日子一到，就举家住进韦尔吉，这个村子因加布里埃尔的悲惨遭遇而出了名。村里曾有一哥特式教堂，现已成为废墟，颇堪入画，约百步外，德·莱纳先生拥有一座四个塔楼的古堡和一个花园，其布局很象杜伊勒里花园，有茂密的黄杨树墙，小径两侧是每年修剪两次的果树。毗邻的一片地上栽有苹果树，充作散步的场所。果园尽头有八棵到十棵雄伟的胡桃树，枝叶扶疏如巨盖，可能高达八、九十尺。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Each of those damned walnuts,' M. de Renal would say when his wife admired  them, 'costs me half an acre of crop; the corn will not grow in their shade.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>每当妻子赞美这些胡桃树的时候，德·莱纳先生就说：“这些该死的胡桃树，每一株都毁了我半阿尔邦地的收成，树荫下种不了麦子。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The rustic scene appeared to come as a novelty to Madame de  Renal;her admiration knew no bounds. The feeling that animated her gave her a  new spirit and determination. On the second day after their removal to Vergy,  M. de Renal having returned to town upon some official business,his wife  engaged labourers at her own expense. Julien had given her the idea of a little  gravelled path, which should run round the orchard and beneath the big walnuts,  and would allow the children to walk there in the early morning without wetting  their shoes in the dew. This plan was put into execution within twenty-four  hours of its conception. Madame de Renal spent a long and happy day with Julieu  supervising the labourers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在德·莱纳夫人的眼中，这里的山川草木焕然一新，她不住地赞叹，简直陶醉了。她的胸中涌动着那种感情，人也变得聪明而果断。来到韦尔吉的第三天，德·莱纳先生返城处理市政府的公务，德·菜纳夫人就自己出钱雇了些工人。原来是于连给她出主意，在果园里和那些大胡桃树下修一条小路，铺上沙子，这样，孩子们大清早出去散步，鞋子就不会被露水打湿了。这个主意一提出，二十四小时内便被付诸实施。德·莱纳夫人一整天和于连一起指挥那些工人，很是快活。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When the Mayor of Verrieres returned from the town, he was greatly surprised  to find the path finished. His coming surprised Madame de Renal also; she had  forgotten that he existed. For the next two months, he continued to speak with  annoyance of their presumption in having carried out, without consulting him,  so important a repair, but Madame de Renal had done it at her own expense, and  this to some extent consoled him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>维里埃的市长从城里回来，看到一条新修的小路，十分惊讶。德·莱纳夫人看见他也感到惊讶，她早已把他抛在脑后了。一连两个月，他都气愤地谈到她的大胆妄为，居然不跟他商量就进行如此重大的维修工程。不过，德·莱纳夫人花的是自己的钱，这使他稍稍得到点安慰。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She spent her days running about the orchard with her children, and chasing  butterflies. They had made a number of large nets of light-coloured gauze, with  which they caught the unfortunate lepidoptera. This was the outlandish name  which Julien taught Madame de Renal. For she had sent to Besancon for the  handsome work on the subject by M.Godart; and Julien read to her the strange  habits of these insects.They fastened them, without compunction, with pins upon  a large sheet of pasteboard, also prepared by Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>德·莱纳夫人天天和孩子们在果园里奔跑，扑蝴蝶。他们用浅色的薄纱做了几个大网，用来捕捉可怜的鳞翅目昆虫。这个野蛮的名称是于连教给她的。因为她让人从贝藏松买来戈达尔孔生的那部精采的著作，于连就把这些可怜的昆虫的奇特习性讲给她听。它们被无情地用大头针钉在有框的大块硬纸板上，这硬纸板也是于连做的。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At last Madame de Renal and Julien had a subject for conversation;  he was no longer exposed to the frightful torture inflicted on him by intervals  of silence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人和于连之间总算有了一个话题，他可以不再忍受沉默的时刻带给他的那种可怕的折磨了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>They conversed incessantly, and with extreme interest, although  always of the most innocent things. This life, active, occupied and  cheerful,suited everyone, except Miss Elisa, who found herself worked to  death.'Even at carnival-time,' she said, 'when there is a ball at Verrieres,  Madame has never taken so much trouble over her dress; she changes her clothes  two or three times a day.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们说个不停，而且兴趣极浓，虽则所谈都是些无谓的事情。这种活跃、忙碌而愉快的生活，正合大家的口味，除了爱丽莎小姐，她觉得有干不完的活儿。她说：“就是在过狂欢节的时候，在维里埃的舞会上，夫人也没有这样用心打扮，她现在每天总要换两、三次衣裳。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As it is our intention to flatter no one, we shall not conceal the  fact that Madame de Renal, who had a superb skin, had dresses made for her which  exposed her arms and bosom freely. She was very well made, and this way of  dressing suited her to perfection.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>我们无意奉承谁，但我们得承认德·菜纳夫人的皮肤极好，她让人做的连衣裙胳膊和胸脯都很暴露。她有一副好腰身，这样的穿着再合适不过。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'You have never been so young, Ma'am,' her friends from Verrieres  used to tell her when they came to dine at Vergy. (It is a local form of  speech.) </p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>维里埃的朋友们来韦尔吉吃饭，都说：“您从来没有这么年轻过，夫人。”（这是当地人的一种说法。）</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A curious point, which our readers will scarcely believe, was that  Madame de Renal had no deliberate intention in taking such pains with her appearance.  She enjoyed doing so; and, without giving the matter any particular thought,  whenever she was not chasing butterflies with the children and Julien, she was  engaged with Elisa making dresses. Her one expedition to Verrieres was due to a  desire to purchase new summer clothes which had just arrived there from  Mulhouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一件奇怪的事情，说来我们都不大相信，德·莱纳夫人这样用心打扮竟是出于无意。她只是觉得快乐，并无别的想法，她除了和孩子及于连一起捉蝴蝶外，剩下的时间都用来跟爱丽莎一起做连衣裙。她只去过维里埃一趟，那是想买刚从米鲁兹运来的新式夏裙。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She brought back with her to Vergy a young woman, one of her  cousins. Since her marriage, Madame de Renal had gradually formed an intimate  friendship with Madame Derville, who in their younger days had been her school-fellow  at the Sacre-Coeur.</p>

<p>她回韦尔市的时候，带来一位少妇，她的亲戚。结婚以后，德·莱纳夫人不知不觉地与德尔维夫人走动得勤了，她们原来在圣心修道院是同伴。</p>

<p>Madame Derville laughed heartily at what she called her cousin's absurd ideas.  'If I were alone, they would never occur to me,' she used to say. These sudden  ideas, which in Paris would have been called sallies,made Madame de Renal feel  ashamed, as of something foolish, when she was with her husband; but Madame  Derville's presence gave her courage. She began by telling her what she was  thinking in a timid voice;when the ladies were by themselves for any length of  time, Madame de Renal would become animated, and a long, undisturbed morning  passed in a flash and left the friends quite merry. On this visit, the sensible  Madame Derville found her cousin much less merry and much happier.</p>

<p>德尔维夫人听到表妹的那些她所谓的疯念头，常常大笑，说：“我一个人怎么也想不出。”这些谁也料不到的念头在巴黎是可以被称为隽语警句的，若是跟丈夫在一起，德·莱纳夫人会感到羞耻，仿佛说了句蠢话，然而德尔维产人的在场给了她勇气。她先是怯怯地谈出她的想法，后来两位夫人长时间独处，德·莱纳夫人的精神便兴奋起来，一个长长的寂寞的早晨转眼间就过去，两个朋友感到非常快乐。在这次旅行中，理智的德尔维夫人发现表妹远不如过去快活，但远比过去幸福。</p>

<p>Julien, meanwhile, had been living the life of a child since he had  come to the country, as happy to be running after butterflies as were his  pupils. After so much constraint and skilful diplomacy, alone, unobserved by  his fellowmen, and, instinctively, feeling not in the least afraid of Madame de  Renal, he gave himself up to the pleasure of being alive, so keen at his age,  and in the midst of the fairest mountains in the world.</p>

<p>至于于连，自打到了乡下，真地变成了一个孩子，跟他的学生们一样兴高采烈地追捕蝴蝶。从前他得处处克制，事事要手腕，如今他独来独往，远离男人们的目光，又本能地不惧怕德·莱纳夫人，因此能尽情享受生活的快乐，何况这快乐在他那个年纪是如此地强烈，又是在世界上最美丽的群山之中。</p>

<p>As soon as Madame Derville arrived, Julien felt that she was his friend;  he hastened to show her the view that was to be seen from the end of the new  path; as a matter of fact it was equal, if not superior to the most admirable  scenery which Switzerland and the Italian lakes have to offer. By climbing the  steep slope which began a few yards farther on,one came presently to high precipices  fringed with oakwoods, which projected almost over the bed of the river. It was  to the summits of these sheer rocks that Julien, happy, free, and indeed  something more, lord of the house, led the two friends, and relished  their admiration of those sublime prospects.</p>

<p>德尔维夫人一到，于连就觉得她是自己的朋友，于是急忙领她—去胡桃树下那条新修小路的尽头看风景。事实上，那景致不说胜过瑞士和意大利湖泊中最令人赞叹的美景，至少也是不相上下。如果再走出几步，沿着陡急的山坡，很快便可登上橡树林环抱着的悬崖峭壁。这悬崖峭壁几乎一直伸到河上。于连幸福，自由，俨然一家之主，常带两位女友登上斧劈般高耸的绝顶，她们对这壮丽的风光的赞叹使他心花怒放。</p>

<p>'To me it is like Mozart's music,' said Madame Derville.</p>

<p>“对我来说，这就是莫扎特的音乐呀，”德尔维夫人说。</p>

<div class="left"><p>His  brothers' jealousy, the presence of a despotic and ill-tempered father had  spoiled the country round Verrieres in Julien's eyes. At Vergy,he found no  trace of these unpleasant memories; for the first time in his life, he could  see no one that was his enemy. When M. de Renal was in town, as frequently  happened, he ventured to read; soon, instead of reading at night, and then  taking care, moreover, to shade his lamp with an inverted flowerpot, he could  take his full measure of sleep; during the day, in the interval between the  children's lessons, he climbed up among these rocks with the book that was his  sole rule of conduct, and the sole object of his transports. He found in it at  once happiness, ecstasy and consolation in moments of depression.</p>

<p>在于连看来，哥哥们的嫉妒、专横而脾气暴躁的父亲的存在，破坏了维里埃周围乡村的风光。在韦尔吉，他看不到什么可以勾起这些苦涩的回忆的东西，他有生以来第一次看不到敌人。德·莱纳先生常常在城里，他便放胆读书，很快他也能尽兴睡觉了，从前要读书就得在夜里，还要把灯藏在一只倒置的花瓶里。现在，白日里在孩子们做功课的间歇中，他带着那本书来到悬崖上，那可是他唯一的行为准则和陶醉的对象啊。他在那里面同时找到了幸福、狂喜和气馁时刻的慰籍。</p>

<p>Certain things which Napoleon says of women, various discussions of the  merits of the novels in vogue during his reign, furnished him now,for the first  time, with several ideas which would long since have been familiar to any other  young man of his age.</p>

<p>拿破仑说到女人的某些话，他对其治下流行小说价值的一些议论，使于连开始有了一些思想，而这些思想，和他同龄的年轻人可能早就有了。</p>

<p>The hot weather came. They formed the habit of spending the evening under  a huge lime a few yards from the house. There the darkness was intense. One  evening, Julien was talking with emphasis, he was <a href="#" title="

<p>大热天来了。房子几步外有一株大椴树，到了晚上，大家就坐在树下。那里光线很暗。一天晚上，于连对着年轻女人侃侃而谈，心里美滋滋地。他说得兴起，指手划脚间，碰到了德·莱纳夫人的手，那只手正搁在平时置于院中的一把漆过的椅子的背上。</p>
</div></div>

<p>The hand was hurriedly withdrawn; but Julien decided that it was his  duty to secure that the hand should not be withdrawn when he touched it. The  idea of a duty to be performed, and of making himself ridiculous,or rather  being left with a sense of inferiority if he did not succeed in performing it,  at once took all the pleasure from his heart.</p>

<p>这只手很快抽了回去，然而于连想，要让这只手在他碰到时不抽回去，这乃是他的责任。想到有一种责任要履行，想到若做不到就会成为笑柄或招致一种自卑感，他心中的快乐顿时烟消云散。 </p></div></div>
