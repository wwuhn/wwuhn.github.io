  <div class="left"><p>The  first thing that Julien did on arriving in Verrieres was to reproach himself  for his unfairness to Madame de Renal. 'I should have despised her as a foolish  woman if from weakness she had failed to bring off the scene with M. de Renal!  She carried it through like a diplomat, and my sympathies are with the loser,  who is my enemy. There is a streak of middle-class pettiness in my nature; my  vanity is hurt, because M. de Renal is a man! That vast and illustrious  corporation to which I have the honour to belong; I am a perfect fool.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一到维里埃，于连就责备自己错怪了德·莱纳夫人。“假使她由于软弱而把她与德·莱纳先生的那场戏演砸了，我就会把她当作一个柔弱女子而蔑视她！可她应付裕如，像个外交家，而我却对那个失败者产生了同情，他原本是我的敌人啊。在我的行为中有一种市民的狭隘，我的虚荣心受到伤害，因为德·莱纳先生毕竞是个男子汉！我有幸和他同属这杰出而宏大的群体；其实我不过是个傻瓜而已。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="left">

<p>M.  Chelan had refused the offers of hospitality which the most respected Liberals  of the place had vied with one another in making him, when his deprivation  drove him from the presbytery. The pair of rooms which he had taken were  littered with his books. Julien, wishing to show Verrieres what it meant to be  a priest, went and fetched from his father's store a dozen planks of firwood,  which he carried on his back the whole length of the main street. He borrowed  some tools from an old friend and had soon constructed a sort of bookcase in  which he arranged M. Chelan's library.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>谢朗先生已遭解职，被逐出本堂神甫住宅。当地最有声望的自由党人竞相为他提供住处，然而他拒绝了。他自己租了两间房，里面堆满了书。于连想让维里埃人看看教士是何等样人，就去他父亲那里取了十二块纵木板，亲自扛着，走过整条大街。他从一个旧时的伙伴那里借来工具，很快粗粗做了个书橱，把谢朗先生的书排放整齐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  supposed you to have been corrupted by the vanity of the world,' said the old  man, shedding tears of joy; 'this quite redeems the childishness of that  dazzling guard of honour uniform which made you so many enemies.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我还以为您已被尘世的虚荣腐蚀了呢，”老人对他说，高兴得流下眼泪，“这足以抵过您当仪仗队员穿漂亮制服的孩子气，那曾使您树敌甚多。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal had told Julien to put up in his house. No one had any suspicion of  what had happened. On the third day after his arrival, there came up to his  room no less a personage than the Sub-Prefect, M. de Maugiron. It was only  after two solid hours of insipid tittle-tattle, and long jeremiads on the  wickedness of men, on the lack of honesty in the people entrusted with the  administration of public funds, on the dangers besetting poor France, etc.,  etc., that Julien saw him come at length to the purpose of his visit. They were  already on the landing, and the poor tutor, on the verge of disgrace, was  ushering out with all due respect the future Prefect of some fortunate  Department, when it pleased the latter gentleman to occupy himself with  Julien's career, to praise his moderation where his own interests were  concerned, etc., etc. Finally M. de Maugiron, taking him in his arms in the  most fatherly manner, suggested to him that he should leave M. de Renal and  enter the household of an official who had children to educate, and who, like  King Philip, would thank heaven, not so much for having given him them as for  having caused them to be born in the neighbourhood of M. Julien. Their tutor  would receive a salary of eight hundred francs, payable not month by month,  'which is not noble,' said M. de Maugiron, but quarterly, and in advance to  boot.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生命令于连住在他家里。没有人觉察发生了什么事。于连到后第三天，他看见专区区长德·莫吉隆先生这位并非无足轻重的人物上了楼，一直来到他的房间。听他说了两个钟头的废话，还有深沉的慨叹，诸如人之凶恶啊，公款管理人员之不正啊，可怜的法兰西之种种危险啊，等等，等等，于连方才看出来访的目的。可怜的半失宠的家庭教师彬彬有礼地送这位某个幸运省份的未来省长，他们走到了楼梯口时，来客突然心血来潮，关心起于连的前程，称赞起他对个人利益的谦逊态度，等等，等等。终于，德·莫吉隆先生在慈父般地拥抱他的时候，建议他离开德·莱纳先生，到另一位有孩子需要教育的官员家里去，而这位官员将加菲利普国王那样感谢上天，不是感谢上天让他有了这些孩子，而是感谢它让他们生活在于连先生身边。他们的教师可以有八百法郎收入，“不是按月支付，那样不气派，”德·莫吉隆先生说，“而是按季支付，并且提前支付。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was now the turn of Julien who, for an hour and a half, had been waiting  impatiently for an opportunity to speak. His reply was perfect, and as long as  a pastoral charge; it let everything be understood, and at the same time said  nothing definite. A listener would have found in it at once respect for M. de  Renal, veneration for the people of Verrieres and gratitude towards the illustrious  Sub-Prefect. The said Sub-Prefect, astonished at finding a bigger Jesuit than  himself, tried in vain to obtain something positive. Julien, overjoyed, seized  the opportunity to try his skill and began his answer over again in different  terms. Never did the most eloquent Minister, seeking to monopolise the last  hours of a sitting when the Chamber seems inclined to wake up, say less in more  words.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>现在轮到于连说话了，一个半钟头以来他一直不耐烦地等着说话的机会。他的回答无懈可击，但尤其是长，长得像主教训谕；听起来什么都有，可又什么都不说清楚。既有对德·莱纳先生的尊重，又有对维里埃公众的崇敬，又有对大名鼎鼎的专区区长的感激。这位专区区长发现于连比他还虚伪，不免大为惊讶，他竭力想得到什么确切的东西，却终属徒劳。于连非常高兴，抓住机会练习，又把他的回答用另—套词句来了一遍。一位善辩的大臣想利用会议结束使议会从昏睡中醒过来，怕也不会用这样多纳话说出这样少的东西。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  soon as M. de Maugiron had left him, Julien broke out in helpless laughter. To  make the most of his Jesuitical bent, he wrote a letter of nine pages to M. de  Renal, in which he informed him of everything that had been said to him, and  humbly asked his advice. 'Why, that rascal never even told me the name of the  person who is making the offer! It will be M. Valenod, who sees in my  banishment to Verrieres the effect of his anonymous letter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莫吉隆先生一出门，于连就像疯子一样哈哈大笑起米。于连趁着这股虚伪劲儿，写了一封长达九页的信给德·莱纳先生，向他报告刚才人家跟他说的一切，并谦卑地请求指教。“这混蛋还没有告诉我请我教书的人的姓名！肯定是瓦勒诺先生，他已经从我在维里埃的流放中看出他的匿名信的效果了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  missive dispatched, Julien, as happy as a hunter who at six in the morning on a  fine autumn day emerges upon a plain teeming with game, went out to seek the  advice of M. Chelan. But before he arrived at the good cure's house, heaven,  which was anxious to shower its blessings on him, threw him into the arms of M.  Valenod, from whom he did not conceal the fact that his heart was torn; a  penniless youth like himself was bound to devote himself entirely to the  vocation which heaven had placed in his heart, but a vocation was not  everything in this vile world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这封快信发出后，于连快活得像在美丽的秋日早晨六点就冲向猎物丰富的原野的猎人一样，出门找谢朗先生求教去了。他正走在去善良的神甫家的路上，上天还想让他快活一回，又把瓦勒诺先生扔在他的脚下。他毫不隐瞒他的心已破碎。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>To  be a worthy labourer in the Lord's vineyard, and not to be altogether unworthy  of all one's learned fellow-labourers, one required education; one required to  spend in the seminary at Besancon two very expensive years; it became  indispensable, therefore, to save money, which was considerably easier with a  salary of eight hundred francs paid quarterly, than with six hundred francs  which melted away month by month. On the other hand, did not heaven, by placing  him with the Renal boys, and above all by inspiring in him a particular  attachment to them, seem to indicate to him that it would be a mistake to  abandon this form of education for another? …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一个像他那样的穷孩子理应全身心地服从上天置于他心中的志向，然而在这人世间志向并非一切。为了无愧于在天主的葡萄园里劳作，和那几个博学的同行共事而不至于完全不配，他必须受教育，必须花钱在贝藏松的神学院住上两年，因此他不能不攒些钱，靠按季支付的八百法郎年薪当然要比按月支付的六百法郎年薪容易得多。不过，从另一方面说，上天已把他安排在莱纳家的孩子们身边，尤其是上天已使他对他们产生了一种特殊的感情，这不是向他表明放弃这一教育工作而去接受另一教育工作是不适宜的吗？……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  arrived at such a pitch of perfection in this kind of eloquence, which has  taken the place of the swiftness of action of the Empire, that he ended by  growing tired of the sound of his own voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>帝国时代的迅速行动已被词令取代，在此类雄辩中，于连已达到完美的程度，说着说着，那声音连他自已都厌烦了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Returning  to the house he found one of M. Valenod's servants in full livery, who had been  looking for him all over the town, with a note inviting him to dinner that very  day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>回家的时候，于连看见瓦勒诺先生家的仆人，身穿华丽的号衣，正拿着当日午餐的请帖，跑遍全城到处找他呢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Never  had Julien set foot in the man's house; only a few days earlier, his chief  thought was how he might give him a thorough good thrashing without subsequent  action by the police. Although dinner was not to be until one o'clock, Julien  thought it more respectful to present himself at half past twelve in the study  of the Governor of the Poorhouse. He found him displaying his importance amid a  mass of papers. His huge black whiskers, his enormous quantity of hair, his  nightcap poised askew on the top of his head, his immense pipe, his embroidered  slippers, the heavy gold chains slung across his chest in every direction, and  all the equipment of a provincial financier, who imagines himself to be a  ladies' man, made not the slightest impression upon Julien; he only thought all  the more of the thrashing that he owed him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>此人家里于连从未去过；仅仅几天前他还想如何能用棍子狠狠揍他一顿而不被拖上轻罪法庭。午餐定在一点钟，可于连觉得十二点半到收  容所所长先生的办公室更为恭敬些。他看见他神气十足，周围一大堆文件夹。他那又黑又粗的颊髭，浓密的头发，斜扣在头顶的希腊式便帽，巨大的烟斗，绣花拖鞋，纵横交又在胸前的金链，以及一位外省金融家用来表示自己正财运亨通的一整套装饰，并没有震住于连，他反而更想该揍他几棍子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  craved the honour of being presented to Madame Valenod; she was making her  toilet and could not see him. To make up for this, he had the privilege of  witnessing that of the Governor of the Poorhouse. They then proceeded to join  Madame Valenod, who presented her children to him with tears in her eyes. This  woman, one of the most important people in Verrieres, had a huge masculine  face, which she had plastered with rouge for this great ceremony. She displayed  all the pathos of maternal feelings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连求见瓦勒诺太太，她正在打扮，不能接待。作为补偿，他可以看看收容所所长如何打扮。然后他们去见瓦勒诺太太，她含着泪把孩子们介绍给于连。这位太太是维里埃最受敬重的太太之一，有着一张男人的大脸盘，为了这次隆重的午宴，她搽了胭脂。她把母爱尽量展示在这张脸上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  thought of Madame de Renal. His distrustful nature made him scarcely  susceptible to any memories save those that are evoked by contrast, but such  memories moved him to tears. This tendency was increased by the sight of the  Governor's house. He was taken through it.Everything  in it was sumptuous and new, and he was told the price of each article. But  Julien felt that there was something mean about it, a taint of stolen money.  Everyone, even the servants, wore a bold air that seemed to be fortifying them  against contempt</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连想到了德·莱纳夫人。他的多疑几乎使他只能接受此种由对比激起的回忆，于是，他感动得心中涌起一股柔情。收容所所长的房子的外观更加强了他的这种心情。他们带他参观房子。一切都是华丽的，崭新的，家具的价格都一一报给他听。然而于连只觉得有某种丑恶的东西，散发出偷来的钱的气味。包括仆人在内，这房子里的人都像是严阵以待，准备迎击轻蔑。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  collector of taxes, the receiver of customs, the chief constable and two or  three other public officials arrived with their wives. They were followed by  several wealthy Liberals. Dinner was announced. Julien, already in the worst of  humours, suddenly reflected that on the other side of the dining-room wall  there were wretched prisoners, whose rations of meat had perhaps been squeezed  to purchase all this tasteless splendour with which his hosts sought to dazzle  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>税务官，间接税征收人，宪兵长官和两三位公职人员偕同妻子来到。跟着又来了几位有钱的自由党人。仆人通报入席，于连早已很不痛快，这时想到餐厅隔壁就是那些可怜的被收容者；这种种向他炫耀的俗不可耐的奢华，那钱说不定就是利用职务之便从配给他们的肉食上揩下来的油。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'They  are hungry perhaps at this moment,' he said to himself; his throat contracted,  he found it impossible to eat and almost to speak. It was much worse a quarter  of an hour later; they could hear in the distance a few snatches of a popular  and, it must be admitted, not too refined song which one of the inmates was  singing. M. Valenod glanced at one of his men in full livery, who left the  room, and presently the sound of singing ceased. At that moment, a footman  offered Julien some Rhine wine in a green glass, and Madame Valenod took care  to inform him that this wine cost nine francs the bottle, direct from the  grower. Julien, the green glass in his hand, said to M. Valenod:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“现在也许他们正挨饿呢，”他心想；他嗓子眼儿一阵阵发紧，吃不下东西，几乎连话也不能说。一刻钟以后就更糟了，远处传来断断续续的歌声，那是一首民歌，应该承认，还有点儿下流，是一个被收容者唱的。瓦勒诺先生朝一个穿着号衣的仆人看了一眼，仆人走开了，很快人们就听不见歌声了。这时，一个仆人递给于连一杯莱茵葡萄酒，杯子是绿色的，瓦勒诺太太特意提醒于连这酒在产地每瓶就值九法郎。于连拿着这酒杯，对瓦勒诺先生说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  don't hear that horrid song any more.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他们不再唱这首下流的歌曲了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Gad!  I should think not, indeed,' replied the Governor triumphantly.'I've  made the rascal shut up.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“当然，我相信他们不再唱了，”所长答道，很得意，“我已命令这些叫花子不要出声。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was too much for Julien; he had acquired the manners but had not yet the heart  appropriate to his station. Despite all his hypocrisy, which he kept in such  constant practice, he felt a large tear trickle down his cheek.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这话于连听起来是太过份了；他的举止能符合他的身份，可是心还不能。他尽量经常施展他的伪善，还是觉得有一大滴眼泪顺着脸颊流下  。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  tried to hide it with the green glass, but it was simply impossible for him to  do honour to the Rhine wine. 'Stop the man singing!' he murmured to himself, 'O  my God, and Thou permittest it!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他试图用绿酒杯挡住，但他无论如何也不能赞赏这莱茵葡萄酒了。“不让唱歌！”他对自己说，“我的天主！你竟容忍了！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fortunately  for him, no one noticed his ill-bred emotion. The collector of taxes had struck  up a royalist ditty. During the clamour of the refrain,sung in chorus: 'There,'  Julien's conscience warned him, 'you have the sordid fortune which you will  achieve, and you will enjoy it only in these conditions and in such company as  this! You will have a place worth perhaps twenty thousand francs, but it must  be that while you gorge to repletion you stop the poor prisoner from singing;  you will give dinner parties with the money you have filched from his miserable  pittance, and during your dinner he will be more wretched still! O Napoleon!  How pleasant it was in your time to climb to fortune through the dangers of a  battle; but meanly to intensify the sufferings of the wretched!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>幸亏没有人发觉他这不合时宜的温情。税务官哼了一首保王党的歌曲。大家合唱叠句时，于连的良心突然说：“原来这就是你将获得的肮  脏财富啊，而你只能在这种场合跟这样的人一起享用！你可能会有一个两万法郎的职位，然而当你大口吃肉的时候，你将禁止可怜的囚徒唱歌；你举行宴会所用的钱是从他可悲的口粮中偷来的，你举行宴会时他将更为悲惨！啊，拿破仑！在你那个时代，是在战场上出生入死争得荣华富贵，那有多美好，现在却要卑鄙地加重穷人的痛苦！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>I  admit that the weakness which Julien displays in this monologue gives me a poor  opinion of him. He would be a worthy colleague for those conspirators in yellow  gloves, who profess to reform all the conditions of life in a great country,  and would be horrified at having to undergo the slightest inconvenience  themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>我承认，于连在这段独白中表现出的软弱使我对他产生了不好的看法。他很可以做那些戴黄手套的阴谋家的同党，他们声称要改变一个国家的全部存在方式，却不愿意让自己的名声受到一点点损害。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was sharply recalled to his proper part. It was not that he might dream and say  nothing that he had been invited to dine in such good company.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>猛然间，于连想起自己的角色。人家请他参加这样高朋满座的午宴，不是让他来胡思乱想一声不吭的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  retired calico printer, a corresponding member of the Academy of Besancon and  of that of Uzes, was speaking to him, down the whole length of the table,  inquiring whether all that was commonly reported as to his astonishing prowess  in the study of the New Testament was true.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一位歇业的印花布制造商，身兼贝藏松和于泽斯两个学士院的院士，从餐桌的另一端向他发话，问大家都说他在《新约》的研究中取得惊  人进展可是真的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  profound silence fell instantly; a New Testament appeared as though by magic in  the hands of the learned member of the two academies. Julien having answered in  the affirmative, a few words in Latin were read out to him at random. He began  to recite: his memory did not betray him, and this prodigy was admired with all  the noisy energy of the end of a dinner. Julien studied the glowing faces of  the women. Several of them were not ill-looking. He had made out the wife of  the collector who sang so well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一下子谁都不说话了；一本拉丁文《新约》神奇地出现在这位博学的两院院士的手中。根据于连的回答，他随口念了半句拉丁文。于连接着背下去，他的记忆力忠实可靠，这件奇事受到七嘴八舌地赞叹，那种喧闹劲儿只有在宴会结束时才会有。于连看了看那几位太太的红扑朴的脸蛋儿，其中有的长得还不错。他特别注意会唱歌的税务官的妻子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Really,  I am ashamed to go on speaking Latin so long before these ladies,' he said,  looking at her. 'If M. Rubigneau' (this was the member of the two academies)  'will be so good as to read out any sentence in Latin, instead of going on with  the Latin text, I shall endeavour to improvise a translation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“当着这些夫人的面说了这么久拉丁文，真不好意思，”他望着她说道，“如果吕比纽先生（就是那位两院院士）肯随意念一句拉丁文，我不接着用拉了文原文回答，看能不能即席翻译出来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  second test set the crown of glory on his achievement.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这第二个测验使他的光荣达到顶点。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  were in the room a number of Liberals, men of means, but the happy fathers of  children who were capable of winning bursaries, and in this capacity suddenly  converted after the last Mission. Despite this brilliant stroke of policy, M.  de Renal had never consented to have them in his house. These worthy folk, who  knew Julien only by reputation and from having seen him on horseback on the day  of the King of ——'s visit, were his most vociferous admirers. 'When will these  fools tire of listening to this Biblical language, of which they understand  nothing?' he thought. On the contrary, this language amused them by its  unfamiliarity; they laughed at it. But Julien had grown tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>席间有好几位富有的自由党人，然而他们也是有可能获得奖学金的孩子们的幸福的父亲，因此上次布道以后突然改变了信仰。尽管他们表  现出这种政治的精明，德·莱纳先生仍不愿在家里接待他们。这些老实人只是耳闻于连的大名，在国王驾临本城那天看见他骑在马上，于是就成了最热烈的崇拜者。“这些傻瓜听到什么时候才会厌烦这种他们一窍不通的圣经风格呢？”相反，这种风格的奇特让他们开心，他们笑个不停。然而，于连厌烦了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He rose gravely as six o'clock struck and  mentioned a chapter? of the new theology  of Liguori, which he had to learn by heart in order to repeat it next day to M.  Chelan. 'For my business,' he added pleasantly, 'is to make other people repeat  lessons, and to repeat them myself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>六点的钟声响了，他严肃地站了起来，谈起利戈里奥的新神学的一章，他得把它记牢，第二天背给谢朗先生听。“因为我的职业，”他愉快地补充说，“是让人背书给我听，也让我背书给别人听。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  audience laughed heartily and applauded; this is the kind of wit that goes down  at Verrieres. Julien was by this time on his feet, everyone else rose,  regardless of decorum; such is the power of genius. Madame Valenod kept him for  a quarter of an hour longer; he really must hear the children repeat their  catechism; they made the most absurd mistakes which he alone noticed. He made  no attempt to correct them. 'What ignorance of the first principles of  religion,' he thought. At length he said goodbye and thought that he might  escape; but the children must next attempt one of La Fontaine's Fables.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>众人听了大笑，赞不绝口；这就是维里埃人所说的机智啊。于连没有坐下，大家也就不顾礼仪地纷纷站了起来，这就是天才的威力。瓦勒诺太太把他多留了一刻钟，请他务必听听孩子们背诵教理问答；他们背得颠三倒四，滑稽透顶，只有他一个人听得出。然而他并不加以纠正。“对宗教的基本原理多么无知啊！”他想。最后，他鞠了一躬，以为可以脱身了，然而不，他还得领教一篇拉封丹寓言。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  author is most immoral,' Julien said to Madame Valenod; 'in one of his Fables  on Messire Jean Chouart, he has ventured to heap ridicule on all that is most  venerable. He is strongly reproved by the best commentators.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是一个很不道德的作家，”于连对瓦勒诺太太说，“有一则关于让·舒阿尔大人的寓言竟敢对最可敬的事物大肆嘲笑。他受到最优秀的批评家的严厉谴责。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Before  leaving the house Julien received four or five invitations to dinner. 'This  young man does honour to the Department,' his fellow-guests, in great hilarity,  were all exclaiming at once. They went so far as to speak of a pension voted  out of the municipal funds, to enable him to continue his studies in Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连在离去之前收到四、五份午宴的请帖。“这年轻人为本省增了光，”宾客们很高兴，齐声说道。他们甚至谈到从公共积金中拨出一笔津贴，让他去巴黎深造。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  this rash idea was making the dining-room ring, Julien had stolen away to the  porch. 'Oh, what scum! What scum!' he murmured three or four times, as he  treated himself to the pleasure of drinking in the fresh air.</p>

<p>正当这个贸然提出的主意在餐厅里引起回响的时候，于连已迅速地跨出大门。“啊，流氓！流氓！”他连着低声喊了三、四次，尽情地呼吸着新鲜的空气。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  felt himself a thorough aristocrat for the moment, he who for long had been so  shocked by the disdainful smile and the haughty superiority which he found  lurking behind all the compliments that were paid him at M. de Renal's. He  could not help feeling the extreme difference. 'Even if we forget,' he said to  himself as he walked away, 'that the money has been stolen from the poor  prisoners, and that they are forbidden to sing as well, would it ever occur to  M. de Renal to tell his guests the price of each bottle of wine that he offers  them? And this M. Valenod, in going over the list of his property, which he  does incessantly, cannot refer to his house, his land and all the rest of it,  if his wife is present, without saying your house, your land.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>此刻他觉得自己完全是个贵族，长久以来，他发现在德·莱纳先生家里人们对他的种种礼貌的深处有一种轻蔑的微笑和高傲的优越，因此很是反感。他不能不感到极大的区别。“忘掉吧，”他边走边对自己说，“甚至忘掉他们从可怜的被收容者身上偷钱，还禁止他们唱歌！德·莱纳先生何曾想过要对他的客人报出他拿出来的每瓶酒的价钱？可是这位瓦勒诺先生呢，他在反复列举他的财产的时候，例如说他的房子、他的产业等等，如果他老婆在场，就总是说您的房子、您的产业。”</p>

<p>This  lady, apparently so conscious of the joy of ownership, had just made an  abominable scene, during dinner, with a servant who had broken a wine-glass and  spoiled one of her sets; and the servant had answered her with the most gross  insolence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这位太太看来对财产的快乐很敏感，午餐中间，她还跟仆人大吵，因为他打碎了一只高脚杯，让她那—打杯子少了—只；而那位仆人回答她时极不客气。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a household!' thought Julien; 'if they were to give me half of all the money  they steal, I wouldn't live among them. One fine day I should give myself away;  I should be unable to keep back the contempt they inspire in me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎样的一帮人啊！”于连想；“即使他们把偷来的钱给我一半，我也不愿意跟他们一起生活。有朝一日，我会暴露的；我不能不让他们在我心中引起的轻蔑表现出来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was obliged, nevertheless, obeying Madame de Renal's orders, to attend several  dinners of this sort; Julien was the fashion; people forgave him his uniform  and the guard of honour, or rather that imprudent display was the true cause of  his success. Soon, the only question discussed in Verrieres was who would be  successful in the struggle to secure the learned young man's services, M. de  Renal or the Governor of the Poor house. These two gentlemen formed with M.  Maslon a triumvirate which for some years past had tyrannised the town. People  were jealous of the Mayor, the Liberals had grounds for complaint against him;  but after all he was noble and created to fill a superior station, whereas M.  Valenod's father had not left him an income of six hundred livres. He had been  obliged to pass from the stage of being pitied for the shabby apple-green coat  in which everybody remembered him in his younger days to that of being envied  for his Norman horses, his gold chains, the clothes he ordered from Paris, in  short, all his present prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是，依照德·莱纳夫人的吩咐，此类午宴必须参加多次；于连走红了；人们原谅了他那身仪仗队服装，或者更可以说，那种冒失正是他成功的真正原因。很快，在维里埃，问题只是看谁在这场争夺博学的年轻人的斗争中获胜，是德·莱纳先生还是收容所所长。这两位先生和马斯隆先生一起形成一种三头政治，多年来在这座城里说一不二。人们嫉妒市长，自由党人怨声载道；但是说到底他是个贵族，生来就高人一等，而瓦勒诺先生的父亲甚至没有给他留下一笔六百利弗尔的年金。对于他，人们得从怜悯过渡到羡慕，怜悯的是他年轻时穿着一套蹩脚的苹果绿衣服，羡慕的是他的诺曼底马、金链、巴黎买来的衣服和眼下的发达。</p>

<p>In  the welter of this world so new to Julien he thought he had discovered an  honest man; this was a geometrician, was named Gros and was reckoned a Jacobin.  Julien, having made a vow never to say anything except what he himself believed  to be false, was obliged to make a show of being suspicious of M. Gros. He  received from Vergy large packets of exercises. He was advised to see much of  his father, and complied with this painful necessity. In a word, he was quite  redeeming his reputation, when one morning he was greatly surprised to find  himself awakened by a pair of hands which were clapped over his eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连面对一个崭新的世界，芸芸众生中他以为发现了一个正直的人，那是一位几何学家，姓格罗，被看作是一个雅各宾党人。于连发过誓只对自己说那些他认为是虚假的事情，因此只能对格罗先生也疑虑重重，他收到从韦尔吉来的大包大包的作业练习。人家还劝他常去看看父亲呢，他履行了这倒霉的义务。一句话，他相当成功地挽回了名誉。一天早上，他突然觉得有两只手捂住了他的眼睛，醒了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was Madame de Renal who had come in to town and, running up stairs four steps  at a time and leaving her children occupied with a favourite rabbit that they  had brought with them, had reached Julien's room a minute in advance of them.  The moment was delicious but all too brief: Madame de Renal had vanished when  the children arrived with the rabbit, which they wanted to show to their  friend. Julien welcomed them all, including the rabbit. He seemed to be once  more one of a family party; he felt that he loved these children, that it  amused him to join in their chatter. He was amazed by the sweetness of their  voices, the simplicity and nobility of their manners; he required to wash his  imagination clean of all the vulgar behaviour, all the unpleasant thoughts the  atmosphere of which he had to breathe at Verrieres. There was always the dread  of bankruptcy, wealth and poverty were always fighting for the upper hand. The  people with whom he dined, in speaking of the joint on their table, made  confidences humiliating to themselves, and nauseating to their hearers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>原来是德·莱纳夫人，她进城了，让孩子们去管那只一路上带着的可爱的兔子，自己大步登上楼梯，先到了于连的房间。这时刻柔情缱绻，只是太短：孩子带着兔子上来，他们想让他们的朋友看看，这时德·莱纳夫人已经躲开。于连热烈地欢迎他们，还有那只兔子。他仿佛又回到了家，他觉得他爱这些孩子，喜欢叽叽喳喳地跟他们说话。他们的声音之温柔，小小举止之单纯和高贵，都让他感到惊奇；在维里埃，他是在粗俗的行为方式和令人不快的思想中呼吸，他需要把这—切从他的想象中清除出去。永远是害怕匿乏，永远是奢侈和贫穷之间的撕打。请他吃饭的那些人，说到餐桌上的烤肉，会吐露出一些心里话，令说的人蒙受耻辱，听的人感到恶心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  aristocrats, you have every reason to be proud,' he said to Madame de Renal.  And he told her of all the dinners he had endured.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你们这些贵族，你们有理由骄傲，”他对德·莱纳夫人说。接着他就给她讲那些他不得不参加的宴会。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why,  so you are in the fashion!' And she laughed heartily at the thought of the  rouge which Madame Valenod felt herself obliged to put on whenever she expected  Julien. 'I believe she has designs on your heart,' she added.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您走红了呀！”她想到瓦勒诺太太每当要见于连时都认为必须搽胭脂，不仅开怀大笑。“我认为她对您有感情上的打算，”她补充说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Luncheon  was a joy. The presence of the children, albeit apparently a nuisance,  increased as a matter of fact the general enjoyment. These poor children did  not know how to express their delight at seeing Julien again. The servants had  not failed to inform them that he was being offered two hundred francs more to  educate the little Valenods.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>早餐十分愉快。孩子们在场，看起来碍事，实际上增加了共同的幸福，这些可怜的孩子又见到于连，真不知道如何证明他们的快乐。仆人  们不会不告诉他们，有人多给他二百法郎，要他去教育那些小瓦勒诺。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the middle of luncheon, Stanislas Xavier, still pale after his serious illness,  suddenly asked his mother what was the value of his silver spoon and fork and  of the mug out of which he was drinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>早餐中间，大病之后还有些苍白的斯坦尼斯拉—克萨维埃突然问母亲他的银餐具和喝水用的高脚杯值多少钱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  do you want to know?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么问这个？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  want to sell them to give the money to M. Julien, so that he shan't be a dupe  to stay with us.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想卖了给于连先生发奖金，好让他跟我们在一起不上当。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  embraced him, the tears standing in his eyes. The mother wept outright, while  Julien, who had taken Stanislas on his knees, explained to him that he must not  use the word dupe, which, employed in that sense, was a servant's expression.  Seeing the pleasure he was giving Madame de Renal, he tried to explain, by  picturesque examples, which amused the children, what was meant by a dupe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连抱住了他，热泪盈眶。他的母亲眼泪已经下来了，于连把斯坦尼斯拉放在膝上，解释这里为什么不能用“上当”这个词，当差的才这  样说。他见德·莱纳夫人高兴，就找些孩子们听了开心的生动例子解释什么是上当。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  understand,' said Stanislas, 'it's the crow who is silly and drops his cheese,  which is picked up by the fox, who is a flatterer.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我懂了，”斯坦尼斯拉悦，“就是乌鸦傻乎乎地让奶酪掉在地上，给拍马屁的狐狸叼走了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal, wild with joy, smothered her children in kisses, which she could  hardly do without leaning slightly upon Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人欣喜若狂，一个劲儿地吻她的孩子们，她这样做不能不略微靠在于连身上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Suddenly  the door opened; it was M. de Renal. His stern, angry face formed a strange  contrast with the innocent gaiety which his presence banished. Madame de Renal  turned pale; she felt herself incapable of denying anything. Julien seized the  opportunity and, speaking very loud, began to tell the Mayor the incident of  the silver mug which Stanislas wanted to sell. He was sure that this story  would be ill received. At the first word M. de Renal frowned, from force of  habit at the mere name of silver. 'The mention of that metal,' he would say,  'is always a preliminary to some call upon my purse.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>突然，门开了，是德·莱纳先生。他那张严厉不满的脸和被他的在场驱走的温馨快乐形成奇特的对比。德·莱纳夫人脸色发白，觉得什么  也否认不了了。于连抢先开口，高声向德·莱纳先生讲述斯坦尼斯拉要变卖银高脚杯的故事。他确信这故事不会受到欢迎。首先德·莱纳先生有个好习惯，只要—听见“银”字就皱眉头。“提到这种金属，”他常说，“总是要从我们的钱袋里掏钱的开场白。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  here there was more than money at stake; there was an increase of his  suspicions. The air of happiness which animated his family in his absence was  not calculated to improve matters with a man dominated by so sensitive a  vanity. When his wife praised the graceful and witty manner in which Julien  imparted fresh ideas to his pupils:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而这里有比银钱利益更多的东西，那就是疑心的加重。他不在，家里就充满欢乐的气氛，这对于一个虚荣心如此易受伤害的人来说绝非一件好事。他的妻子向他夸耀于连如何优雅巧妙地向他的学生们传授新思想，他却暗想：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  yes, I know, he is making me odious to my children; it is very easy for him to  be a hundred times pleasanter to them than I, who am, after all, the master.  Everything tends in these days to bring lawful authority into contempt. Unhappy  France!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是啊！是啊！我知道，他使我的孩子们讨厌我；他很容易在孩子们眼里显得比我可爱百倍，而我却是一家之主。如今这年头，一切都在丑化合法的权威。可怜的法兰西！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal did not stop to examine the implications of her husband's manner. She  had just seen the possibility of spending twelve hours in Julien's company. She  had any number of purchases to make in the town, and declared that she  absolutely must dine in a tavern; in spite of anything her husband might say or  do, she clung to her idea. The children were in ecstasies at the mere word  tavern, which modern prudery finds such pleasure in pronouncing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人继续细心观察丈夫对待她的复杂态度。她已看出有可能和于连一起度过十二个钟头。她在城里有一大堆东西要买，说她一定要去酒馆吃饭；无论她丈夫没什么或做什么，她都坚持她的意见。孩子们一听到“酒馆”两个字，都高兴得不得了，现代的假正经说出这两个字时是多么兴味盎然啊。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal left his wife in the first linen-draper's shop that she entered, to go  and pay some calls. He returned more gloomy than in the morning; he was  convinced that the whole town was thinking about nothing but himself and  Julien. As a matter of fact, no one had as yet allowed him to form any  suspicion of the offensive element in the popular comments. Those that had been  repeated to the Mayor had dealt exclusively with the question whether Julien  would remain with him at six hundred francs or would accept the eight hundred  francs offered by the Governor of the Poorhouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生在妻子进入第一家时装店时就离开了她，去拜访几个人。他回家时脸色比早上还难看；他确信全城黎在议论他和于连。其实谁也还没有向他透露公众议论中让人难堪的部分。人们一再向市长先生提起的，只是于连留在他家里象那六百法郎呢，还是接受收容所长提出的八百法郎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  said Governor, when he met M. de Renal in society, gave him the cold shoulder.  His behaviour was not without a certain subtlety; there is not much thoughtless  action in the provinces: sensations are so infrequent there that people  suppress them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这位所长在社交场所碰见了德·莱纳先生，有意冷落了他一下。此举可称巧妙；在外省，轻率之举本属少见：引起轰动的事情如此之少，有了也让它石沉大海。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Valenod was what is called, a hundred leagues from Paris, a faraud; this is a  species marked by coarseness and natural effrontery. His triumphant existence,  since 1815, had confirmed him in his habits. He reigned, so to speak, at  Verrieres, under the orders of M. de Renal; but being far more active, blushing  at nothing, interfering in everything, everlastingly going about, writing,  speaking, forgetting humiliations, having no personal pretensions, he had  succeeded in equalling the credit of his Mayor in the eyes of ecclesiastical  authority. M. Valenod had as good as told the grocers of the place: 'Give me  the two biggest fools among you'; the lawyers: 'Point me out the two most  ignorant'; the officers of health: 'Let me have your two biggest rascals.' When  he had collected the most shameless representatives of each profession, he had  said to them: 'Let us reign together.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>瓦勒诺先生是距巴黎百里之外的人所说的“混混儿”的那种人；那是一种生性无礼而粗鲁的人。一八一五年以来，他的飞黄腾达更加强了他的这些美妙品质。这么说吧，他是奉德·莱纳先生之命统治维里埃；但是他更为活跃，寡廉鲜耻，插手一切，不停地走动，写信，说话，从不记得对他的侮辱，也没有任何个人的抱负，他终于在教会的势力中动摇了他的主人的信誉。瓦勒诺先生几乎是对当地杂货商们说：把你们当中最愚蠢的两个人给我；对法官们说：告诉我你们当中最无知的两个人是谁；对医生们说：把你们当中最骗人的两个指给我看。他把各行业最无耻的人集合起来，对他们说：让我们一道统治吧。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  manners of these men annoyed M. de Renal. Valenod's coarse nature was offended  by nothing, not even when the young abbe Maslon gave him the lie direct in  public.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生对这些人的作风深感不快。瓦勒诺的粗鲁刀枪不入，就是小马斯隆神甫当众戳穿他的谎言，也无奈他何。</p>
</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But, in the midst of this prosperity, M.  Valenod was obliged to fortify himself by little insolences in points of detail  against the harsh truths which he was well aware that everyone was entitled to  address to him.His  activity had multiplied since the alarms which M. Appert's visit had left in  its wake. He had made three journeys to Besancon; he wrote several letters for  each mail; he sent others by unknown messengers who came to his house at  nightfall. He had been wrong perhaps in securing the deprivation of the old  cure Chelan; for this vindictive action had made him be regarded, by several  pious ladies of good birth, as a profoundly wicked man. Moreover this service  rendered had placed him in the absolute power of the Vicar General de Frilair,  from whom he received strange orders. He had reached this stage in his career  when he yielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter. To add to his  embarrassment, his wife informed him that she wished to have Julien in the  house; the idea appealed to her vanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>然而，在这种发达的中间，瓦勒诺先生还需要不时地搞些小小的无礼之举，用来抵制他感觉到人人都有权向他端出的事实真相。阿佩尔先  生的来访使他大为恐惧，打那以后他的活动变本加厉，他去了两趟贝藏松，每班邮车都写好几封信，他还能过夜里到他家去的陌生人带过几封。也许他不该参与解除谢朗这位老本堂神甫的职务，因为这一报复性行为使得好几位出身高贵的女信徒把他看作恶毒透顶的人。再说，这一次效劳使他完全依附于代理主教德·福利莱，而他也接受过代理主教交办的一些很奇怪的事。正是在他的政治生涯的这个阶段，他写了一封匿名信，暗自品味着快乐。更棘手的是，他的妻子宣布要把于连请到家里来；她的虚荣心使她对此念念不忘。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  this situation, M. Valenod foresaw a final rupture with his former confederate  M. de Renal. The Mayor would address him in harsh language, which mattered  little enough to him; but he might write to Besancon, or even to Paris. A cousin  of some Minister or other might suddenly descend upon Verrieres and take over  the Governorship of the Poorhouse. M. Valenod thought of making friends with  the Liberals; it was for this reason that several of them were invited to the  dinner at which Julien recited. He would find powerful support there against  the Mayor. But an election might come, and it went without saying that the  Poorhouse and a vote for the wrong party were incompatible. The history of  these tactics, admirably divined by Madame de Renal, had been imparted to  Julien while he gave her his arm to escort her from one shop to another, and  little by little had carried them to the Cours de la Fidelite, where they spent  some hours, almost as peaceful as the hours at Vergy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这种情况下，瓦勒诺先生预见到他和旧日的盟友德·莱纳先生之间必有一场决定性的争吵。德·莱纳先生会对他说些严厉的话，这他倒不在乎；但是德·莱纳先生可以往贝藏松甚至巴黎写信。某位大臣的一个亲戚可能突然来到维里埃，把乞丐收容所夺走。瓦勒诺先生于是想到接近自由党人，正是为此几位自由党人被邀出席了于连背书的那次午宴。他若反对市长，本来是可以得到强有力的支持的。然而选举可能突然举行，收容所的职位和投反对票二者不可得兼，这太明显了。这个政治内幕德·莱纳夫人猜得很准，于连挽着她的手一个铺子一个铺子地逛，她就把这段故事讲给他听，说着说着，他们上了忠诚大道，他们在那里消磨了好几个钟头，几乎和在韦尔吉一样宁静。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  this period, M. Valenod was seeking to avoid a final rupture with his former  chief, by himself adopting a bold air towards him. On the day of which we  treat, this system proved successful, but increased the Mayor's ill humour.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，瓦勒诺先生正试图避免跟他的老上司发生决定性的冲突，同时主动对他拿出一副大无畏的神气来。当天这种战术获得成功，但也加深了市长的不满。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Never  can vanity, at grips with all the nastiest and shabbiest elements of a petty  love of money, have plunged a man in a more wretched state than that in which  M. de Renal found himself, at the moment of his entering the tavern. Never, on  the contrary, had his children been gayer or more joyful. The contrast goaded  him to fury.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>虚荣心碰上了爱钱所能有的最贪婪最猥琐的东西，两者之间的搏斗从未使人陷入德·莱纳先生走进酒馆时那样难堪的境地。相反，他的孩子们却从来没有更快活更开心过。这种对比终于刺痛了他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am not wanted in my own family, so far as I can see!' he said as he entered, in  a tone which he sought to make imposing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就我所看见的情景来说，我在这个家里是多余的了！”他走进来装腔作势地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>By  way of reply, his wife drew him aside and explained to him the necessity of  getting rid of Julien. The hours of happiness she had just enjoyed had given  her back the ease and resolution necessary for carrying out the plan of conduct  which she had been meditating for the last fortnight. What really and  completely dismayed the poor Mayor of Verrieres was that he knew that people  joked publicly in the town at the expense of his attachment to hard cash: M.  Valenod was as generous as a robber, whereas he had shown himself in a prudent  rather than a brilliant light in the last five or six subscription lists for  the Confraternity of Saint Joseph, the Congregation of Our Lady, the  Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他妻子的回答只是把他拉在一边，对他说必须让于连离开。她刚刚度过的幸福时光使她获得了为执行考虑了半个月的行动计划所必须的自  如和坚定。使可怕的维里埃市市长彻底陷入混乱的，是他已知道全城都在公开嘲笑他对现金的迷恋。瓦勒诺先生像窃贼一样慷慨，而他呢，在最近为圣约翰兄弟会、圣母会和圣体会等进行的五、六次募捐中表现得过于拘谨，不够漂亮。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Among  the country gentlemen of Verrieres and the neighbourhood, skilfully classified  in the lists compiled by the collecting Brethren, according to the amount of  their offerings, the name of M. de Renal had more than once been seen figuring  upon the lowest line. In vain might he protest that he earned nothing. The  clergy allow no joking on that subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在募集捐款的修士的登记册上，维里埃及附近的绅士们都按捐款数目被巧妙地加以排列，人们不止一次看见德·莱纳先生的名字占据最后一行。他说他不挣钱，但是没有用。在这一条上教士们是不开玩笑的。
