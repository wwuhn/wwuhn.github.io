<p>Fascination!  Thou sharest with love all its energy, all its capacity for suffering. Its  enchanting pleasures, its sweet delights are alone beyond thy sphere. I could  not say, as I saw her asleep: She is all mine with her angelic beauty and her  sweet frailties! Behold her delivered into my power, as heaven made her in its  compassion to enchant a man's heart.</p>
<p>Ode by SCHILLER</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>痴情！你具备爱情的全部力量，它感受不幸的全部力量。只有它的销魂的快乐，它的甜蜜的喜悦却非你所能企及。我看到她睡眠时不能够说：“她连同她天仙般的美貌和她那些可爱的弱点，整个儿属于我！瞧，她被置于我的控制之下，完全像上天在慈悲中为了迷惑一颗男人的心而把她创造成的那样。”</p>
<p>席勒的颂歌</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Obliged  to spend a week in Strasbourg, Julien sought to distract himself with thoughts  of martial glory and of devotion to his country. Was he in love, then? He could  not say, only he found in his bruised heart Mathilde the absolute mistress of  his happiness as of his imagination. He required all his natural energy to keep  himself from sinking into despair.To  think of anything that bore no relation to Mademoiselle de La Mole was beyond  his power. Ambition, the mere triumphs of vanity, had I distracted him in the  past from the sentiments that Madame de Renal inspired in him. Mathilde had  absorbed all; he found her everywhere in his future.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连非得在斯特拉斯堡待上一个礼拜不可，只好转些建立军功、效忠祖国的念头，聊以自遣，他这是爱上了吗？他毫无所知，只是觉得在他那痛苦的心灵里，玛蒂尔德绝对地主宰着他的幸福，他的想象。他需要调动全部的性格力量，才能挺住，不致陷入绝望。想些与德·拉莫尔小姐无关的事情，他做不到。从前，德·莱纳夫人激起的感情，用野心、虚荣心的小小满足就能排遣；如今玛蒂尔德把一切都吸引了去，他举目前瞻，到处都只看见她。</p>

<div class="left">

<p>On  every hand, in this future, Julien foresaw failure. This creature whom we saw  at Verrieres so filled with presumption, so arrogant, had fallen into an absurd  extreme of modesty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连往前后，左右都看不到成功。人们在维里埃看见的那个如此自负、如此骄傲的人，如今陷在可笑的过分谦逊之中。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Three  days earlier he would have killed the abbe Castanede with pleasure, and at  Strasbourg, had a boy picked a quarrel with him, he would have offered the boy  an apology. In thinking over the adversaries, the enemies whom he had  encountered in the course of his life, he found that invariably he, Julien, had  been in the wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>三天之前，他会欣然杀掉卡斯塔奈德神甫，而今在斯特拉斯堡，倘若一个孩子跟他争吵，他会认为那孩子对。他重新想想此生遇见的那些对手，那些敌人，总觉得是他于连错了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  fact was that he had now an implacable enemy in that powerful imagination,  which before had been constantly employed in painting such brilliant successes  for him in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>现在，这种强有力的想象成了他的死敌，而在从前，它可是不断地为他描绘出未来种种辉煌的成功的呀。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  absolute solitude of a traveller's existence strengthened the power of this  dark imagination. What a treasure would a friend have been!'But,'  Julien asked himself, 'is there a heart in the world that beats for me?And  if I had a friend, does not honour impose on me an eternal silence?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>旅人的生活是绝对孤独的，他扩大了这黑色想象的王国的版图。什么样的珍宝能抵得上一个朋友！“但是，”于连对自己说，“难道有一颗心为我跳动吗？即使我有一个朋友，荣誉不是也要命令我永远沉默吗？”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

<p>He  took a horse and rode sadly about the neighbourhood of Kehl; it is a village on  the bank of the Rhine, immortalised by Desaix and Gouvion Saint Cyr. A German  peasant pointed out to him the little streams, the roads, the islands in the  Rhine which the valour of those great Generals has made famous. Julien, holding  the reins in his left hand, was carrying spread out in his right the superb map  which illustrates the Memoirs of Marshal SaintCyr. A joyful exclamation made  him raise his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他骑着马在凯尔的郊外闷闷不乐地徜徉，那是莱茵河畔的一个小镇，因德赛和古维庸·圣西尔而不朽。一个德国农民指给他看一些小溪、道路和河中的的小岛，它们都因两位大将的勇敢而出了名。于连左手拉着马，右手展开圣西尔元帅的《回忆录》中附有的那张精美地图，耳畔一声快乐的叫喊，他抬起了头。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was Prince Korasoff, his London friend, who had expounded to him some months  earlier the first principles of high fatuity. Faithful to this great art,  Korasoff, who had arrived in Strasbourg the day before, had been an hour at  Kehl, and had never in his life read a line about the siege of 1796, began to  explain it all to Julien. The German peasant gazed at him in astonishment; for  he knew enough French to make out the enormous blunders into which the Prince  fell. Julien's thoughts were a thousand leagues away from the peasant's, he was  looking with amazement at this handsome young man, and admiring his grace in  the saddle.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>原来是科拉索夫亲王，这位伦敦结交的朋友几个月前曾经向他披露高级自命不凡的基本原则。科拉索夫忠于这门伟大的艺术，前一天到达斯特拉斯堡，一个钟头前到了凯尔，他这一辈子没读过一行关于一七九六年围城战的文字，此刻却无所不知地对于连大谈起这场围城战。德国农民惊讶地望着他，他懂的法国话足够他听出亲王犯了多少巨大的错误。于连却跟这个农民想的大相径庭，他惊奇地望着这位漂亮的年轻人，欣赏他骑在马上的风度。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'A  happy nature!' he said to himself. 'How well his breeches fit him, how  elegantly his hair is cut! Alas, if I had been like that, perhaps after loving  me for three days she would not have taken a dislike to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难得的好性格啊！”他心里说，“他的裤子多合身，头发剪得多高雅！唉！如果我是这样，也许她不会爱了我三天就讨厌我了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  the Prince had come to an end of his version of the siege of Kehl: 'You look  like a Trappist,' he said to Julien, 'you are infringing the principle of  gravity I taught you in London. A melancholy air can never be the right thing;  what you want is a bored air. If you are melancholy, it must be because you  want something, there is something in which you have not succeeded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>亲王讲完了凯尔围城战，对于连说：“您的脸色像个特拉伯苦修会修士，您夸大了我在伦敦告评您的那个庄重原则。愁容满面不能算有风度，要神情厌倦才行。如果您发愁，这说明您缺了什么，有什么东西您没有成功。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is shewing your inferiority. If you are bored, on the other hand, it is the  person who has tried in vain to please you who is inferior. Realise, my dear  fellow, what a grave mistake you are making.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是自显低下。相反，您若表示厌倦，那就说明低下的东西百般使您愉悦而终属徒劳。因此您要明白，我亲爱的，误解何其严重。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  flung a crown to the peasant who stood listening to them, open mouthed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连扔了一个埃居给那个听得合不上嘴的农民。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good,'  said the Prince, 'that is graceful, a noble disdain! Very good!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好，”亲王说，“有风度，高贵的轻蔑，好极了！”说着，他纵马疾驰而去。于连紧紧跟上，佩服得傻瓜一般。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  he put his horse into a gallop. Julien followed him, filled with a stupefied  admiration.'Ah!  If I had been like that, she would not have preferred Croisenois to me!' The  more his reason was shocked by the absurdities of the Prince, the more he  despised himself for not admiring them, and deemed himself unfortunate in not  sharing them. Self-contempt can be carried no farther.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“啊！要是我这样，她就不会喜欢克鲁瓦泽努瓦胜过喜欢我了！”他的理智越是受到亲王那些可笑之处的冲撞，他就越是鄙视自己不能欣赏它们，因自己没有而感到不幸。他对自己的厌恶简直是无以复加了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Prince found him decidedly melancholy: 'Ah, my dear fellow,' he said to him, as  they rode into Strasbourg, 'have you lost all your money, or can you be in love  with some little actress?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>亲王发现他确实很忧伤。“啊，真的发愁了，我亲爱的朋友，”回到斯特拉斯堡，亲王对他说，“您的钱都丢了吗，还是爱上了一个小女伶？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Russians imitate French ways, but always at a distance of fifty years. They  have now reached the days of Louis XV.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>俄国人模仿法国人的风尚，不过总要差五十年。现在他们刚到路易十五时代。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>These  jests, at the expense of love, filled Julien's eyes with tears: 'Why should not  I consult so friendly a man?' he asked himself suddenly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种关于爱情的戏言，使于连的眼睛里充满了泪水。“我何不向这个可爱的人讨个主意呢？”他忽然暗想道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,  yes, my friend,' he said to the Prince, 'you find me in Strasbourg, madly in  love, indeed crossed in love. A charming woman, who lives in a neighbouring  town, has abandoned me after three days of passion, and the change is killing  me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，是的，我亲爱的，”他对亲王说，“您看见了，我在斯特拉斯堡确实深深地爱上了，而且还遭到冷落。住在邻近城里的一个迷人的女子热恋了三天，竟把我甩了，她的变心使我痛不欲生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  described to the Prince, under an assumed name, the actions and character of  Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他用了假名向亲王描述了玛蒂尔德的行为和性格。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  not go on,' said Korasoff: 'to give you confidence in your physician, I am  going to cut short your confidences. This young woman's husband possesses an  enormous fortune, or, what is more likely, she herself belongs to the highest  nobility of the place. She must be proud of something.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别说完，”科克索夫说，“为了让您信赖您的医生，我来把您的心里话说完。这位少妇的丈夫家财巨万，或者更可能是她属于当地最高的贵族阶层。反正是她有点足堪自豪的东西。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  nodded his head, he had no longer the heart to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连点了点头，他再鼓不起勇气说话了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  good,' said the Prince, 'here are three medicines, all rather bitter,which you  are going to take without delay:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“很好，”亲王说，“这儿有三种相当苦的药，您得立即服下：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'First:  You must every day see Madame —— what do you call her?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一，每天去看……您怎么称呼这位夫人？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Madame  de Dubois.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德·杜布瓦夫人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a name!' said the Prince, with a shout of laughter; 'but forgive me, to you it  is sublime. It is essential that you see Madame de Dubois every day; above all  do not appear to her cold and cross; remember the great principle of your age:  be the opposite to what people expect of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“多怪的名字！”亲王哈哈大笑，“对不起，这名字对您来说是崇高的。必须每天去看德·杜布瓦夫人；但要注意，不要在她面前显出冷淡和生气的样子。想想你们这个世纪的伟大原则吧：与人们对您的期待背道而驰。您要表现得和您一个礼拜之前有幸蒙她厚爱时一模一样。”Show  yourself precisely as you were a week before you were honoured with her  favours.'</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  I was calm then,' cried Julien, in desperation, 'I thought that I pitied her… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！我当时很平静，”于连绝望地叫了起来，“我以为我在怜悯她……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  moth singes its wings in the flame of the candle,' the Prince continued, 'a  metaphor as old as the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“飞蛾扑火必自焚，”亲王说，“像世界一样古老的比喻。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'First  of all: you will see her every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一，您每天去看她。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Secondly:  you will pay court to a woman of her acquaintance, but without any appearance  of passion, you understand? I do not conceal from you, yours is a difficult  part to play: you have to act, and if she discovers that you are acting, you  are doomed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“二，您追求她那个社交圈子里的一个女人，但不要表现出热情，明白吗？我不瞒您，您的角色很难演；您在演戏，但是如果让人猜出您在演戏，那您就完了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p> 'She  is so clever, and I am not! I am doomed,' said Julien sadly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她那么聪明，我这么笨！我完了，”于连愁眉苦脸地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  you are only more in love than I thought. Madame de Dubois is profoundly taken  up with herself, like all women who have received from heaven either too high a  rank or too much money. She looks at herself instead of looking at you, and so  does not know you. During the two or three amorous impulses to which she has  yielded in your favour, by a great effort of imagination, she beheld in you the  hero of her dreams and not yourself as you really are…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不，您只不过是爱得比我想像的还要深罢了。德·杜布瓦夫人在内心深处只想她自己，像所有那些得天独厚的女人一样，或者有太多的尊贵，或者有太多的钱财。她老是看自己，而不看您，因此她不了解您。两、三次爱的冲动之后，她借助想象力的巨大努力，委身于您，她在您身上看见了她梦想的英雄，而不是真实的您……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  what the devil, these are the elements, my dear Sorel, are you still a  schoolboy?…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是，真见鬼，这都是基本常识啊，我亲爱的索莱尔，您难道完全是个小学生不成？……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Egad!  Come into this shop; look at that charming black cravat; you would say it was  made by John Anderson, of Burlington Street; do me the pleasure of buying it,  and of throwing right away that dreadful black rope which you have round your  neck.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“好吧，咱们进这家商店看看；瞧这条可爱的黑领带，简直可以说是伯林顿街的约翰·安德森的出品；请您买下吧，把您脖子上的那根难看的黑绳子扔得远远的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  now,' the Prince went on as they left the shop of the first hosier in  Strasbourg, 'who are the friends of Madame de Dubois? Good God, what a name! Do  not be angry, my dear Sorel, I cannot help it… To whom will you pay court?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“还有，”亲王从斯特拉斯堡最好的那家男于服饰用品店出来，继续说，“德·杜布瓦夫人，伟大的天主，什么名字啊！别生气，我亲爱的索莱尔，我实在没办法……她来往的都是些什么人？您想追求谁呀？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  a prude of prudes, the daughter of an enormously rich stocking merchant. She  has the loveliest eyes in the world, which please me vastly; she certainly  occupies the first place in the district; but amid all her grandeur she blushes  and loses her head entirely if anyone refers to trade and a shop. And  unfortunately for her, her father was one of the best-known tradesmen in  Strasbourg.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一个非常正经的女人，极有钱的袜商的女儿。她有一双世界上最美丽的眼睛，我非常喜欢她；她无疑在当地地位最高，她样样都好，可是只要有人谈起买卖和店铺，她就满脸通红，甚至手足无措。不幸的是，她的父亲曾经是斯特拉斯堡最知名的商人之一。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  that if one mentions industry,' said the Prince, with a laugh, 'you may be sure  that your fair one is thinking of herself and not of you. The weakness is  divine and most useful, it will prevent you from ever doing anything foolish in  her fair eyes. Your success is assured.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果一谈起产业就这样，”亲王笑着说，“您可以肯定您那朝思暮想的美人儿想的是她自己而不是您。这一可笑之处真乃神助，而且很有用，它可以使您在她那美丽的眼睛前面不会有片刻的疯狂。您必定成功。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was thinking of Madame la Marechale de Fervaques, who often came to the Hotel  de La Mole. She was a beautiful foreigner who had married the Marshal a year  before his death. Her whole life seemed to have no other object than to make  people forget that she was the daughter of an industrial, and in order to count  for something in Paris she had set herself at the head of the forces of virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连想的是常去德·拉莫尔府上走动的德·费瓦克元帅夫人。那是一个外国美人儿，嫁给一位元帅，而元帅一年后就死了。她毕生的目标似乎就是让人忘掉她是实业家的女儿，为了在巴黎成个人物，她就带头维护道德。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  admired the Prince sincerely; what would he not have given to have his absurd  affectations! The conversation between the friends was endless; Korasoff was in  raptures: never had a Frenchman given him so long a hearing. 'And so I have  succeeded at last,' the Prince said to himself with delight, 'in making my  voice heard when I give lessons to my masters!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连对亲王心悦诚服，为了听他那些可笑的言谈，他什么代价不肯付出啊！两个朋友说个没完。科拉索夫极为高兴，还从来没有一个法国人这么长时间地听他说话。“这么说，”兴高采烈的亲王心想，“我终于能给我的老师上课了，有人听了！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is quite understood,' he repeated to Julien for the tenth time, 'not a vestige  of passion when you are talking to the young beauty, the Strasbourg stocking  merchant's daughter, in the presence of Madame de Dubois. On the contrary,  burning passion when you write. Reading a well written love letter is a prude's  supreme pleasure; it is a momentary relaxation. She is not acting a part, she  dares to listen to her heart; and so, two letters daily.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我们一致同意，”他第十次对于连说，“您当着德·杜布瓦夫人的面跟斯特拉斯堡的袜商的年轻美丽的女儿说话时，不可有一丁点儿热情。相反，写信时要热情如火。阅读一封写得好的情书乃是正经女人的无上快乐，那是松懈的时刻。她不演戏，敢于倾听内心的呼声；所以，每天要写两封信。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never,  never!' said Julien, losing courage; 'I would let myself be brayed in a mortar  sooner than compose three sentences; I am a corpse, my dear fellow, expect  nothing more of me. Leave me to die by the roadside.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不行！不行！”于连气馁地说；“我宁可被放在臼里捣碎，也不愿意造三个句子；我已是死尸一具，我亲爱的，对我别抱任何希望。让我死在大路边上吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  who said anything about composing phrases? I have in my hold all six volumes of  love letters in manuscript. There are specimens for every kind of woman, I have  a set for the most rigid virtue. Didn't Kalisky make love on Richmond Terrace,  you know, a few miles out of London, to the prettiest Quakeress in the whole of  England?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁让您造句啦？我的包里有六本手抄的的情书。针对各种性格的女人，我还有针对最贞洁的女人的呢。您知道，卡利斯基不是在离伦敦三里远的里奇蒙台地追求过全英国最漂亮的女贵格会教徒吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was less wretched when he parted from his friend at two o'clock in the morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连早晨两点钟离开他的朋友，感到不那么痛苦了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  day the Prince sent for a copyist, and two days later Julien had fifty-three  love letters carefully numbered, intended to cope with the most sublime and  melancholy virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天亲王打发人叫来一个抄写人，两天后于连得到五十三封编了号的情书，都是写给最高尚、最忧郁的贞洁女人的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  would be fifty-four,' said the Prince, 'only Kalisky was shown the door; but  what does it matter to you, being ill-treated by the stocking merchant's  daughter, since you are seeking to influence only the heart of Madame de  Dubois?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不到五十四封，”亲王说，“因为卡利斯基被撵走了。不过，您只想影响德·杜布瓦夫人的心，受到袜商女儿的冷落又有什么关系呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Every  day they went out riding: the Prince was madly taken with Julien. Not knowing  what token to give him of his sudden affection, he ended by offering him the  hand of one of his cousins, a wealthy heiress in Moscow; 'and once you are  married,' he explained, 'my influence and the Cross you are wearing will make  you a Colonel in two years.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们天天骑马，亲王发疯似地喜欢于连。他不知道如何向他证明他这突如其来的友谊，就把他的一个表妹，莫斯科的富有的女继承人许给他。“一旦结了婚，”他说，“我的影响和您的这枚十字勋章可以让您两年内当上上校。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  this Cross was not given me by Napoleon, quite the reverse.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是这枚勋章不是拿破仑给的，那可差远了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  does that matter,' said the Prince, 'didn't he invent it? It is still the first  decoration by far in Europe.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那有什么关系，”亲王说，“不是他创立的吗？它现在仍然是欧洲的第一勋章。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was on the point of accepting; but duty recalled him to the eminent personage;  on parting from Korasoff, he promised to write. He received the reply to the  secret note that he had brought, and hastened to Paris; but he had barely been  by himself for two days on end, before the thought of leaving France and  Mathilde seemed to him a punishment worse than death itself. 'I shall not wed  the millions that Korasoff offers me,' he told himself, 'but I shall follow his  advice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连差不多要接受了，但是他的责任要求他回到大人物那儿去。他离开科拉索夫时，答应写信，他收到了对他送来的秘密记录的答复，朝巴黎飞奔而去；但是他刚刚连续独处了两天，就觉得离开法国和玛蒂尔德对他来说是一种比死亡还痛苦的折磨。“我不会和科拉索夫给我的几百万结婚，”他对自己说，“不过，我会听从他的建议。”</p>
