<div class="layout">
  <div class="right"><p>杜河水面上方一百尺，沿小山有一公共散步道，需要修筑一堵巨大的挡土墙。对于德·莱纳先生的政声来说，这真是一次千载难逢的好机会。散步道所处位置极佳，入眼的乃是法国最秀丽的风光。不过，每到春季，雨水一冲，路面就沟壑纵横，坑洼遍地，殊难涉足，人人都感到不便，德·莱纳先生就趁机修了一堵二十尺高二百多尺长的墙，非如此是不足以使他的政绩永垂不朽的。</p>
    </div>
  
  <div class="left">Fortunately for M. de Renal's reputation as an administrator, a huge retaining wall was required for the public avenue which skirts the hill side a hundred feet above the bed of the Doubs. To this admirable position it is indebted for one of the most picturesque views in France. But,every spring, torrents of rainwater made channels across the avenue,carved deep gullies in it and left it impassable. This nuisance, which affected everybody alike, placed M. de Renal under the fortunate obligation to immortalise his administration by a wall twenty feet in height and seventy or eighty yards long.
    
  </div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">为了这墙上的胸墙，德·莱纳先生不得不三上巴黎，因为前前任内务部长自称是维里埃的散步道的死敌；如今这胸墙已经起来，离地四尺高。仿佛是向一切现任和前任的部长们示威似的，眼下有人正在往上装方石板。</div>
  
  <div class="left">The parapet of this wall, to secure which M. de Renal was obliged to make three journeys to Paris, for the Minister of the Interior before last had sworn a deadly enmity to the Verrieres avenue; the parapet of this wall now rises four feet above the ground. And, as though to defy all Ministers past and present, it is being finished off at this moment with slabs of dressed stone.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">有多少次啊，我的胸抵着泛出美丽的蓝灰色的巨大石块，心里想着昨夜告别的巴黎的舞会，眼睛却眺望着杜河的谷地！远处，左岸，五六条山谷曲折蜿蜒，其深处有数条小溪历历在目，一路奔泻跳荡，急匆匆跌进杜河。山里的太阳很猛，正当顶的时候，旅人却可在这方平台上享受枝叶婆娑的悬铃木的荫护，任遐想驰骋。这些树生长迅速，美丽的绿色微含蓝意，这都得力于市长先生命人填在巨大的防土墙后面的新土，因为他不顾市议会的反对，硬是把散步道拓宽了六尺（尽管他是极端保王党人，我是自由党人，这件事我还是要称赞他），因此，他和幸运的乞丐收容所所长瓦勒诺先生都认为，这个平台比圣日尔曼—昂—莱的平台并不逊色。
</div>

  <div class="left">How often, my thoughts straying back to the ballrooms of Paris,which I had forsaken overnight, my elbows leaning upon those great blocks of stone of a fine grey with a shade of blue in it, have I swept with my gaze the vale of the Doubs! Over there, on the right bank, are five or six winding valleys, along the folds of which the eye can make out quite plainly a number of little streams. After leaping from rock to rock, they
may be seen falling into the Doubs. The sun is extremely hot in these mountains; when it is directly overhead, the traveller's rest is sheltered on this terrace by a row of magnificent planes. Their rapid growth, and handsome foliage of a bluish tint are due to the artificial soil with which the Mayor has filled in the space behind his immense retaining wall, for,despite the opposition of the town council, he has widened the avenue by more than six feet (although he is an Ultra and I myself a Liberal, I give him credit for it), that is why, in his opinion and in that of M. Valenod, the fortunate governor of the Verrieres poorhouse, this terrace is worthy to be compared with that of Saint-Germainen-Laye.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">For my part, I have only one fault to find with the Cours de la Fidelite;one reads this, its official  title, in fifteen or twenty places, on marble slabs which have won M. de Renal yet another Cross; what I should be inclined to condemn in the Cours de la Fidelite is the barbarous manner in which the authorities keep these sturdy plane trees trimmed and pollarded. Instead of suggesting, with their low, rounded, flattened heads, the commonest of kitchen garden vegetables, they would like nothing better than to assume those magnificent forms which one sees them wear in England. But the Mayor's will is despotic , and twice a year every tree belonging to the commune  is pitilessly lopped. The Liberals of the place maintain, but they exaggerate, that the hand of the official gardener has grown much more severe since the Reverend Vicar Maslon formed the habit of appropriating the clippings.</div>
  <div class="right">散步道的正式名称是忠诚大道，见于沿路十五或二十块大理石板上，这又使德·莱纳先生获得一枚十字勋章。我只有一件事要指责这条忠诚大道，那就是市政当局让人修剪乃至剃秃这些茁壮的悬铃木的那种野蛮方式。这些树与其让自己的脑袋低而圆，圆而平，活象园子里最平常的蔬菜，宁可要英国花园里常见的那种漂亮大方的外形。然而市长先生的意志不可违抗，属市政府所有的那些树每年都要两度遭此无情的残害。当地的自由党人声称（当然有些夸张），自从马斯隆副本堂神甫养成了把修剪下来的树枝据为己有的习惯之后，市府的园丁的手变得愈发无情了。</div></div>
<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This young cleric was sent from Besancon, some years ago, to keep an eye upon the abbe Chelan and certain parish priests of the district. An old Surgeon-Major of the Army of Italy, in retirement at Verrieres, who in his time had been simultaneously, according to the Mayor, a Jacobin and a Bonapartist, actually ventured one day to complain to him of the periodical mutilation of these fine trees.</div>
  <div class="right">这位年轻的教士是几年前从贝藏松派来监视谢朗神甫和附近几位本堂神甫的。有一位外科老军医，曾在意大利打过仗，退伍来到了维里埃，据市长先生说，他生前既是雅各宾党人又是波拿巴分子，有一次竟敢当面抱怨对这些美丽的树所施行的周期性毁伤。</div></div>

  
  
<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I like shade,' replied M. de Renal with the touch of arrogance appropriate when one is addressing a surgeon, a Member of the Legion of Honour; 'I like shade, I have my trees cut so as to give shade, and I do not consider that a tree is made for any other purpose, unless, like the useful walnut, it yields a return.'</div>
  <div class="right">“我喜欢荫凉，”德·莱纳先生回答说，口气中有一种居高临下的意味，但对一个身为荣誉团骑士的外科医生说话还就得这样才见得合适；“我喜欢荫凉，我让人修剪我的树，为的是有更多的荫凉，—棵树若不能像有用的胡桃树那样带来收益，我想不出它还能有别的什么用处。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">There you have the great phrase that decides everything at Verrieres:
YIELD A RETURN; it by itself represents the habitual thought of more
than three fourths of the inhabitants.
</div>
  <div class="right">“带来收益”，这就是在维里埃决定一切的至理名言。单单这个词就代表了四分之三的居民的习惯性思想。</div></div>
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Yielding a return is the consideration that settles everything in this little town which seemed to you, just now, so attractive. The stranger arriving there, beguiled by the beauty of the cool, deep valleys on every side,imagines at first that the inhabitants are influenced by the idea of beauty;they are always talking about the beauty of their scenery: no one can deny that they make a great to do about it; but this is because it attracts a certain number of visitors whose money goes to enrich the inn-keepers,and thus, through the channel of the rate-collector, yields a return to the town.</div>
  <div class="right">在这座您觉得如此美丽的小城里，带来收益，乃是决定一切的大道理。初到此地的外乡人醉心于周围那清凉幽深的山谷，首先会想到居民们对美很敏感；他们也的确没少把本地的美丽风光挂在嘴上，人们也不能否认他们对此看得很重，因为美丽的风光招来了外地人，而游客的钱富了旅店老板，于是就通过税收的渠道给城市带来收益。</div></div>


 <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was a fine day in autumn and M. de Renal was strolling along the Cours de la Fidelite, his lady on his arm. While she listened to her husband, who was speaking with an air of gravity, Madame de Renal's eye was anxiously following the movements of three little boys. The eldest,who might be about eleven, was continually running to the parapet as though about to climb on top. A gentle voice then uttered the name Adolphe, and the child abandoned his ambitious project . Madame de Renal looked like a woman of thirty, but was still extremely pretty.</div>
  <div class="right">一个晴朗的秋日，德·莱纳先生让妻子挽着胳膊，在忠诚大道上散步，他说话的神情很严肃，德·莱纳夫人听着，眼睛却不安地注视着她的三个孩子的动静。大孩子能有十一岁，总是靠近胸墙，并且做出要爬上去的样子。于是一个温柔的声音唤出了阿道夫这名字，那孩子遂放弃了他的雄心壮志。德·莱纳夫人看上去有三十岁，依然相当漂亮。
</div></div>

 <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'He may live to rue the day, that fine gentleman from Paris,' M. de Renal was saying in a tone of annoyance, his cheek paler even than was its wont. 'I myself am not entirely without friends at Court… .'</div>
  <div class="right">“他会后悔的，巴黎来的这位漂亮先生，”德·莱纳先生忿忿地说，脸色比平时更加苍白，“我在宫里也不是没有朋友……”。
</div></div>

 <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But albeit I mean to speak to you of provincial life for two hundred pages, I shall not be so barbarous as to inflict upon you the tedium and all the clever turns of a provincial dialogue.</div>
  <div class="right">虽然我很愿意用二百页的篇幅跟您谈谈外省，但是我毕竟不能如此残忍，让您忍受外省的谈话所具有的那种冗长和那种巧妙的转弯抹角。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This fine gentleman from Paris, so odious to the Mayor of Verrieres,was none other than M. Appert, who, a couple of days earlier, had contrived to make his way not only into the prison and the poorhouse of Verrieres, but also into the hospital, administered gratuitously by the Mayor and the principal landowners of the neighbourhood.</div>
  <div class="right">在维里埃市长眼中如此可恶的这位巴黎来的漂亮先生不是别人，正是阿佩尔先生，两天前，他不仅设法进入维里埃的监狱和乞丐收容所，还进入了市长和当地主要的业主义务管理的医院。</div></div>
   <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'But,' Madame de Renal put in timidly, 'what harm can this gentleman from Paris do you, since you provide for the welfare of the poor with the most scrupulous honesty?'
</div>
  <div class="right">“可是，”德·莱纳夫人怯生生地说，“既然您清白廉洁地管理着穷人的福利，巴黎来的这位先生又能把您怎么样呢？”
</div></div>

   <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'He has only come to cast blame, and then he'll go back and have articles put in the Liberal papers.'
</div>
  <div class="right">他们是为了找茬儿才来的，然后就在自由党的报纸上写文章。
</div></div>


   <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'You never read them, my dear.'

</div>
  <div class="right">“可您从来不看这些报纸呀，我的朋友。”

</div></div>


   <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'But people tell us about those Jacobin articles; all that distracts us, and hinders us from doing good.As for me, I shall never forgive the cure.'
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>“可人家跟我们谈论这些雅各宾派的文章呀；这都使我们受到干扰，欲做好事而不能。哼，我呀，我永远不会原谅这个本堂神甫。”</p>
