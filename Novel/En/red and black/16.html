</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连幸运地保住了名誉，德·莱纳夫人太激动、太惊讶了，看不到这个转眼间成为她全部生命的男人的愚蠢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  she was imploring him to withdraw, seeing the day begin to break:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她见天快大亮，催促他快走：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  Heavens!' she said, 'if my husband has heard any sound, I am lost.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！我的天主，”她说，“要是我丈夫听见了响动，我就完了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  who had leisure for composing phrases, remembered one to the point:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连居然还有工夫玩弄词藻，他想起这么一句：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Should  you regret your life?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您对生活有悔吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Very much at this moment, but I should not regret having known you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“噢！此时此刻多好啊！但我绝不后悔认识了您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  found that his dignity required him to return to his room in broad daylight and  with deliberate want of precaution.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连故意在天大亮时大模大样地回去，他感到了他的尊严。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  continuous attention with which he watched his own slightest actions, in the insane  idea of being taken for a man of experience, had this one advantage; when he  saw Madame de Renal again, at luncheon, his behaviour was a miracle of  prudence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一直在研究自己种种细小的动作，极荒唐地想显出一副老手的样子，这种持续的关注只有一样好处；他在吃午饭时再见德·莱纳夫人  时，他的举止简直是谨慎的一件杰作。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for her, she could not look at him without blushing to the whites of her eyes,  and could not live for an instant without looking at him; she noticed her own  confusion, and her efforts to conceal it increased. Julien raised his eyes to  hers once only. At first, Madame de Renal admired his prudence. Presently,  seeing that this solitary glance was not repeated,she took alarm: 'Can it be  that he does not love me any more,' she asked herself; 'alas, I am far too old  for him; I am ten years his senior.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>而她呢，她一看他脸就通红，可不看他又一刻也过不下去；她觉察到自己的慌乱，竭力掩饰却又适得其反，于连只抬眼望过她一次。开始，德·莱纳夫人很欣赏他的谨慎，很快，她见他只看过她一次就不再看了，不免慌了神：“难道他不再爱我了吗？”她心里嘀咕，“唉！我对他来说是太老了，我比他大十岁呀。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the way from the dining-room to the garden, she pressed Julien's hand. In the  surprise that he felt at so extraordinary a token of affection,he gazed at her  with passion; for she had struck him as looking very pretty at luncheon, and,  without raising his eyes, he had spent his time making a detailed catalogue of  her charms. This look consoled Madame de Renal; it did not remove all her  uneasiness; but her uneasiness removed, almost entirely, the remorse she felt  when she thought of her husband.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>从餐厅到花园的路上，她握住了开连的手。这一如此不寻常的爱情表示使他惊讶，他望着她，目光中充满了热情，因为吃午饭的时候他觉得她很漂亮，当时他把时间都用来细细地品味她的魅力了。这目光给德·莱纳夫人带来了慰藉，虽然没有完全解除她的不安，她的不安却几乎完全解除了她对丈夫的内疚。</p>




</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  luncheon, the said husband had noticed nothing; not so with Madame Derville;  she feared Madame de Renal to be on the point of succumbing. All through the  day, her bold, incisive friendship did not spare the other those hinted  suggestions intended to portray in hideous colours the danger that she was  running.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>吃午饭时，这位丈夫什么也没有察觉，可德尔维夫人就不一样了：她相信德·莱纳夫人就要屈服了。整个白天，出于勇敢而果断的友情，她没少用隐晦的语言为德·莱纳夫人所冒的风险描绘一幅色彩丑恶的图画。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal was burning to be left alone with Julien; she wanted to ask him  whether he still loved her. Despite the unalterable gentleness of her nature,  she was more than once on the point of letting her friend know what a nuisance  she was making of herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人心急如焚，盼着和于连单独在一起；她想问他还爱不爱她。尽管她的性格极其温柔，她还是好几次差一点让她的朋友明白，她是多么地缠人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, in the garden, Madame Derville arranged things so skilfully that she  found herself placed between Madame de Renal and Julien. Madame de Renal, who  had formed a delicious image of the pleasure of pressing Julien's hand and  carrying it to her lips, could not so much as address a word to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上在花园里，德尔维夫人做了巧妙的安排，自己坐在德·莱纳夫人和于连中间。德·莱纳夫人原来为自己的快乐勾画了一个美妙的图景，她握着于连的手，凑近自己的嘴唇，可现在连一句话也不能跟他说了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  catastrophe increased her agitation. Remorse for one thing was gnawing her. She  had so scolded Julien for the imprudence he had shown in coming to her room the  night before, that she trembled lest he might not come that night. She left the  garden early, and went up to wait in her room. But, beside herself with  impatience, she rose and went to glue her ear to Julien's door. Despite the  uncertainty and passion that were devouring her, she did not dare enter. This  action seemed to her the last word in lowness, for it serves as text to a  country maxim.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种意外使她更加骚动不宁。悔恨噬咬着她的心。她曾经那样地责备于连不谨慎，头天夜里到她那里去，现在却担心他今夜不再去了。她早早地离开花园，回到自己房里安歇。但是，她情急难耐，就跑到于连的门口，把耳朵贴在门上倾听。疑虑和情欲吞噬着她，可她不敢进去。这种举动在她看来是最最可耻的了，因为外省的一则谚语说的就是这种事。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  servants were not all in bed. Prudence obliged her finally to return to her own  room. Two hours of waiting were two centuries of torment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>仆人们有的还没有睡。谨慎终于迫使她回到自己房里。两个小时的等待就是两个世纪的折磨。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  Julien was too loyal to what he called his duty, to fail in the execution,  detail by detail, of what he had laid down for himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不过，于连是太忠于他所谓的责任了，他不会不逐项地完成他为自己规定的事情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  one o'clock struck, he slipped quietly from his room, made sure that the master  of the house was sound asleep, and appeared before Madame de Renal. On this  occasion he found greater happiness with his mistress, for he was less  continually thinking of the part he had to play.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一点的钟声响了，他轻轻溜出房门，确信主人己经睡熟，就来到德·莱纳夫人的房里。这一次，他在女友的身边感到了更多的幸福，因为  他不再时时想到他要扮演的角色了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  had eyes to see and ears to hear. What Madame de Renal said to him about his  age contributed to give him some degree of self-assurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他有眼睛要看了，有耳朵要听了。德·莱纳夫人关于她的年龄说的那些话也让他的心定了定。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Alas!  I am ten years older than you! How can you love me?' she repeated without any  object, simply because the idea oppressed her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“唉！我比您大十岁呀！您怎么能爱上我呢？”她反复地说，也没有什么意图，只是因为这念头压迫着她。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  could not conceive such a thing, but he saw that her distress was genuine, and  almost entirely forgot his fear of being ridiculous.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连倒没有想过这种不幸，不过他也看出这不幸确是实实在在的，他也就把害怕成为笑柄的心理忘得差不多了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  foolish idea of his being regarded as a servile lover, at his mistress's beck  and call, on account of his humble birth, vanished like wise. In proportion as  Julien's transports reassured his coy mistress, she recovered some degree of  happiness and the faculty of criticising her lover. Fortunately, he showed  almost nothing, on this occasion, of that borrowed air which had made their  meeting the night before a victory, but not a pleasure. Had she noticed his  intentness upon playing a part, the painful discovery would have robbed her of  all happiness for ever. She could have seen in it nothing else than a painful  consequence of their disparity of age.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他原以为自己出身微贱，会被她看作是一个地位低下的情夫，这种愚蠢的念头也消失了。于连的狂热使他那胆怯的情妇渐渐放下心来，她  又感到了一点点幸福，并且又有了评判她的情夫的能力。幸好他这一次几乎没有那种做作的神情，那可是把昨夜的幽会变成了一次胜利，而不是一次欢情。假使她觉察到他在用心扮演一个角色，这种可悲的发现将会把她的幸福剥夺净尽。她只能看到年龄的不配所造成的一种可悲的后果。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Albeit  Madame de Renal had never thought about theories of love, difference of age is,  next to difference of fortune, one of the great common places of provincial  humour, whenever there is any talk of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>虽然德·莱纳夫人从未想过那些爱情的理论，但在外省，一谈到爱情，年龄的差别总是在财产之后成为开玩笑的另一大老话题。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  a few days, Julien, all the ardour of his youth restored, was madly in love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不多几天，于连恢复了他这个年纪的全部热情，爱得神魂颠倒。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  must admit,' he said to himself, 'that her kindness of heart is angelic, and  that no one could be prettier.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“应该承认，”他想，“她心地善良得像天使，而且没有人比她更漂亮了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  had almost entirely lost the idea of a part to be played. In a moment of  unrestrained impulse, he even confessed to her all his anxieties.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他几乎完全失去了演戏的念头。在放任纵情的时刻，他甚至向她承认了他全部的忧虑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  confidence raised to its climax the passion that he inspired. 'So I have not  had any fortunate rival,' Madame de Renal said to herself with ecstasy. She  ventured to question him as to the portrait in which he took such an interest;  Julien swore to her that it was that of a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这番倾诉把他所激起的热情推向极点。“这么说我  那情敌还不曾幸福过！”德·莱纳夫人想，不由得心花怒放。她大着胆子问到他如此关心的那幅肖像，于连发誓说那是一个男人的肖像。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  Madame de Renal was calm enough to reflect, she could not get over her  astonishment that such happiness could exist and that she had never had the  slightest idea of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当德·莱纳夫人还有足够的冷静可以思考时，她简直惊奇得不得了，世上居然还有这样的幸福存在，她居然连想都没想过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!'  she said to herself, 'if I had known Julien ten years ago, when I might still  be considered pretty!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊！”她想，“我要是十年前认识于连该有多好！那时候我还能说是漂亮。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  thoughts were worlds apart from these. His love was still founded in ambition:  it was the joy of possessing—he, a poor creature so unfortunate and so  despised—so noble and beautiful a woman. His acts of adoration, his transports  at the sight of his mistress's charms, ended by reassuring her somewhat as to  the difference in age. Had she possessed a little of that worldly wisdom a  woman of thirty has long enjoyed in more civilised lands, she would have  shuddered for the continuance of a love which seemed to exist only upon  surprise and the titillation of self-esteem.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连绝想不到这些。他的爱情仍然是一种野心，那是一种占有的喜悦，他，一个如此不幸、如此遭人蔑视的可怜虫，而她，一个如此高贵  、如此美丽的女人。他那些爱慕的举动，他看见女友的魅力所流露出的激情，终于使她对年龄的差异稍许放心了。在更为开化的地区，一个三十岁的女人早就有了一些处世经验，如果德·莱纳夫人略具一些此种经验，她会担心一种只靠惊奇和自尊心的满足来维持的爱情能否长久。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien went into transports over  everything that Madame de Renal possessed, including her hats and gowns. He  could not tire of the pleasure of inhaling their perfume. He opened her  wardrobe and stood for hours on end marvelling at the beauty and neat  arrangement of everything inside. His mistress,leaning upon his shoulder, gazed  at him; he himself gazed at those ornaments and fripperies which on a wedding day  are displayed among the presents.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在他把野心抛诸脑后的那些时刻里，于连连德·莱纳夫人的帽子、衣裙都狂热地赞赏不已。它们散发的香气使他快乐，总也闻不够。他打开她的带镜衣橱，几个小时地站在那里，欣赏着他在里面发现的那些东西的美和整洁。他的女友依偎着他，望着他；他呢，他望着这些仿佛新郎送的结婚礼物一样的首饰和衣物。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  might have married a man like this!' Madame de Renal sometimes thought; 'What a  fiery spirit! What a rapturous life with him!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我原本可以嫁给一个这样的男人！”德·莱纳夫人有时想，“一颗如此火热的心啊！跟他在一起会过上一种多么快乐的生活啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for Julien, never had he found himself so close to those terrible weapons of  feminine artillery. 'It is impossible,' he told himself, 'that in Paris there  can be anything finer!' After which he could find no objection to his  happiness. Often his mistress's sincere admiration, and her transports of  passion made him forget the fatuous theory that had kept him so restrained and  almost ridiculous in the first moments of their intimacy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>至于于连，他还从未这样靠近过女人这支炮队的那些可怕的武器。“就是在巴黎，”他想，“也不可能有更漂亮的东西了！”于是他对他  的幸福不再有任何异议。情妇的真诚的赞赏，她的狂热，常常使于连忘掉那种无用的理论，这理论在这场私情的最初时刻使他变得那么刻板，甚至可笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  were moments when, despite his hypocritical habits, he found an intense  pleasure in confessing to this great lady who admired him his ignorance of any  number of little usages. His mistress's rank seemed to raise him above himself.  Madame de Renal, for her part, found the most exquisite moral satisfaction in  thus instructing in a heap of little things this young man endowed with genius  whom everyone regarded as bound one day to go so far. Even the Sub-Prefect and  M. Valenod could not help admiring him: she thought the better of them  accordingly. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>尽管虚伪已成了他的习惯，但仍有这样的时候，他觉得向这位钦佩他的高贵的夫人承认他对一大堆细小习俗一窍不通是一种极大的快乐。他的情妇的地位似乎使他超越了自己，德·莱纳夫人则觉得在一大堆小事情上开导这位才华横溢、人人都认为前程远大的年轻人，是一种最甜蜜的精神快乐。这个年轻人，甚至专区区长和瓦勒诺先生也不能不佩服，为此，她觉得他们不那么愚蠢了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for Madame Derville, these were by no means her sentiments. In despair at what  she thought she could discern, and seeing that her wise counsel was becoming  hateful to a woman who had positively lost her head, she left Vergy without  offering an explanation for which she was not asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>至于德尔维夫人，她可远远没有这样的看法。她对她相信自己已经猜中的事情感到绝望，眼见明智的劝告被一个实实在在昏了头的女人视为可憎，就离开了韦尔吉，没有说明原因，别人也避免问她。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal shed a few tears at her departure, and soon it seemed to her that her  happiness was doubled. By the withdrawal of her guest she found herself left  alone with her lover almost all day long.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人洒了几滴眼泪，很快就觉得她的幸福成倍地增加了。德尔维夫人这一走，她几乎可以整个白天单独和情人在一起了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  gave himself all the more readily to the pleasant society of his mistress  inasmuch as, whenever he was left too long by himself,Fouque's fatal offer  recurred to his mind to worry him. In the first days of this new life, there  were moments when he, who had never loved,who had never been loved by anyone,  found so exquisite a pleasure in being sincere, that he was on the point of confessing  to Madame de Renal the ambition which until then had been the very essence of  his existence. He would have liked to be able to consult her as to the strange  temptation which he felt in Fouque's offer, but a trifling occurrence put a  stop to all frankness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连也很愿意沉湎在他的情人的温柔陪伴之中，因为他若独处的时间太长，富凯的那个决定命运的建议就会来撩拨他。新生活的最初几天，从未爱过也从未被爱过的于连觉得做个真诚的人是那么甜蜜愉快，差点儿向德·莱纳夫人坦白他的野心，这野心迄今为止一直是他生活的本质。富凯的建议一直对他有一种奇怪的诱惑力，他想能不能就此问问她的意见，但是发生了一件小事，任何的坦诚都不可能了。
