</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left quo1 ">
<p>The  splendour of the dresses, the blaze of the candles, the perfumes; all those rounded  arms, and fine shoulders; bouquets, the sound of Rossini's music, pictures by  Ciceri! I am beside myself!</p>
<p>Travels of Uzer</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>服饰的奢华，烛火的辉煌，香水的芬芳；那么多的漂亮胳膊，那么多的美丽肩膀！花束！令人陶醉的罗西尼的曲子，西赛里的绘画！我已经心醉神迷了。</p>
<p>《于泽里游记》</p></div>
</div>
 
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>'You  are feeling cross,' the Marquise de La Mole said to her; 'I warn you, that is  not good manners at a ball.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您不高兴，”德·拉莫尔侯爵夫人对她说，“我警告您：这在舞会上很没有风度。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is only a headache,' replied Mathilde contemptuously, 'it is too hot in here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我只是感到头疼，”玛蒂尔德爱搭不理地回答说，“这里太热了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  that moment, as though to corroborate Mademoiselle de La Mole, the old Baron de  Tolly fainted and fell to the ground; he had to be carried out. There was talk  of apoplexy, it was a disagreeable incident.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，好像要证实德·拉奥尔小姐的话似的，托利老男爵突然，头晕，昏倒了，不得不被抬出去。有人说是中风，真是一件扫兴的事。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  did not give it a thought. It was one of her definite habits never to look at  an old man or at anyone known to be given to talking about sad things.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德不闻不问。她有既定方针，绝不理会那些老人和就喜欢说坏事的人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She danced to escape the conversation about  the apoplexy, which was nothing of the sort, for a day or two later the Baron  reappeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她跳舞，避开关于中风的谈话，其实男爵并没有中风，因为他第二天又露面了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But M. Sorel does not appear,' she said to  herself again after she had finished dancing. She was almost searching for him  with her eyes when she caught sight of him in another room. Strange to say, he  seemed to have shed the tone of impassive coldness which was so natural to him;  he had no longer the air of an Englishman.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“索莱尔先生还不来，”她跳过舞之后又在想。她几乎要用眼睛找他了，突然发现他在另一间客厅里，怪事，他好像失去了对他来说如此  自然的那种不动声色的冷淡态度，他不再有英国人的神气了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He is talking to Conte Altamira, my  condemned man!' Mathilde said to herself. 'His eye is ablaze with a sombre  fire; he has the air of a Prince in disguise; the arrogance of his gaze has  increased.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他在跟我的死刑犯阿尔塔米拉伯爵说话呢！”玛蒂尔德心想，“他的眼睛里燃烧着一股阴沉的火；他就像一个乔装的王子；他的目光更加骄傲了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien was coming towards the spot where  she was, still talking to Altamira; she looked fixedly at him, studying his  features in search of those lofty qualities which may entitle a man to the  honour of being sentenced to death.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一边和阿尔塔米拉说着话，一连走近她呆的那个地方；她凝视着他，研究他的表情，想从中发现那些使一个人有幸被判死刑的高超品质。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As he passed by her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他从她身边走过的时候，对阿尔塔米拉伯爵说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,' he was saying to Conte Altamira,  'Danton was a man!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，丹东是个男子汉！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh, heavens! Is he to be another Danton,'  thought Mathilde; 'but he has such a noble face, and that Danton was so  horribly ugly, a butcher, I fancy.' Julien was still quite near her, she had no  hesitation in calling to him; she was conscious and proud of asking a question  that was extraordinary, coming from a girl.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“天哪！他会是个丹东吗？”玛蒂尔德对自己说，“可是他的面孔是那么高贵，而那个丹东却丑得可怕，我觉得简直是个屠夫。”于连走  得更近了些，她毫不犹豫地叫住他，她有意而且骄傲地提出了一个问题，这个问题对一个女孩子来说是很不寻常的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Was not Danton a butcher?' she asked him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“丹东不是一个屠夫吗？”她对他说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes, in the eyes of certain people,'  Julien answered her with an expression of the most ill-concealed scorn, his eye  still ablaze from his conversation with Altamira, 'but unfortunately for people  of birth, he was a lawyer at Merysur Seine; that is to say, Mademoiselle,' he  went on with an air of sarcasm, 'that he began life like several of the Peers  whom I see here this evening. It is true that Danton had an enormous  disadvantage in the eyes of beauty: he was extremely ugly.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，在某些人的眼中是，”于连回答说，带着一种掩饰不住的轻蔑的表情，眼睛里还因与阿尔塔米拉的谈话而闪着火花，“然而不幸  的是，对于出身高贵的人来说，他是塞纳河畔梅里地区的律师；这就是说，小姐，”他满脸凶相地补充说，“他的开始跟我在这里看见的好几位贵族院议员完全一样。的确，在一个美人的眼中，丹东有一个巨大的错点，他很丑。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The last words were uttered rapidly, with  an extraordinary and certainly far from courteous air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这最后几个字说得很快，口气很特别，但也肯定很不礼貌。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien waited for a moment, bowing slightly  from the waist and with an arrogantly humble air. He seemed to be saying: 'I am  paid to answer you, and I live upon my pay.' He did not deign to raise his eyes  to her face. She, with her fine eyes opened extraordinarily wide and fastened  upon him, seemed like his slave. At length, as the silence continued, he looked  at her as a servant looks at his master, when receiving orders. Although his  eyes looked full into those of Mathilde, still fastened upon him with a strange  gaze, he withdrew with marked alacrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连等了片刻，上身微微前倾，神态谦卑却又透着傲气。似乎在说：“我是花钱雇来回答您的，而我靠我的工钱生活。”他甚至不屑抬眼  看看玛蒂尔德。而她呢，一双美丽的眼睛睁得老大，盯着他，倒像是他的奴隶。最后，谁都不说话，他望着她，就像奴仆望着主人，等待吩咐。玛蒂尔德一直盯着他，目光奇特，最后，他一面死死地盯着她的眼睛，一面显然是急匆匆地离去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That he, who really is so handsome,'  Mathilde said to herself at length, awakening from her dreams, 'should pay such  a tribute to ugliness!Never a thought of himself! He is not like  Caylus or Croisenois. This Sorel has something of the air my father adopts when  he is playing the Napoleon, at a ball.'She had entirely forgotten Danton. 'No  doubt about it, I am bored this evening.' She seized her brother by the arm,  and, greatly to his disgust, forced him to take her for a tour of the rooms.  The idea occurred to her of following the condemned man's conversation with  Julien</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他的确很美，”她缓过神来，心里说，“却这样地赞美丑陋！脱口而出，绝不反悔！他不是凯吕斯或克鲁瓦泽努瓦那种人。这个索莱尔的神态有点儿像我父亲在舞会上模仿得那么像的拿破仑。”她完全忘了丹东。“今天晚上，我确实感到厌倦。”她抓住她哥哥的胳膊，不管他老大不乐意，逼着他跟她在舞场上转一圈。原来她是想听听死刑犯和于连的谈话。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The crowd was immense. She succeeded,  however, in overtaking them at the moment when, just in front of her, Altamira  had stopped by a tray of ices to help himself. He was talking to Julien, half  turning towards him. He saw an arm in a braided sleeve stretched out to take an  ice from the same tray. The gold lace seemed to attract his attention; he  turned round bodily to see whose this arm was. Immediately his eyes, so noble  and unaffected, assumed a slight expression of scorn. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>人群挤作一大团。但是她还是追上了，相距两步远，阿尔塔米拉正步近一个托盘拿冷饮，半侧着身子。他看见一只穿着绣花衣服的胳膊正在拿旁边的一杯冷饮。绣花衣服似乎引起了他的注意；他完全转过身来，想看看这只胳膊是哪一位的。顿时，他那如此高贵、如此天真的眼睛流露出一丝厌恶。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You see that man,' he murmured to Julien;  'he is the Principe d'Araceli, the — Ambassador. This morning he applied for my  extradition to your French Foreign Minister, M. de Nerval. Look, there he is  over there, playing whist. M. de Nerval is quite ready to give me up, for we  gave you back two or three conspirators in 1816. If they surrender me to my King  I shall be hanged within twenty-four hours. And it will be one of those pretty  gentlemen with moustaches who will seize me.' </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您看那个人，”他对于连说，声音相当低；“那是某国大使德·阿拉塞利亲王。今天上午，他向你们法国外交部长德·奈瓦尔先生要求引渡我。看，他就在那儿打惠斯脱牌。德·奈瓦尔先生也准备把我交出去，因为我们在一八一六年交给你们两、三个阴谋分子。如果他们把我交给我的国王，我将在二十四小时内被吊死。而且抓我的就是这些留小胡子的漂亮先生们中的一位。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The wretches!' exclaimed Julien, half  aloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“无耻！”于连说，声音相当高。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde did not lose a syllable of their  conversation. Her boredom had vanished.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德听得一字不漏。厌倦已无影无踪。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Not such wretches as all that,' replied  Conte Altamira. 'I have spoken to you of myself to impress you with a real  instance. Look at Principe d'Araceli; every five minutes he casts a glance at  his Golden Fleece; he cannot get over the pleasure of seeing that trinket on  his breast. The poor man is really nothing worse than an anachronism. A hundred  years ago, the Golden Fleece was a signal honour, but then it would have been  far above his head. Today, among people of breeding, one must be an Araceli to  be thrilled by it. He would have hanged a whole town to obtain it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这还不那么无耻，”阿尔塔米拉伯爵又说。“我跟您谈我是为了给您一个强烈的印象。您看看阿拉塞利亲王，每隔五分钟，他就要看一  眼他的金羊毛勋章；他看见这种喂鸟的小饼挂在胸前，高兴得不行。这可怜的人不过是个不合时宜仙人罢了。一百年前，金羊毛勋章是一种无上的荣誉，但是那个时候他这种人是根本得不到的。今天，在出身高贵的人中间，只有阿拉塞利这种人才对它心醉神迷。他为了得到它可以把全城的人都绞死。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Was that the price he paid for it?' said  Julien, with anxiety.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他是花了这个代价才得到的吗？”于连焦急地问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Not exactly,' replied Altamira coldly; 'he  perhaps had some thirty wealthy landowners of his country, who were supposed to  be Liberals, flung into the river.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不完全是这样，”阿尔塔米拉冷冷地答道；“他也许是把他的国家里被认为是自由党人的三十来个富有的产业主扔进了河里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What a monster!' said Julien again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“多没有心肝的人啊！”于连说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole, leaning forward with the keenest interest, was so close to him that  her beautiful hair almost brushed his shoulder. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐怀着最强烈的兴趣歪看头听，离得那么近，她那美丽的头发几乎碰着他的肩膀了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> 'You are very young!' replied  Altamira. 'I told you that I have a married sister in Provence; she is still  pretty, good, gentle; she is an excellent mother, faithful to all her duties,  pious without bigotry.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您很年轻！”阿尔塔米拉说，“我跟您说过，我有一个姐姐嫁到了普罗旺斯；她还很漂亮，善良、温柔；是个极好的家后主妇，忠于她  的一切职责，虔诚但不装假。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What is he leading up to?' thought  Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“他想说什么呢，”德·拉莫尔小姐想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She is happy,' Conte Altamira continued;  'she was happy in 1815. At that time I was in hiding there, on her property  near Antibes; well, as soon as she heard of the execution of Marshal Ney, she  began to dance!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她是幸福的，”阿尔塔米拉伯爵继续说，“她在一八一五年时也是幸福的。那时候我藏在她家里，在她的靠近昂提布的领地上；您瞧，  当她听说奈伊元帅被处决时，竟跳起舞来！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is  it possible?' said the horrified Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是可能的吗？”于连说，惊呆了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is the partisan spirit,' replied Altamira. There are no longer any genuine  passions in the nineteenth century; that is why people are so bored in France.  We commit the greatest cruelties, but without cruelty.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是党派精神，”阿尔塔米拉说，“十九世纪不罢有真正的激情了，因此人们在法国才这么厌倦。人们做着最残忍的事，却没有残忍的  精神。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'All  the worse!' said Julien; 'at least, when we commit crimes, we should commit  them with pleasure: that is the only good thing about them, and the only excuse  that can in any way justify them.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就更糟！”于连说，“至少，当人们犯罪的时候也应该有犯罪的乐趣，罪行也只有这点儿好处，甚至以此为理由来稍微为罪行做些辩护。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole, entirely forgetting what she owed to herself, had placed herself  almost bodily between Altamira and Julien. Her brother, upon whose arm she  leaned, being accustomed to obey her, was looking about the room, and, to hide  his lack of composure, pretending to be held up by the crowd.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐完全忘了她该做什么了，几乎完全夹在了阿尔塔术拉和于连当中。她的哥哥习惯于服从她，让她挽着胳膊，望着客厅里别的地方，为了掩饰窘态而装出被人群挡住的样子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are right,' said Altamira; 'we do everything without pleasure and without  remembering it afterwards, even our crimes. I can point out to you at this ball  ten men, perhaps, who will be damned as murderers.They  have forgotten it, and the world also.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您说得对，”阿尔塔米拉说；“人们什么都干，就是没有乐趣，也记不住，甚至犯罪也是如此。在这个舞会上，我也许能给您指出十个人来，他们可以被判为杀人凶乎，他们忘了，别人也忘了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Many  of them are moved to tears if their dog breaks its paw. At Pere Lachaise, when  people strew flowers on their graves, as you so charmingly say in Paris, we are  told that they combined all the virtues of the knights of old, and we hear of  the great deeds of their ancestor who lived in the days of Henri IV: If,  despite the good offices of Principe d'Araceli, I am not hanged, and if I ever  come to enjoy my fortune in Paris, I hope to invite you to dine with nine or  ten murderers who are honoured and feel no remorse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有的人，如果他们养的狗腿断了，他们会心疼得流泪。在拉雪兹神甫公墓，当人们把鲜花抛向他们的坟墓时，你们巴黎人说得那么有趣，有人就会告诉我们，他们兼有勇敢的骑士的种种美德，还有人会谈到他们的生活在亨利四世治下的曾祖辈的丰功伟绩。如果阿拉塞利亲王费尽周折，我仍未被绞死，而且我一旦享用我在巴黎的财产，我愿意请您跟八个到十个受人敬重、毫无悔恨之心的杀人犯一块儿吃饭。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  and I, at that dinner, will be the only two whose hands are free from blood,  but I shall be despised and almost hated, as a bloody and Jacobinical monster,  and you will simply be despised as a plebeian who has thrust his way into good  society.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您和我，我们将是这顿晚饭上唯一没有沾上鲜血的人，但是，我将被当作嗜血成性的、雅各宾派的怪物受岁鄙视，甚至憎恨，而您将只作为一个混入上流社会的平民而受到鄙视。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Nothing  could be more true,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“再真实不过了，”德·拉莫尔小姐说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Altamira  looked at her in astonishment; Julien did not deign to look at her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿尔塔米拉惊讶地望着她，于连则不屑一顾.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Note  that the revolution at the head of which I found myself,' Conte Altamira went  on, 'was unsuccessful, solely because I would not cut off three heads, and  distribute among our supporters seven or eight millions which happened to be in  a safe of which I held the key. My King, who is now burning to have me hanged,  and who, before the revolt, used to address me as tu, would have given me the  Grand Cordon of his Order if I had cut off those three heads and distributed  the money in those safes: 'A malcontent is speaking.' (Note by Moliere to  Tartuffe.) for then I should have scored at least a partial success, and my  country would have had a Charter of sorts… Such is the way of the world, it is  a game of chess.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请注意，我带头搞的那队革命没有成功，”阿尔塔米拉伯爵继续说，“仅仅是因为我不愿意砍掉三个脑袋，不愿意把七、八百万分给我  们的拥护者，我掌握着金库的钥匙，今天，我的国王渴望着绞死我，而在叛乱之前，他用‘你’来称呼我；如果我把三个脑袋砍了，把金库里的钱分了，他会把他的大勋章颁给我，因为我至少可以取得一半成功，我的国家也会有一个像样的宪章……世上的事就是这样，不过一局棋罢了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Then,'  replied Julien, his eyes ablaze, 'you did not know the game; now … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那时，”于连接着说，眼里冒着火，“您还不会下，而现在……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should cut off the heads, you mean, and I should not be a Girondin as you gave  me to understand the other day? I will answer you,' said Altamira sadly, 'when  you have killed a man in a duel, and that is a great deal less unpleasant than  having him put to death by a headsman.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您是不是想说，我会砍掉一些人的脑袋，我不会成为您曾向我解释的那种吉伦特派？……我要回答您，”阿尔塔米拉神情忧郁地说，“  要是您在决斗中杀了人，那就远不像让一个刽子手处决他那么丑恶。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Faith!'  said Julien, 'the end justifies the means; if, instead of being a mere atom, I  had any power, I would hang three men to save the lives of four.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“依我看，”于连说，“要达目的，不择手段，假如我不是个微不足道的人，有几分权力的话，我可以为了救四个人而杀三个人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  eyes expressed the fire of conscience and a contempt for the vain judgments of  men; they met those of Mademoiselle de La Mole who stood close beside him, and  this contempt, instead of changing into an air of gracious civility, seemed to  intensify.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的眼睛里闪烁着真诚的火焰和对世人虚妄评判的轻蔑；他的眼睛碰上了紧挨着他的德·拉莫尔小姐的眼睛。但那轻蔑远没有变成优雅和  温良，反而象是变本加厉了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It shocked her profoundly; but it no longer  lay in her power to forget Julien; she moved indifferently away, taking her  brother with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她深受刺激，但是已经不能忘掉于连了；她感到恼怒，拉着她哥哥走了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  must take some punch, and dance a great deal,' she said to herself, 'I intend  to take the best that is going, and to create an effect at all costs.Good,  here comes that master of impertinence, the Comte de Fervaques.'She  accepted his invitation; they danced. 'It remains to be seen,' she thought,  'which of us will be the more impertinent, but, to get the full enjoyment out  of him, I must make him talk.' Presently all the rest of the country dance  became a pure formality. No one was willing to miss any of Mathilde's piquant  repartees. M. de Fervaques grew troubled, and, being able to think of nothing  but elegant phrases, in place of ideas, began to smirk; Mathilde, who was out  of temper, treated him cruelly, and made an enemy of him. She danced until daybreak,  and finally went home horribly tired. But, in the carriage, the little strength  that remained to her was still employed in making her melancholy and wretched.  She had been scorned by Julien, and was unable to scorn him</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我该去喝潘趣酒，大跳其舞，”她对自己说，“我要挑一个最好的，不惜一切代价引人注目。好啊，这是那个出了名的无礼之徒，费瓦  克伯爵。”她接受了他的邀请，他们跳舞了。“咱们看看谁最放肆，”她想，“不过，为了嘲弄个够，我得让他开口说话。”很快，其他参加四组舞的人不过是装装样子，谁也不想漏掉一句玛蒂尔德的尖酸刻薄的俏皮话。德·费瓦克伯爵心慌意乱，找不出一句有思想的话，只好拿些风雅辞今应付，一脸的怪相；玛蒂尔德心里有火，待他很残酷，简直当成了仇敌。她一直跳到天亮，下场时已疲惫不堪。在回去的车子里，剩下的一点儿力气还被用来让她感到悲哀和不幸。她被于连蔑视，却不能蔑视他。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was on a pinnacle of happiness. Carried away unconsciously by the music, the  flowers, the beautiful women, the general elegance, and, most of all, by his  own imagination, which dreamed of distinctions for himself and of liberty for  mankind:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连感到幸福到了极点。他不知不觉地陶醉于音乐、鲜花、美女和普遍的豪华，尤其是陶醉于他的想象，他梦想着自己的荣耀，他梦想着一切人的自由。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a fine ball!' he said to the Conte, 'nothing is lacking.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“多美的舞会！”他对伯爵说，“什么都不缺了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Thought  is lacking,' replied Altamira.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“还缺思想，”阿尔塔米拉回答说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  his features betrayed that contempt which is all the more striking because one  sees that politeness makes it a duty to conceal it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的表情泄露了轻蔑，这轻蔑就更加刺人，因为看得出来，礼节要求必须隐藏这种轻蔑。</p>

<p>'You  are here, Monsieur le Comte. Is not that thought, and actively conspiring,  too?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您在呀，伯爵先生。是不是思想还在策划着什么阴谋？”</p>

<p>'I  am here because of my name. But they hate thought in your drawing-rooms. It  must never rise above the level of a comic song: then it is rewarded. But the  man who thinks, if he shows energy and novelty in his sallies, you call a  cynic. Is not that the name that one of your judges bestowed upon Courier? You  put him in prison, and Beranger also.Everything  that is of any value among you, intellectually, the Congregation flings to the  criminal police; and society applauds.</p>

<p>“我在这里是因为我的姓氏。在你们的客厅里，人们僧恨思想。它不能超出歌舞剧的一句歌词的讽刺，这样它就会受到奖赏。然而思想着  的人，如果在他的俏皮话里有毅力有新意，你们就叫他犬儒主义者。你们的一位法官送给库里埃的不就是这个名称吗？你们把他投入监狱，像贝朗瑞一样。在你们这儿，凡是精神方面稍有价值的东西，圣会就将其送上轻罪法庭，上流社会则鼓掌叫好。</p>

<p>'The  truth is that your antiquated society values conventionality above everything…  You will never rise higher than martial gallantry; you will have Murats, but  never a Washington. I can see nothing in France but vanity. A man who thinks of  things as he speaks may easily say something rash, and his host then imagines  himself insulted.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是因为你们这个衰老的社会首先看重的是礼仪……你们永远超不出匹夫之勇，你们可以有缪拉，但永远不会有华盛顿。我在法国只看见了虚荣。一个说话有创见的人脱口说了句不谨慎的俏皮话，而主人就以为是丢了脸。”</p>

<p>At  this point, the Conte's carriage, which was taking Julien home, stopped at the  Hotel de La Mole. Julien was in love with his conspirator.Altamira  had paid him a handsome compliment, evidently springing from a profound  conviction: 'You have not the French frivolity, and you understand the  principle of utility.' It so happened that, only two evenings before, Julien  had seen Marino Faliero, a tragedy by M. Casimir Delavigne.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>说到这里，伯爵的车子带着于连，在德·拉莫尔府前面停下了。于连喜欢上了他的阴谋家。阿尔塔米拉给过他一句漂亮的赞语，但显然不是出自一种深刻的确信：“您没有法国人的轻浮，好好理解功利原则吧。”正好前天于连读过卡西米尔·德拉维涅先生的悲剧《玛利诺·法利埃罗》。</p>

<p>'Has  not Israel Bertuccio more character than all those Venetian nobles?' our  rebellious plebeian asked himself; 'and yet they are men whose noble descent  can be proved as far back as the year 700, a century before Charlemagne;  whereas the bluest blood at M. de Retz's ball to night does not go farther  back, and that only by a hop, skip and jump, than the thirteenth century. Very  well! Among those Venetian nobles, so great by birth, it is Israel Bertuccio  that one remembers.</p>

<p>“伊斯拉埃尔·贝尔蒂西奥，他不是比所有那些威尼斯贵族更有性格吗？”我们这位愤怒的平民对自己说，“然而这些人的被证实的贵族血统可以上溯至公元七００年，比查理曼大帝还早一个世纪；而今晚德·雷斯公爵的舞会上，最高贵的也只能上溯至十三世纪，还是连滚带爬的呢。好！尽管那些威尼斯贵族出身如此高贵，可人们记住的却是伊斯拉埃尔·贝尔蒂西奥。</p>

<p>“在这个瓦勒诺们和莱纳们的世纪里，今天的丹东会是什么呢？怕连国王的代理检察官都不是……</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>'What  am I saying? He would have sold himself to the Congregation; he would be a  Minister, for after all the great Danton did steal. Mirabeau, too, sold  himself. Napoleon stole millions in Italy, otherwise he would have been brought  to a standstill by poverty, like Pichegru. Only La Fayette never stole. Must  one steal, must one sell oneself?' Julien wondered.The  question arrested the flow of his imagination. He spent the rest of the night  reading the history of the Revolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我在说什么呀？他会把自己出卖给圣会，他会当部长，因为这位伟大的丹东偷盗过。米拉波也出卖过自己。拿破仑在意大利偷盗过几百  万，否则他会像皮舍格吕一样被贫穷一下子难倒。只有拉斐德从不曾偷盗过。应该偷盗吗？应该出卖自己吗？”于连想。这个问题一下子把他难住了。夜里剩下的时间里，他读大革命的历史。</p>

<p>Next  day, as he copied his letters in the library, he could still think of nothing  but Conte Altamira's conversation.</p>

<p>'It  is quite true,' he said to himself, after a long spell of absorption; 'if those  Spanish Liberals had compromised the people by a few crimes, they would not  have been swept away so easily. They were conceited, chattering boys … like  myself!' Julien suddenly cried, as though awaking with a bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“事实上，”他好一阵出神，然后对自己说，“如果这些西班牙自由党人把人民牵连进罪行里去，是不会这么容易就被清除掉的。这是些  骄傲的、夸夸其谈的孩子……像我一样！”于连突然叫道，仿佛大梦方醒，跳了起来。</p>

<p>'What  difficult thing have I ever done that gives me the right to judge poor devils  who, after all, once in their lives, have dared, have begun to act? I am like a  man who, on rising from table, exclaims: &quot;Tomorrow I shall not dine; that  will not prevent me from feeling strong and brisk as I do today.&quot; How can  I tell what people feel in the middle of a great action? … ' These lofty  thoughts were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Mademoiselle de La Mole, who  at this moment entered the library. He was so excited by his admiration for the  great qualities of Danton, Mirabeau, Carnot, who had contrived not to be  crushed, that his eyes rested upon Mademoiselle de La Mole, but without his  thinking of her, without his greeting her, almost without his seeing her. When  at length his great staring eyes became aware of her presence, the light died  out in them.Mademoiselle  de La Mole remarked this with a feeling of bitterness.</p>

<p>“我做过什么艰难的事情，有权利评判这些可怜的家伙？他们究竟在一生中有过一次敢于并且开始了行动呀。我就似是那个人，离开饭桌时大声说：‘明天我不吃饭了，这丝毫也不妨碍我像今天一样健壮、敏捷。’谁知道在一个伟大行动的半途中会有什么感觉呢？……”德·拉莫尔小姐走进图书室，这意外打断了他那些高深的思想。他赞赏丹东、米拉波、卡诺这些不会被征服的人的伟大品质，兴奋不已，眼睛停在德·拉莫尔小姐身上，却没有想到她，没有向她敬礼，几乎没有看见她。当他那双睁得如此开的大眼睛终于觉察到她的存在时，目光顿时暗了下去。德·拉莫尔小姐注意到了，感到一阵酸楚。</p>

<p>In  vain did she ask him for a volume of Vely's Histoire de France which stood on  the highest shelf, so that Julien was obliged to fetch the longer of the two  ladders. He brought the ladder; he found the volume, he handed it to her, still  without being able to think of her. As he carried back the ladder, in his  preoccupation, his elbow struck one of the glass panes protecting the shelves;  the sound of the splinters falling on the floor at length aroused him. He  hastened to make his apology to Mademoiselle de La Mole; he tried to be polite,  but he was nothing more.Mathilde  saw quite plainly that she had disturbed him, that he would have preferred to  dream of what had been occupying his mind before her entry, rather than to talk  to her. </p>

<p>她向他要维利的《法国史》，书放在最上一格，她够不着。于连不得不去搬两架梯子中最高的那一架。于连搬来梯子，拿到书，送给她，还是想不到她。他在撤走棋子时，因为心思不在那上面，胳膊肘碰在书橱的一块玻璃上。咣啷一声，碎片落在地上，这才惊醒了他。他急忙向德·拉莫尔小姐道歉，他想礼貌些，他也只能如此了。玛蒂尔德看得明白，她打搅了他，比起跟她说话来，他更愿意想她来之前他的那些事。</p>

<p>After a long glance at him, she slowly left the room. Julien watched  her as she went. He enjoyed the contrast between the simplicity of the attire  she was now wearing and her sumptuous magnificence overnight. The difference in  her physiognomy was hardly less striking. This girl, so haughty at the Ducde  Retz's ball, had at this moment almost a suppliant look. 'Really,' Julien told  himself, 'that black gown shows off the beauty of her figure better than  anything; but why is she in mourning?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她看了他好久，然后慢慢地走了。于连看着她走过去。眼前这朴素的打扮和昨晚那豪华的服饰形成对比，看得于连来了兴致。两种面貌之间的差别几乎也给人留下深刻的印象。这个女孩子在德·雷斯公爵的舞会上是那样的高傲，此刻眼神里竟几乎含着哀求。“的确，”于连心想，“这黑色的连衣裙更显出她腰身的美。她有女王的作派，可是她为什么要戴孝？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  I ask anyone the reason of this mourning, I shall only make myself appear a  fool as usual.' Julien had quite come to earth from the soaring flight of his  enthusiasm. 'I must read over all the letters I have written today; Heaven  knows how many missing words and blunders I shall find.' As he was reading with  forced attention the first of these letters, he heard close beside him the  rustle of a silken gown; he turned sharply round; Mademoiselle de La Mole was  standing by his table, and smiling.This  second interruption made Julien lose his temper.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果我问给谁戴孝，可能我又是干了件蠢事。”于连完全从极度兴奋的状态中走出来了。“我得重新读一读早晨写的信，谁知道我会找出多少漏掉的字和愚蠢的错误，”他正勉强集中精力读第一封信，却听见身旁响起一阵绸裙的悉卒声；他迅速转过头，德·拉莫尔小姐站在离他的桌子两步远的地方，正在笑呢。这第二次打扰使于连生气了。</p>

</div></div>

<p>As  for Mathilde, she had just become vividly aware that she meant nothing to this  young man; her smile was intended to cover her embarrassment, and proved successful.</p>

<p>'Evidently,  you are thinking about something that is extremely interesting, Monsieur Sorel.  Is it by any chance some curious anecdote of the conspiracy that has sent the  Conte Altamira here to Paris? Tell me what it is? I am burning to know; I shall  be discreet, I swear to you!' This last sentence astonished her as she uttered  it. What, she was pleading with a subordinate! Her embarrassment grew, she  adopted a light manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“显然，您在想什么很有趣的事情，索莱尔先生。是不是有关那被阴谋的什么奇闻软事？正是那桩阴谋把阿尔塔米拉伯爵先生送到巴黎来  的。告诉我是怎么回事，我很想知道；我会严守秘密的，我向您发誓！”她听见自已竟说出这句话来，不免大吃一惊，怎么，她竟恳求一个下人！她更加局促不安，遂用一种轻松的口吻补充说：</p>

<div class="right">

<p>这种尖锐而唐突的询问深深地伤了于连，重又激起他全部的疯狂。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'Was  Danton justified in stealing?' he said to her sharply, and with an air that  grew more and more savage. 'The Revolutionaries of Piedmont, of Spain, ought  they to have compromised the people by crimes? To have given away, even to men  without merit, all the commands in the army, all the Crosses? Would not the men  who wore those Crosses have had reason to fear a Restoration of their King?  Ought they to have let the Treasury in Turin be pillaged? In a word,  Mademoiselle,' he said, as he came towards her with a terrible air, 'ought the  man who seeks to banish ignorance and crime from the earth to pass like a  whirlwind and do evil as though blindly?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“丹东偷盗是对的吗？”他突然对她说，神情变得越来越凶。“皮埃蒙特的革命党人，西班牙的革命党人，他们应该把人民牵连进一些罪  行中去吗？他们应该把军队里所有的职位、把所有的十字勋章给那些甚至没有功劳的人吗？戴上这些勋章的人难道不怕国王回来吗？应该让都灵的金库遭到抢劫吗？总之，小姐，”他一边神色可怕地步近她，一边说，“想把愚味和罪恶逐出地球的人应该像暴风雨一扫而过茫无目的地作恶吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>Mathilde  was afraid, she could not meet his gaze, and recoiled a little.She  looked at him for a moment; then, ashamed of her fear, with a light step left  the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德害怕了，承受不住他的目光，倒退了两步。她看了看他，对自己的恐俱感到羞耻，轻轻地快步走出图书室。
