<p>It is because I was foolish then that I am  now wise. O philosopher who see nothing save in a flash, how short is your  vision! Your eye is not made to follow the underground working of the passions.</p>
<p>FRAU VON GOETHE</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>这是因为我那时候疯狂，而今天我变得明智了。啊，仅能看到瞬间之内的事物的哲学家，你的目光多么短浅！你的眼睛不可能观察那些热情的隐蔽的变化。</p>
<p>歌德</p></div>

<p>This conversation  was interrupted by a judicial examination, followed by a conference with the  lawyer retained for the defence. These were the only absolutely disagreeable  moments in a heedless existence full of tender fantasies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们的谈话被一次审讯打断，接着便是和辩护律师进行磋商。这是一段充满了漫不经心和温柔梦幻的生活中仅有的绝对令人不快的时刻。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It was murder, and premeditated murder,'  said Julien to magistrate and counsel alike. 'I am sorry, gentlemen,' he added,  smiling; 'but this reduces your task to a very small matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“这是杀人，而且是预谋杀人，”于连对法宫和对律师都这么说。“我很遗憾，先生们，”他微微一笑，补充说，“不过这就让你们的工作不成气候了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'After all,' thought Julien, when he had  succeeded in ridding himself of these two persons, 'I must be brave, and  braver, evidently, than these two men. They regard as the worst of evils, as  the king of terrors, this duel to a fatal issue, of which I shall begin to  think seriously only upon the day itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“无论如何，”于连终于摆脱了这两个人，对自上说，“我得有勇气，看起来要比这两个人有勇气。他们把这场导致不幸结局的较量对作最大的痛苦，看作恐惧之王，我可要到了那一天才认真对待它。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That is because I have known a greater  evil,' Julien continued, philosophising to himself. 'I suffered far more keenly  on my first journey to Strasbourg, when I thought that I had been abandoned by  Mathilde…And to think that I longed with such passion  for this perfect intimacy which today leaves me so unmoved! Indeed, I am  happier by myself than when that lovely girl shares my solitude … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是因为我遭受过更大的不幸，”于连继续跟自己探讨哲理。“我第一次去斯特拉斯堡，那时我以为已被玛蒂尔德抛弃，我的痛苦要比现在大得多……不料我怀着那样的激情渴望的那种完全的亲密今天却使我冷若冰霜！……事实上，比起让这个如此美丽的姑娘分享我的孤独来，我一个人独处感到更幸福……”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The lawyer, a man of rules and formalities,  thought him mad, and supposed, with the rest of the public, that it was  jealousy that had put the pistol in his hand. One day, he ventured to suggest  to Julien that this allegation, whether true or false, would be an excellent  line of defence. But the prisoner became in a flash passionate and incisive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>律师是个循规蹈矩、恪守形式的人，以为于连疯了，他和公众一样认为，是嫉妒让于连拿起了枪。一天，他试着让于连明白，不管是真是假，这种说法是一条辩护的途径。可是被告的态度转眼间变得激烈而尖锐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'On your life, Sir,' cried Julien beside  himself with rage, 'bear in mind never again to utter that abominable  falsehood.' The prudent advocate was afraid for a moment of being murdered  himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“以您的生命的名义，先生，”于连叫道，勃然大怒，“请您记住，不要再散布这种可恶的谎言了。”谨慎的律师一时竟害怕自己也被谋杀了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He prepared his defence, because the  decisive moment was rapidly approaching. Besancon and the whole Department  could talk of nothing but this cause celebre. Julien was in ignorance of this,  he had begged that no one should ever speak to him of such matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他准备辩护词，因为决定性的时刻迅速逼近。贝藏松及全省上下尽在谈论这宗有名的案子，于连不知道这些细节，他曾要求永远不要跟他谈这些事情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That very day, Fouque and Mathilde having  sought to inform him of certain public rumours, which seemed to them to furnish  grounds for hope, Julien had cut them short at the first word.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一天，富凯和玛蒂尔德想告诉他一些传闻，据他们看，这些传闻可以带来希望，他们一开口，于连就不让说下去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Leave me to enjoy my ideal life. Your petty  bickerings, your details of real life, all more or less irritating to me, would  bring me down from heaven. One dies as best one can; as for me, I wish to think  of death only in my own way. What do I care for other people? My relations with  other people are soon to be cut short. For pity's sake, do not speak to me of them  again: it is quite enough to have to see the magistrate and my counsel.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让我过我理想的日子吧。你们那些烦人的小事，你们那些多少总让我生气的现实生活的细节，会把我从天上拉下来。一个人能怎么死就怎么死，我哪，我只愿意按照我的方式去想死亡。别人跟我有什么关系！我和别人的关系就要一刀两断了。求求你们，别再跟我说这些人了，看见法官和律师已经够了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indeed,' he said to himself, 'it appears to  be my destiny to die in a dream. An obscure creature, like myself, sure of  being forgotten within a fortnight, would indeed be foolish, one must admit,  were he to play a part …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“事实上，”他对自己说，“看来我的命运是作着梦死。肯定不出半个月，我就会被人遗忘，应该承认，像成这样默默无闻的人，还想装模作样，真是太傻了……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is strange, all the same, that I have  learned the art of enjoying life only now that I see its term draw so near.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过奇怪的是，直到我看见了生命的终点这样靠近我，我才知道了享受生活的艺术。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He spent these last days in pacing the  narrow terrace on the roof of his dungeon, smoking some excellent cigars for  which Mathilde had sent a courier to Holland, and with no suspicion that his  appearance was daily awaited by all the telescopes in the town. His thoughts  were at Vergy.Never did he speak of Madame de Renal to  Fouque, but on two or three occasions this friend told him that she was  recovering rapidly, and these words echoed in his heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最后那段日子里，他整天在主塔楼顶上的狭小平台上散步，抽着玛蒂尔德命人去荷兰弄来的上好雪茄，根本没想到城里所有的望远镜每天都等待着他的出现。他的心思在韦尔吉。他从不跟富凯谈德·莱纳夫人，但是他这位朋友有两、三次对他说，她恢复得很快，这句话在他的心中回荡不已。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While Julien's spirit was almost always  completely lost in the world of ideas, Mathilde, occupied with realities, as  becomes an aristocratic heart,had contrived to increase the intimacy of the  direct correspondence between Madame de Fervaques and M. de Frilair to such a  point that already the mighty word Bishopric had been uttered.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正当于连的灵魂几乎无时不沉浸在思想的国度之时，玛蒂尔德则忙于实际事务，这对一颗贵族的心来说倒也合适，她已能把德·费瓦克夫人和德·福利莱先生之间的联络推进到这样一种亲密程度，主教职位这个关键的词已被提出。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The venerable prelate, in whose hands was  the list of benefices, added as a postscript to one of his niece's letters:  'That poor Sorel is nothing worse than a fool, I hope that he will be restored  to us.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>掌管圣职分配的可敬的高级教士，在他侄女的一封信上作为附注添了一句：“这个可怜的索莱尔不过是个冒失鬼，我希望能把他还给我们。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At the sight of these lines, M. de Frilair  was almost out of his mind. He had no doubt of his ability to save Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看见这几行字，德·福利莱先生欣喜若狂，他不怀疑能救出于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But for that Jacobinical law which  prescribes the registration of an endless list of jurors, and has no other real  object than to take away all influence from wellborn people,' he said to  Mathilde, on the eve of the drawing by lot of the thirty-six jurors for the  assize, 'I could have answered for the verdict. Did I not secure the acquittal  of the cure N—— ?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要不是这种雅各宾党人的法律规定要有一份长长的陪审官的名单，其真正目的不过是剥夺出身好的人的势力罢了，”在抽签决定此次开庭的三十六名陪审官的前一天，他对玛蒂尔德说，“我本可以左右判决，本堂神布Ｎ…就是我让人宣告无罪的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It was with pleasure that, on the following  day, among the names drawn from the urn, M. de Frilair found those of five  members of the Congregation of Besancon, and, among those who were strangers to  the town, the names of MM. Valenod, de Moirod and de Cholin. 'I can answer at  once for these eight jurors,' he told Mathilde. 'The first five are machines.  Valenod is my agent, Moirod owes all he has to me, Cholin is an imbecile, who  is afraid of everything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天，在从票箱里出来的人名中，德·福利如先生高兴地发现有五个贝商秘的圣会分子，并且在非本城的人名中，有瓦勒诺、德·莫瓦罗先生、德·肖兰先生。“我首先可以保证这八位陪审官，”他对玛蒂尔德说，“头五个是机器。瓦勒诺是我的代理人，莫瓦罗全靠着我，德·肖兰则是个胆小怕事的笨蛋。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The newspaper published throughout the  Department the names of the jurors, and Madame de Renal, to the inexpressible  terror of her husband, decided to come to Besancon. All that M. de Renal could  obtain from her was that she would not leave her bed, so that she might not be exposed  to the nuisance of being summoned to give evidence. 'You do not understand my  position,' said the former Mayor of Verrieres. 'I am now a Liberal of the  defection, as they call it; no doubt but that rascal Valenod and M. de Frilair  will easily persuade the Attorney General and the Judges to anything that can  be unpleasant for me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>报纸将陪审官的名字传遍全省，德·莱纳夫人想去贝藏松，她丈夫不禁惊恐万状。德·莱纳先生能够得到的，只是她答应绝不下床，免得被传出庭作证而心中不快。“您了解我的处境，”维里埃的前市长说，“我现在进了变节的自由党人了，像他们说的；毫无疑问，瓦勒诺这混蛋和德·福利莱先生很容易让检察长和法官们做出可能令我不快的事情来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal yielded without protest to  her husband's orders, '?f I were to appear at the Assize Court,' she told  herself, 'I should seem to be demanding vengeance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·莱纳夫人毫无困难地服从了丈夫的命令。“如果我在法庭上露面，”她想，“就好像我要求报复似的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Notwithstanding all the promises of prudence  made to her spiritual director and to her husband, no sooner had she arrived in  Besancon than she wrote with her own hand to each of the thirty-six jurors:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管她对她的忏悔神甫和她丈夫作出种种许诺，她还是一到贝藏松就给三十六位陪审官每人写了一封亲笔信：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I shall not appear in Court upon the day of  the trial, Sir, because my presence might prejudice M. Sorel's case. I desire  but one thing in the world, and that passionately, namely his acquittal. Be  assured of this, the terrible thought that on my account an innocent man has  been sent to his death would poison the remainder of my life, and would  doubtless shorten it. How could you sentence him to death, while I still live?  No,beyond question, society has not the right to take life, especially from such  a man as Julien Sorel. Everyone at Verrieres has seen him in moments of  distraction. This poor young man has powerful enemies; but, even among his  enemies (and how many they are!) who is there that has any doubt of his  admirable talents and his profound learning? It is not an ordinary person that  you are about to judge, Sir. For nearly eighteen months we have all known him  to be pious, wise, studious; but, two or three times in the year, he was seized  by fits of melancholy which bordered on insanity. The whole town of Verrieres,  all our neighbours at Vergy where we go in the fine weather, all my family, the  Sub-Prefect himself, will bear testimony to his exemplary piety; he knows by  heart the whole of the Holy Bible. Would an unbeliever have applied himself for  years on end to learning the Holy Scriptures? My sons will have the honour to  present this letter to you: they are children. Deign to question them, Sir,  they will furnish you with all the details relative to this poor young man that  may still be necessary to convince you of the barbarity of condemning him. Far  from avenging me, you would be sentencing me to death.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>审判那一天，我绝不露面，先生，因为我的在场会给索莱尔先生的案子造成不利。我在这世上只盼望，而且满怀热情地盼望一件事，那就是他能得救。请您不必怀疑，一个无辜的人因我而被判处死刑，这可怕的念头会败坏我的余生，并且无疑会缩短我的生命。我还活着，您怎么能判他死刑呢？不，毫无疑问，社会丝毫没有权剥夺一个人的生命，特别是像于连·索莱尔这样一个人的生命。在维里埃，谁都知道他有过精神失常的时刻。这可怜的年轻人有一些有权势的的敌人；但是，即便在他的敌人（他有多少啊！）中，有哪一个怀疑他的了不起的才华和渊博的学识？先生，您将审判不是一个凡夫俗子。在将近十八个月的时间里，我们都知道他虔诚，老实，勤奋；不过，每年有两、三次，他的忧郁症发作，甚至导致精神失常。维里埃全城的人，我们度过美好季节的韦尔吉的所有邻居，我的全家，专区区长先生本人，都可证明他的虔诚堪称榜样，他能背出整本《圣经》。一个不信神的人能坚持数年专心研读《圣经》吗？我的儿子们将有幸向您递交这封信，他们是些孩子。请您问问他们，先生，他们会把和这可怜的年轻人有关的详细情况告诉您，为了能使您相信判他死刑是野蛮的，这些情况还是很必要的。您非但不是为我报仇，反而会要我的命。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What is there that his enemies can advance  in rebuttal of the following fact? The injury that ensued from one of those  moments of insanity which my children themselves used to remark in their tutor  was so far from dangerous that within less than two months, it has allowed me  to post from Verrieres to Besancon. If I learn, Sir, that you have even the slightest  hesitation in saving from the barbarity of our laws a person who is so little  guilty, I shall leave my bed, to which I am confined solely by my husband's  orders, and shall come to throw myself at your feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的敌人能拿什么来反对这些事实呢？我的孩子们亲眼见过他们的家庭教师疯狂发作的时刻，我的伤就是此种时刻造成的结果，其危险性如此之小，不到两个月我就能乘驿车从维里埃到贝藏松来了。如果我知道，先生，您还对把一个犯罪如此轻微的人从法律的野蛮下解脱出来有片刻的犹豫，我将离开只有我丈夫的命今才能让我躺卧的病床，跪倒在您的脚下。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Declare, Sir, that the premeditation is not  proven, and you will not have to reproach yourself with the blood of an  innocent man,' etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请您宣布，先生，预谋是不确实的，那么，您将不会因为让无辜者流血而自责……”   </p>
