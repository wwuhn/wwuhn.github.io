  <div class="left"><p>He  heard a great din in the corridor; it was not the hour for visiting his cell;  the osprey flew away screaming, the door opened, and the venerable cure Chelan,  trembling all over and leaning upon his cane, flung himself into Julien's arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他听见走廊里有重大的响动、平常这个时候不会有人到他的牢房里来；白尾海雕边叫着一边飞走，门开了，可敬的谢朗神甫，颤颤巍巍，手拄着拐杖，一下子扑到他的怀里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  great God! Is it possible, my child… Monster, I ought to say.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！伟大的天主，这可能吗，我的孩子……我应该叫你恶魔呀！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  the good old man could not add another word. Julien was afraid of his falling.  He was obliged to lead him to a chair. The hand of time had fallen heavily upon  this man, so vigorous in days gone by. He appeared to Julien to be only the  ghost of his former self.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>善良的老人再多一句活也说不出来了。于连怕他跌倒，不得不扶他坐在椅子上。时间的手己经重重地压在这个从前精力那么充沛的人身上  。于连觉得他不过是个影子罢了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  he had recovered his breath: 'Only the day before yesterday, I received your  letter from Strasbourg, with your five hundred francs for the poor of  Verrieres; it was brought to me up in the mountains at Liveru, where I have  gone to live with my nephew Jean. Yesterday, I learned of the catastrophe… Oh,  heavens! Is it possible?' The old man's tears ceased to flow, he seemed  incapable of thought and added mechanically: 'You will need your five hundred francs,  I have brought them back to you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他缓过气来、说道：“前天我才收到您从斯特拉斯堡写来的信，还有送给维里埃的穷人的五百法郎，他们给我送到了山里的利弗吕村，我退休后住在那里，在我侄子让的家里。昨天我听说您闯了大祸……天哪！这可能吗！”老人不流泪了，好像也没有思想了，只是机械地补充道，“您会需要您那五百法郎的，我给您带来了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  need to see you, Father!' Julien exclaimed with emotion. 'I have plenty of  money.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我需要看见您，我的父亲！”于连叫道，深受感动，“我还有钱。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  he could not extract any coherent answer. From time to time, M.Chelan shed a  few tears which rolled in silence down his cheeks; then he gazed at Julien, and  was almost stupefied at seeing him take his hands and raise them to his lips.  That countenance, once so lively, and so vigorous in its expression of the  noblest sentiments, was no longer to be aroused from a state of apathy. A sort  of peasant came presently to fetch the old man. 'It does not do to tire him,'  he said to Julien, who realised that this was the nephew. This visit left  Julien plunged in bitter grief which stopped his tears. Everything seemed to  him sad and comfortless;he felt his heart freeze in his bosom.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而他再得不到有条理的回答了，谢朗先生不时地有几滴眼泪顺着面颊静静地流下；然后他望着于连。看见他拉起自己的手亲吻，好像很  茫然似的，这张脸过去是那么生动，那么有力地流露出最高贵的感情，而现在却是一片麻木迟钝。很快，一个农民样的人来接老人。“别让他太累了，”他对于连说，于连知道这就是那侄子了。这次见面使于连沉入一种残酷的不幸之中，眼泪也不流了。他觉得一切都是悲惨的，无可慰藉的；他觉得他的心在胸膛里冻住了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was the most cruel moment that he had experienced since the crime. He had seen  death face to face, and in all its ugliness. All the illusions of greatness of  soul and generosity had been scattered like a cloud before the storm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这是他犯罪以来感受到的最残酷的时刻。他刚刚看见了死亡，而且看见了它全部的丑。灵魂的伟大，胸怀的宽阔。所有这些幻想都在倾刻间消散，仿佛暴风雨前的一片云。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  fearful situation lasted for some hours. After moral poisoning,one requires  physical remedies and a bottle of champagne. Julien would have deemed himself a  coward had he had recourse to them. Towards the end of a horrible day, the  whole of which he had spent in pacing the floor of his narrow dungeon: 'What a  fool I am!' he exclaimed. 'It would be if I expected to die in my bed that the  sight of that poor old man ought to make me so utterly wretched; but a swift  death in the springtide of life is the very thing to save me from that  miserable decrepitude.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种可怕的状况持续了好几个钟头。精神中毒以后，需要在肉体上予以补救，需要喝香槟酒。于连觉得那是怯懦的表现。一整天他都在狭窄的主塔楼里走来走去，到了这可怕的一天快结束的时候，他突然叫道：“我多傻！看到这可怜的老人让我感到可怕的悲哀，那是在我应该像别人一样地死去的情况下呀；然而风华正茂之际迅速死去正好让我避开了风烛残年的悲惨景象。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Whatever  arguments he might thus advance, Julien found that he was moved like any  pusillanimous creature and made wretched in consequence by this visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>无论怎么想，于连还是动了感情，像一个懦弱的人一样，因此这次探访使他感到难过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  was no longer any trace of rugged grandeur in him, any Roman virtue; death  appeared to him on a higher plane, and as a thing less easily to be won.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在他身上没有什么严厉和崇高了，也没有古罗马人的刚毅了；死亡的高度似乎升高了，好像是一件不那么容易的事了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  shall be my thermometer,' he said to himself. This evening I am ten degrees  below the level of courage that must lead me to the guillotine. This morning, I  had that courage. What does it matter, after all?Provided  that it returns to me at the right moment.' This idea of a thermometer amused  him and succeeded finally in distracting him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就是我的温度计，”他心想。“今晚，我在登上断头台所需的勇气以下十度，今天早晨，这勇气我还有。不过，有什么关系！必要的  时候升上去就行了。”温度计的想法使他很开心，终于化解了他的心事。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  morning, on waking, he was ashamed of his behaviour the day before. 'My  happiness, my tranquillity are at stake.' He almost made up his mind to write  to the Attorney-General to ask that nobody should be admitted to his cell. 'And  Fouque?' he thought. 'If he can manage to come to Besancon, how distressed he  will be.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天一觉醒来，他对过去的一天感到羞愧。“事关我的幸福，我的平静。”他差一点给总检察长写信，要求他不准任何人来看他。“那富凯呢？”他想。“要是他执意来巴藏松，看不到我他会多痛苦啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was perhaps two months since he had given Fouque a thought. 'I was an utter  fool at Strasbourg, my thoughts never went beyond my coat collar.' Memories of  Fouque kept recurring to his mind and left him in a more tender mood. He paced  the floor with agitation. 'Now I am certainly twenty degrees below the level of  death … If this weakness increases, it will pay me better to kill myself. What  a joy for the abbe Maslons and the Valenods if I die here like a rat!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>也许有两个月他没有想到富凯了。“我在斯特拉斯堡时是个大傻瓜，我的思想都没有远过我的衣领。”他百般思念富凯，越想心越软。他不安地走来走去。“我现在肯定是在死亡的水平以下二十度了……如果这种软弱越来越严重，最好还是自杀。我若是像个奴才那样死去，马斯隆神甫和瓦勒诺之流该多高兴啊！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fouque  arrived; the simple, honest fellow was shattered by grief. His sole idea, if he  had one at all, was to sell all that he possessed in order to corrupt the  gaoler and so save Julien's life. He spoke to him for hours of the escape of M.  de Lavalette.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>富凯来了，这个淳朴而善良的人痛苦得要发狂了。他只有一个主意，如果他还有主意的话，那就是变卖家产引诱看守，让于连逃走。他详详细细地跟他谈德·拉瓦莱特先生的越狱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p> 'You  distress me,' Julien said to him; 'M. de Lavalette was innocent, I am guilty.  Without meaning to do so, you make me realise the difference…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你让我感到难过，”于连对他说，“德·拉瓦莱特先生是无辜的，我却是有罪的；你是无意，却让我想到了区别……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  is it true? What! You would sell all that you have?' said Julien,suddenly  becoming observant and suspicious once more.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过，这是真的吗！怎么？你要变卖全部财产？”于连说，突然间又变得狐疑和喜欢观察了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fouque,  delighted to see his friend at last responsive to his dominant idea, explained  to him in full detail, and to within a hundred francs or so, what he expected  to receive for each of his properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>富凯看到他的朋友终于对他这个压倒一切的主意有了反应，非常高兴，就详详细细地把每项产业能得到的钱一一算给他听，连百把法郎都  算上了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a sublime effort in a small landowner!' thought Julien. 'How many savings, how  many little cheeseparings, which made me blush so when I saw him make them, he  is willing to sacrifice for me! None of those fine young fellows whom I used to  see at the Hotel de La Mole,who read Rene, would have any of his absurdities; but  apart from those of them who are very young and have inherited fortunes, as  well, and know nothing of the value of money, which of those fine Parisians  would be capable of such a sacrifice?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这对一个乡下业主是多么崇高的努力啊！”于连想。“多少次节省，多少次斤斤计较的吝啬，我过去看了觉得那么脸红，而今他却全都为我牺牲了！我在德·拉莫尔府看见的那些漂亮的年轻人，他们读《勒内》，却没有一个会有这种可笑之举；除了那些还很年轻的、还可因遗产而致富的人之外，他们并不知道金钱的价值，这些漂亮的巴黎人中有哪一个能做出这样的牺牲呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>All  Fouque's mistakes in grammer, all his vulgar mannerisms vanished, he flung  himself into his arms. Never have the provinces, when contrasted with Paris,  received a nobler homage. Fouque, delighted by the enthusiasm which he read in  his friend's eyes, mistook it for consent to an escape.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>富凯的所有语法上的错误，所有粗俗的举止，顷刻间消失，于连投入了他的怀抱。比诸巴黎，外省人从未受过如此崇高的敬意。富凯在朋友的眼中看到他有了热情，十分高兴，还以为他同意逃走了呢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  glimpse of the sublime restored to Julien all the strength of which M. Chelan's  visit had robbed him. He was still very young; but, to my mind, he was a fine  plant. Instead of his advancing from tenderness to cunning, like the majority  of men, age would have given him an easy access to emotion, he would have been  cured of an insane distrust … But what good is there in these vain predictions?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>目睹崇高，使于连又恢复了因谢朗先生的出现而消失的全部力量。他还很年轻，依我看，这是一棵好苗子。他不曾像大多数人那样从温和走向狡猾，年龄反而给了他易受感动的仁爱之心，那种过分的孤疑也会得到疗治……然而这些空洞的预言又有何用？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  examinations became more frequent, in spite of the efforts of Julien, whose  answers were all aimed at cutting the whole business short. 'I have taken life,  or at least I have sought to take life, and with premeditation,' he repeated  day after day. But the magistrate was a formalist first and foremost. Julien's  statements in no way cut short the examinations;the magistrate's feelings were  hurt. Julien did not know that they had proposed to remove him to a horrible  cellar, and that it was thanks to Fouque's intervention that he was allowed to  remain in his charming room one hundred and eighty steps from the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管于连做出种种努力，审讯还是比过去频繁了，他的所有回答都以简化事态为目的：“我杀了人，至少我是想致人死命，而且有预谋，”每次他都这样说。然而法官首先看重形式。于连的申明非但没有缩短审讯，反而伤了法官的自尊心。他不知道他们想把他转到可怕的地牢里，亏了富凯的活动，他们才让他呆在一百八十阶之上的漂亮房间里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  l'abbe de Frilair was one of the important persons who contracted with Fouque  for the supply of their firewood. The honest merchant had access even to the  allpowerful Vicar-General. To his inexpressible delight, M. de Frilair informed  him that, touched by the good qualities of Julien and by the services which he  had rendered in the past to the Seminary, he intended to intervene on his  behalf with the judges. Fouque saw a hope of saving his friend, and on leaving  his presence, bowing to the ground, begged the Vicar-General to expend upon  masses, to pray for the acquittal of the prisoner, a sum of ten louis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>富凯为一些重要人物供应木柴，德·福利莱神甫就是其中之一。善良的木柴商一直找到了这位权力极大的代理主教。他真是喜出望外，德·福利莱先生对他说，于连的优良品质和过去在神学院的服务，都使他深受感动，他打算在法官面前为他美言几句。富凯看到了拯救朋友的一线希望，走的时候匍匐在地，求代理主教在弥撒上布施十个路易，祈求宣布被告无罪。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fouque  was strangely in error. M. de Frilair was by no means a Valenod. He refused,  and even tried to make the worthy peasant understand that he would do better to  keep his money in his pocket. Seeing that it was impossible to make his meaning  clear without indiscretion, he advised him to distribute the sum in alms, for  the poor prisoners, who, as a matter of fact, were in need of everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>富凯是大错特错了。德·福利莱先生绝非瓦勒诺之流。他拒绝了，甚至力图让这位善良的农民明白，他最好把他的钱留着。他看到不可能既谨慎又能把事情说清楚，就劝他把这笔钱施舍给可怜的囚犯，他们实际上什么都缺。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  Julien is a strange creature, his action is inexplicable,' thought M.de  Frilair, 'and nothing ought to be inexplicable to me… Perhaps it will be  possible to make a martyr of him … In any case, I shall get to the true  inwardness of this business and may perhaps find an opportunity of inspiring  fear in that Madame de Renal, who has no respect for us, and detests me in her  heart… Perhaps I may even discover in all this some sensational means of  reconciliation with M. de La Mole, who has a weakness for this little  Seminarist.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个于连是个怪人，他的行动无法解释，”德·福利莱先生想，“可是对我来说不该有什么不可解释的事……也许有可能使他成为一个殉教者……无论如何，我会知道事情的底细的，也许还能找到个机会吓唬吓唬那位德·莱纳夫人，她丝毫不尊重我们，心里还恨我……也许我还能在这一切中找到一种办法跟德·拉莫尔先生取得为我增光的和解，他似乎挺偏爱这个小修士。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  settlement of the lawsuit had been signed some weeks earlier, and the abbe  Pirard had left Besancon, not without having spoken of the mystery of Julien's  birth, on the very day on which the wretched fellow tried to kill Madame de  Renal in the church of Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>诉讼案的和解已在几个星期前签字了，彼拉神甫离开贝藏松时，不是没谈过于连的神秘出身，就在那一天，这不幸的人在维里埃的教堂里朝德·莱纳夫人开了枪。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  saw only one disagreeable incident in store for him before his death, namely a  visit from his father. He consulted Fouque as to his idea of writing to the  Attorney-General, asking to be excused any further visitors. This horror at the  sight of a father, at such a moment, shocked the honest and respectable heart  of the timber-merchant profoundly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连在他和死亡之间只看见一件讨厌的事情，就是他父亲的探访。他想写信给总捡察长要求禁止一切探望，他就此征求富凯的意见。讨厌看见父亲，而且还是在这样的时候，这位木材商那颗正直的、市民的心深感不快。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  thought he understood why so many people felt a passionate hatred of his  friend. Out of respect for another's grief, he concealed his feelings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他觉得明白了为什么那么多的人恨死了他的朋友。出于对不幸的尊重，他藏起了他的感情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  any case,' he replied coldly, 'an order for solitary confinement would not  apply to your father.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“无论如何，”他冷冷地说，“这道密令不该用在你父亲身上。”<br />
