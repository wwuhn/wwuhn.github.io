<p>For  I saw everything that I am telling you; and if I may have been deceived when I  saw it, I am most certainly not deceiving you in telling you of it.</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>The  Marquis sent for him; M. de La Mole seemed rejuvenated, there was a gleam in  his eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>侯爵打发人来叫他；德·拉莫尔先生似乎年轻了，两眼闪闪发光。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let  us hear a little about your memory,' he said to Julien. 'I am told it is  prodigious! Could you learn four pages by heart and go and repeat them in  London? But without altering a word!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“咱们来谈谈您的记忆力吧，”他对于连说，“据说神乎其神！您能记住四页东西再到伦敦背出来吗？但是要一字不差！……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis was feverishly turning the pages of that morning's Quotidienne, and  seeking in vain to dissimulate a highly serious air, which Julien had never  seen him display, not even when they were discussing the Frilair case.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵悻悻地揉搓着当天的《每日新闻》，试图掩饰他那极为严肃的神情，但是徒劳。于连从未见过侯爵这样严肃，就是谈到福利莱诉讼案时也不曾见过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had by this time sufficient experience to feel that he ought to appear  thoroughly deceived by the light manner that was being assumed for his benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
于连已经有了经验，感觉到了他得装作完全被那种轻松口吻骗过。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  number of the Quotidienne is perhaps not very amusing; but, if M. le Marquis  will allow me, tomorrow morning I shall have the honour to recite it to him  from beginning to end.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这一期《每日新闻》也许不太有意思，如果侯爵先生允许，明天早晨我将荣幸地全部为先生背出来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  Even the advertisements?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么！包括广告？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Literally,  and without missing a word.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“完全正确，一字不拉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you give me your word for that?' went on the Marquis with a sudden gravity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说话算话？”侯爵说，突然严肃起来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Sir, only the fear of not keeping it might upset my memory.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，先生，只有对于食言的恐惧才能干扰我的记忆力。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  I mean is that I forgot to ask you this question yesterday; I do not ask you on  your oath never to repeat what you are about to hear; I know you too well to  insult you in that way. I have answered for you, I am going to take you to a  room where there will be twelve persons assembled; you will take note of what  each of them says.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“所以我昨天忘了跟您谈到这个问题，我不要求您发誓永远不把您将听见的东西说出去，我是太了解您了，不想让您蒙受这种侮辱。我替您做了担保，我要带您去一间客厅，将有十二个人在那儿聚会，您把每个人说的话记录下来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  not be uneasy, it is not going to be a confused conversation, each one will  speak in his turn, I do not mean a set speech,' the Marquis went on, resuming  the tone of careless superiority which came so naturally to him. 'While we are  talking, you will write down twenty pages or so; you will return here with me,  we shall cut down those twenty pages to four.It  is those four pages that you shall recite to me tomorrow morning instead of the  whole number of the Quotidienne. You will then set off at once; you will have  to take post like a young man who is travelling for his pleasure. Your object  will be to pass unobserved by anyone. You will arrive in the presence of a  great personage. There, you will require more skill. It will be a question of  taking in everyone round him; for among his secretaries, among his servants, there  are men in the pay of our enemies, who lie in wait for our agents to intercept  them. You shall have a formal letter of introduction. When His Excellency looks  at you, you will take out my watch here, which I am going to lend you for the  journey. Take it now, while you are about it, and give me yours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您不必担心，那绝不是乱哄哄的谈话，大家轮流发言，当然我不是说有先后次序，”侯爵恢复了常态，神色狡黠而轻松。“我们说，您记，会有二十来页吧；然后我们回到这里来，把二十页压缩成四页。您明天早晨向我背的就是这四页，不是那一期《每日新闻》。然后您立即出发，要像个为了消遣而出门的年轻人那样赶路。目的是不为人注意。您去见一个大人物。到了那儿，您可得更机灵些了。要把他周围的人都瞒过，因为他那些秘书、仆人中有投敌的人，他们沿途守候并截住我们的使者。您随身带一封无关紧要的介绍信。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  Duke himself will condescend to copy out at your dictation the four pages which  you will have learned by heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“阁下看您的时候，您把我这只表拿出来，就是这只，我借给您路上用。您拿去带在身上，现在就换过来吧，把您的表给我。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'When  this has been done, but not before, remember, you may, if His Excellency  questions you, give him an account of the meeting which you are now about to  attend.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“公爵会在您的口授下，亲自记下您牢记在心的那四页东西。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  thing that will prevent you from feeling bored on your jorney is that between  Paris and the residence of the Minister there are people who would ask for  nothing better than to fire a shot at M. l'abbe Sorel.Then  his mission is at an end and I foresee a long delay; for, my dear fellow, how  shall we hear of your death? Your zeal cannot go so far as to inform us of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然后，千万注意，不是在此之前，如果阁下问您，您就把会议情况讲给他听。“您路上不会寂寞的，在巴黎和这位大臣的住所之间，有人巴不得朝索莱尔神甫打上一枪。这样一来他的使命便告结束，我看事情也就被大大地耽搁了，因为，我亲爱的，我们如何能知道您死了呢？您的热情总不至于能把您的死讯通知我们吧。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Run  off at once and buy yourself a complete outfit,' the Marquis went on with a  serious air. 'Dress in the style of the year before last. This evening you will  have to look a little shabby. On the journey, however, you will dress as usual.  Does that surprise you, does your suspicious mind guess the reason? Yes, my  friend, one of the venerable personages whom you are about to hear discuss is  fully capable of transmitting information by means of which someone may quite  possibly administer opium to you, if nothing worse, in the evening, in some  respectable inn at which you will have called for supper.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“立即去买一套衣服，”侯爵严肃地说，“按照两年前的式样穿戴起来。今天晚上您得拿出点不修边幅的样子。而在路上，您要像平时一样。您感到奇怪吗？您疑心到什么了吗？是的，我的朋友，您听到发言的那些可敬的人物中间，很可能有一位把情报送出去，根据这些情报，他们就会在您吃晚饭的那家好客店里至少给您来点儿鸦片。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  would be better,' said Julien, 'to travel thirty leagues farther and avoid the  direct route. My destination is Rome, I suppose… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“最好是绕道多走上三十里，”于连说，“我想是去罗马……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis assumed an air of haughty displeasure which Julien had not seen to so marked  a degree since Brayle Haut.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>候爵显出高傲和不满的神色，自博莱—勒欧以来，于连还未见过侯爵这样。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is what you shall learn, Sir, when I think fit to tell you. I do not like  questions.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我认为合适的时候会告诉您，先生，您会知道的，我不喜欢别人多问。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  was not a question,' replied Julien effusively: 'I swear to you, Sir, I was  thinking aloud, I was seeking in my own mind the safest route.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不是问，先生，我发誓，”于连情不自禁地说，“我想着想着就出了声，我是在心里找一条最稳妥的路。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  it seems that your thoughts were far away. Never forget that an ambassador, one  of your youth especially, ought not to appear to be forcing confidences.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是啊，看来您的心走得很远。永远不要忘记，一个使臣，而且还是您这个年纪的使臣，不应该有一种勉强可以信任的样子。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was greatly mortified, he was in the wrong. His self-esteem sought for an  excuse and could find none.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连深感屈辱，是他错了。他为了自尊心想找个借口，可是没有找到。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Understand  then,' M. de La Mole went on, 'that people always appeal to their hearts when  they have done something foolish.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“所以您要明白，”德·拉莫尔先生又说，“一个人干了蠢事，总是推说是出于好心。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  hour later, Julien was in the Marquis's waiting-room in the garb of an  inferior, with old-fashioned clothes, a doubtfully clean neck-cloth and  something distinctly smug about his whole appearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个钟头之后，于连来到侯爵的前厅，一副下属模样，旧时的衣服，白领带不白，整个外表透着几分学究气。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  the sight of him, the Marquis burst out laughing, and then only was Julien's  apology accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵看见他，不禁哈哈大笑，只是这时，他才完全觉得于连足堪信任。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  this young man betrays me,' M. de La Mole asked himself, 'whom can I trust? And  yet when it comes to action, one has to trust somebody.My  son and his brilliant friends of the same kidney have honest hearts, and  loyalty enough for a hundred thousand; if it were a question of fighting, they  would perish on the steps of the throne, they know everything… except just what  is required at the moment. Devil take me if I can think of one of them who  could learn four pages by heart and travel a hundred leagues without being  tracked. Norbert would know how to let himself be killed like his ancestors,  but any conscript can do that… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
“如果这个年轻人出卖我，”德·拉莫尔先生心想，“那还相信谁呢？然而，只要行动，总得相信什么人。我的儿子和他那些同类的杰出朋友，他们勇敢、忠诚，抵得上他人十万；如果要打仗，他们会战死在王座前的台阶上，他们什么都会……除了眼下需要干的这件事。如果我看见他们中间哪一位能记住四大页，跑一百里路不被发觉，那才见鬼呢。诺贝尔可以像他的先人一样不怕死，这也是一个新兵能做到的……”
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis fell into a profound meditation: 'And even being killed,' he said with  a sigh, 'perhaps this Sorel would manage that as well as he …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵陷入沉思：“就说不怕死吧，”他叹了口气，“这个索莱尔也许不比他差……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  carriage is waiting,' said the Marquis, as though to banish a vexatious  thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“上车吧，”侯爵说，像显要赶走一个烦人的念头。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,'  said Julien, 'while they were altering this coat for me, I committed to memory  the first page of today's Quotidienne.'The  Marquis took the paper, Julien repeated the page without a single mistake. 'Good,'  said the Marquis, every inch the diplomat that evening; 'meanwhile this young  man is not observing the streets through which we are passing.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，”于连说，“在人家替我准备这身衣服的时候，我已记住了今天的《每日新闻》的第一版。”侯爵拿起报纸，于连倒背如流，一字不差。“好，”侯爵说，今天晚上他很像个外交家，“这段时间里，这年轻人不会注意我们经过的街道。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>They  arrived in a large room of a distinctly gloomy aspect, partly panelled and  partly hung in green velvet. In the middle of the room, a scowling footman had  just set up a large dinner-table, which he proceeded to convert into a writing  table, by means of an immense green cloth covered with ink stains, a relic of  some Ministry.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们走进一间外表相当阴沉的大厅，墙上部分装有护壁板，部分张着绿色天鹅绒。大厅中间，一个仆人沉着脸，摆好一张大餐桌，又铺上一块绿台布，把它变成一张会议桌。绿台布上墨迹斑驳，不知是从哪个部里拣来的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  master of the house was a corpulent man whose name was never uttered; Julien  decided that his expression and speech were those of a man engaged in  digestion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>房主人是个庞然大物，姓名不见提起；从相貌和口才看，于连觉得他是个很有城府的人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  a sign from the Marquis, Julien had remained at the lower end of the table. To  avoid drawing attention to himself he began to point the quills. He counted out  of the corner of his eye seven speakers, but he could see nothing more of them  than their backs. Two of them appeared to him to be addressing M. de La Mole on  terms of equality, the others seemed more or less deferential.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在侯爵的示意下，于连呆在桌子的下方。为了定一定神，他开始削羽毛笔。他用眼角数了数，有七个人说话，但是他只能看见他们的后背。他觉得，有两位跟德·拉莫尔先生说话口气是平等的，其余几位就多少有些恭敬了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Another  person entered the room unannounced. 'This is strange,' thought Julien, 'no one  is announced in this room. Can this precaution have been taken in my honour?'  Everyone rose to receive the newcomer.He  was wearing the same extremely distinguished decoration as three of the men who  were already in the room. They spoke in low tones. In judging the newcomer,  Julien was restricted to what he could learn from his features and dress. He  was short and stout, with a high complexion and a gleaming eye devoid of any  expression beyond the savage glare of a wild boar.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>又来了一位，未经通报。“这可怪了，”于连想，“这间客厅里是不通报的。难道这种防范是因为我吗？”众人都起身迎接新来的人。他佩带着和客厅里的三个人相同的级别很高的勋章。他们说话的声音相当低。于连只能根据相貌和仪表来判断这个新来的人。他长得矮小粗壮，红光满面，两眼发亮，除了野猪的凶狠外没有别的表情。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  attention was sharply distracted by the almost immediate arrival of a wholly  different person. This was a tall man, extremely thin and wearing three or four  waistcoats. His eye was caressing, his gestures polished.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>紧随其后的是一个完全不同的人。一下子紧紧地吸引了于连的注意力。这个人很高很瘦，穿着三、四件背心。他的目光和蔼，举止彬彬有礼。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is just the expression of the old Bishop of Besancon,' thought Julien. This man  evidently belonged to the Church, he did not appear to be more than fifty or  fifty-five, no one could have looked more fatherly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这完全是贝藏松的老主教的模样啊，”于连想。这个人显然是教会方面的，看上去不会超过五十岁到五十五岁，神情再慈祥不过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  young Bishop of Agde appeared, and seemed greatly surprised when, in making a  survey of those present, his eye rested on Julien. He had not spoken to him  since the ceremony at Brayle Haut. His look of surprise embarrassed and  irritated Julien. 'What,' the latter said to himself, 'is knowing a man to be  always to my disadvantage? All these great gentlemen whom I have never seen  before do not frighten me in the least, and the look in this young Bishop's  eyes freezes me! It must be admitted that I am a very strange and very  unfortunate creature.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>年轻的阿格德主教来了，他环顾在场的人，目光到了于连身上，不禁大大地一愣。自博莱－勒欧的瞻仰仪式以来，他还没有跟于连说过话。他那惊讶的目光让于连好不自在，不由得一阵火起。“怎么了：“于连心想，“认识一个人老是让我倒霉吗？这些大人我从未见过，可我一点儿也不害怕，这年轻主教的目光却让我不知所措！应该承认，我这个人很怪，很倒霉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  small and extremely dark man presently made a noisy entrance, and began? speaking from the door; he had a sallow  complexion and a slightly eccentric air. On the arrival of this pitiless  talker, groups began to form, apparently to escape the boredom of listening to  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>很快，一个头发极黑的小个子风风火火地进来了，进门就说话；他面皮发黄，神色疯疯癫癫的。这个不管不顾的话匣子一到，在场的人就纷纷聚成团儿了，显然是避免听他饶舌心烦。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  they withdrew from the fireplace they drew near to the lower end of the table,  where Julien was installed. His expression became more and more embarrassed,  for now at last, in spite of all his efforts, he could not avoid hearing them,  and however slight his experience might be, he realised the full importance of  the matters that were being discussed without any attempt at concealment; and  yet how careful the evidently exalted personages whom he saw before him ought  to be to keep them secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他们离开壁炉，走近于连坐着的桌子下方。于连越来越不自在，因为不管他多么努力，他也不能不听见，而且无论他多么没有经验，他也知道他们毫不掩饰地谈论的事情多么重要，他眼前的这些大人物又是多么希望这些事情不为人知！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Already,  working as slowly as possible, Julien had pointed a score of quills; this  resource must soon fail him. He looked in vain for an order in the eyes of M.  de La Mole; the Marquis had forgotten him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连尽可能慢地削，也已经削了二十来只了，这个办法快用到头了。他在德·拉莫尔先生的眼睛里寻求命令，没有用，侯爵已把他忘了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  I am doing is absurd,' thought Julien as he pointed his pens; 'but people who  are so commonplace in appearance, and are entrusted by others or by themselves  with such high interests, must be highly susceptible. My unfortunate expression  has a questioning and scarcely respectful effect which would doubtless annoy  them. If I lower my eyes too far I shall appear to be making a record of their  talk.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我在这儿真可笑，”于连心想，一边削着羽毛笔，“然而这些相貌如此平庸的人，别人或他们自己把如此重要的事情委托给他们，该是一些敏感的人。我这倒霉的目光有种询问的意味，不大恭敬，肯定会刺激他们。如果我老是低头不看他们，又好像是搜集他们的言论。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  embarrassment was extreme, he was hearing some strange things said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他窘迫到了极点，他听见了一些奇怪的事情。
</div></div>
