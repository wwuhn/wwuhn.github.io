  <div class="left"><p>When he saw Madame de Renal again, the next morning, there was a strange  look in his eyes; he watched her like an enemy with whom he would presently be  engaged. This expression, so different from his expression overnight, made  Madame de Renal lose her head; she had been kind to him, and he appeared vexed.  She could not take her eyes from his.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天，于连再见到德·莱纳夫人时，目光很古怪；他盯着她，仿佛面前是一个仇敌，他就要与之搏斗。这目光和昨天晚上的多么不同啊，德·莱纳夫人不知所措了：她一向待他很好，可是他好像气鼓鼓地。于是，她也不能不盯着他了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame Derville's presence excused Julien from his share of the  conversation, and enabled him to concentrate his attention upon what he had in  mind. His sole occupation, throughout the day, was that of fortifying himself  by reading the inspired text which refreshed his soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德尔维夫人在场，于连正可少说话，更多地捉摸自己的心事。整个白天，他唯一的事情就是阅读那本有灵感的书，使自己的灵魂再一次得到锤炼，变得坚强。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He greatly curtailed the  children's lessons, and when, later on, the presence of Madame de Renal  recalled him to the service of his own vanity, decided that it was absolutely  essential that this evening she should allow her hand to remain in his.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他早早地放孩子们下了课，接着，德·莱纳夫人来到眼前，这又提醒他必须设法维护自已的荣誉，他下定决心，当晚无论如何要握住她的手，并且留下。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The sun as it set and so brought nearer the decisive moment made Julien's  heart beat with a strange excitement. Night fell. He observed,with a joy that  lifted a huge weight from his breast, that it was very dark.A sky packed with  big clouds, kept in motion by a hot breeze, seemed to forebode a tempest. The  two women continued strolling until a late hour.Everything that they did this  evening seemed strange to Julien. They were enjoying this weather, which, in  certain delicate natures, seems to enhance the pleasure of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>夕阳西下，决定性的时刻临近了，于连的心跳得好怪。入夜，他看出这一夜将是一个漆黑的夜，不由得心中大喜，压在胸口的一块巨石被掀掉了。天空布满大块的云，在热风中移动，预示着一场暴风雨。两个女友散步去了，很晚才回来。这一天晚上，她们俩做的事，件件都让于连觉得奇怪。她们喜欢这样的天气，对某些感觉细腻的人来说，这似乎增加了爱的欢乐。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At last they sat down, Madame de Renal next to Julien, and Madame Derville  on the other side of her friend. Preoccupied with the attempt he must shortly  make, Julien could think of nothing to say. The conversation languished.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大家终于落座，德·莱纳夫人坐在于连旁边，德尔维夫人挨着她的朋友。于连一心想着他要做的事，竟找不出话说。谈话无精打采，了无生气。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Shall I tremble like this and feel as uncomfortable the first time  I have to fight a duel?' Julien wondered; for he had too little confidence  either in himself or in others not to observe the state he was in.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连心想：“难道我会像第一次决斗那样发抖和可怜吗？”他看不清自己的精神状态，对自已和对别人都有太多的猜疑。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In this agonising  uncertainty, any danger would have seemed to him preferable. How often did he  long to see Madame de Renal called by some duty which would oblige her to  return to the house and so leave the garden! The violence of the effort which  Julien had to make to control himself was such that his voice was entirely  altered; presently Madame de Renal's voice became tremulous also,  but Julien never noticed this.The ruthless warfare which his sense of duty was  waging with his natural timidity was too exhausting for him to be in a  condition to observe anything outside himself. The quarter before ten had  sounded from the tower clock, without his having yet ventured on anything.  Julien,ashamed of his cowardice, told himself: 'At the precise moment when ten o'clock  strikes, I shall carry out the intention which, all day long, I have been  promising myself that I would fulfil this evening, or I shall go up to my room  and blow my brains out.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种焦虑真是要命啊，简直无论遭遇什么危险都要好受些。他多少次希望德·莱纳夫人有什么事，不能不回到房里去，离开花园！于连极力克制自己，说话的声音完全变了；很快，德·莱纳夫人的声音也发颤了，然而于连竟浑然不觉。责任向胆怯发起的战斗太令人痛苦了，除了他自己，什么也引不起他的注意。古堡的钟已经敲过九点三刻，他还是不敢有所动作。于连对自己的怯懦感到愤怒，心想：“十点的钟声响过，我就要做我一整天里想在晚上做的事，否则我就回到房间里开枪打碎自己的脑袋。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After a final interval of tension and anxiety, during which the  excess of his emotion carried Julien almost out of his senses, the strokes of  ten sounded from the clock overhead. Each stroke of that fatal bell stirred an echo  in his bosom, causing him almost a physical revulsion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连太激动了，几乎不能自己。终于，他头顶上的钟敲了十点，这等待和焦灼的时刻总算过去了。钟声，要命的钟声，一记记在他的脑中回荡，使得他心惊肉跳。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Finally, while the air was still throbbing with the last stroke of  ten, he put out his hand and took that of Madame de Renal, who at once withdrew  it. Julien, without exactly knowing what he was doing, grasped her hand again.  Although greatly moved himself, he was struck by the icy coldness of the hand  he was clasping; he pressed it with convulsive force; a last attempt was made  to remove it from him, but finally the hand was left in his grasp.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>就在最后一记钟声余音未了之际，他伸出手，一把握住德·莱纳夫人的手，但是她立刻抽了回去。于连此时不知如何是好，重又把那只手握住。虽然他已昏了头，仍不禁吃了一惊，他握住的那只手冰也似的凉；他使劲地握着，手也战战地抖；德·莱纳夫人作了最后一次努力想把手抽回，但那只手还是留下了。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His heart was flooded with joy, not because he loved Madame de  Renal, but because a fearful torment was now at an end. So that Madame Derville  should not notice anything, he felt himself obliged to speak; his voice, now,  was loud and ringing. Madame de Renal's, on the other hand, betrayed such  emotion that her friend thought she must be ill and suggested to her that they  should go indoors. Julien saw the danger: 'If Madame de Renal returns to the drawing-room,  I am going to fall back into the horrible position I have been in all day. I  have not held this hand long enough to be able to reckon it as a definite  conquest.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连的心被幸福的洪流淹没了，不是他爱德·莱纳夫人，而是一次可怕的折磨终于到头了。他想他该说话了，不然德尔维夫人会有所察觉，这时他的声音变得响亮而有力。相反，德·莱纳夫人的声音却藏不住激动。她的女友以为她不舒服，建议她回房去。于连感到了危险：“假如德·莱纳夫人回客厅去，我就又陷入白天的那种可怕的境地了。这只手我握的时间还太短，还不能算是我的一次胜利。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When Madame Derville repeated her suggestion that they should go into  the drawing-room, Julien pressed the hand that lay in his.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正当德尔维夫人再次建议回客厅时，于连用力握了一下那只手。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal, who  was preparing to rise, resumed her seat, saying in a faint tone:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人已经站起来，复又坐下，有气无力地说：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I do, as a matter of fact, feel a little unwell, but the fresh air  is doing me good.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“我是觉得有些不舒服，不过，外面的新鲜空气对我有好处。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>These  words confirmed Julien's happiness, which, at this moment, was extreme: he  talked, forgot to dissimulate, appeared the most charming of men to his two  hearers. And yet there was still a slight want of courage in this eloquence  which had suddenly come to him. He was in a deadly fear lest Madame Derville,  exhausted by the wind which was beginning to rise, and heralded the storm,  might decide to go in by herself to the drawing-room. Then he would be left  alone with Madame de Renal. He had found almost by accident the blind courage  which was sufficient for action; but he felt that it lay beyond his power to  utter the simplest of words to Madame de Renal. However mild her reproaches  might be, he was going to be defeated, and the advantage which he had just  gained wiped out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这些话确认了于连的幸福，此时此刻，他真是幸福到了极点：他口若悬河，忘掉了伪装，两个女友听着，简直觉得他是世间最可爱的男人。然而，这突如其来的雄辩仍嫌有气不足。起风了，暴风雨要来了，于连生怕德尔维夫人受不住而想一个人回客厅。那样的话，他就要和德·莱纳夫人面面相觑，单独在一起了。刚才，他是偶然地凭信一股盲目的勇气才有所行动，而现在他觉得哪怕对她说一句最简单的话也力不能及。无论她的责备多么轻微，他也会一触即溃，刚刚获得的胜利也将化为乌有。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Fortunately for him, this evening, his touching and emphatic  speeches found favour with Madame Derville, who as a rule found him as awkward  as a schoolboy, and by no means amusing. As for Madame de Renal, her hand lying  clasped in Julien's, she had no thought of anything;she was allowing herself to  live. The hours they spent beneath this huge lime, which, local tradition  maintained, had been planted by Charles the Bold, were for her a time of  happiness. She listened with rapture to the moaning of the wind in the thick  foliage of the lime, and the sound of the first few drops that were beginning  to fall upon its lowest leaves. Julien did not notice a detail which would have  greatly reassured him; Madame de Renal, who had been obliged to remove her hand  from his, on rising to help her cousin to pick up a pot of flowers which the  wind had overturned at their feet, had no sooner sat down again than she gave  him back her hand almost without difficulty, and as though it had been an understood  thing between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>幸运的是，这晚他的动人又夸张的议论博得了德尔维夫人的欢心，她先前常常觉得他笨拙得像一个孩子，不大讨人喜欢。至于德·莱纳夫人，手握在于连手里，倒是什么也没想，随波逐流由它去了。在当地传说大胆夏尔手植的这株大椴树下度过的这几个钟头，对她来说，是一段幸福的时光。风在椴树浓密的枝叶间低吟，稀疏的雨点滴滴答答落在最低的叶子上，她听得好开心啊。于连没有注意到一个本可以使他放心的情况：德·菜纳夫人和德尔维夫人脚旁的一只花盆被风掀倒，她不得不抽出手来，起身帮助表姐扶起花盆，可是她刚一坐下，就几乎很自然地把手伸给他，仿佛这已是他们之间的一种默契。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Midnight had long since struck; at length it was time to leave the garden:  the party broke up. Madame de Renal, transported by the joy of being in love,  was so ignorant that she hardly reproached herself at all.Happiness robbed her  of sleep. A sleep like lead carried off Julien, utterly worn out by the battle  that had been raging all day in his heart between timidity and pride.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>午夜的钟声早已响过，终须离开花园，这就是说，要分手了。陶醉于爱之幸福的德·莱纳夫人天真无知，竟没有丝毫的自责。幸福使她失眠了。于连却沉沉睡去，胆怯和骄傲在他心中交战了整整一天，弄得他筋疲力尽。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next morning he was called at five o'clock; and (what would have been  a cruel blow to Madame de Renal had she known of it) he barely gave her a  thought. He had done his duty, and a heroic duty. Filled with joy by this  sentiment, he turned the key in the door of his bedroom and gave himself up  with an entirely new pleasure to reading about the exploits of his hero.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天早晨五点钟，他被人叫醒；他几乎已经把德·莱纳夫人忘了，她若是知道，那对她可是太残酷了。他履行了他的责任，而且是一个英雄的责任。这种感觉使他非常幸福，他把自己反锁在房间里，怀着一种全新的乐趣重温他的英雄的丰功伟绩。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When the luncheon bell sounded, he had forgotten, in reading the  reports of the Grand Army, all the advantages he had won overnight. He said to  himself, in a careless tone, as he went down to the drawing-room:'I must tell  this woman that I love her.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>午餐的铃声响了，他在阅读大军公报的时候已经把昨夜的胜利全部抛在脑后。他下楼朝餐厅走去，用一种轻佻的口吻对自己说：“应该告诉这个女人我爱她。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Instead of that gaze charged with passion which he expected to  meet,he found the stern face of M. de Renal, who, having arrived a couple of hours  earlier from Verrieres, did not conceal his displeasure on finding that Julien  was wasting the whole morning without attending to the children. No sight could  have been so unprepossessing as  that of this self-important man, conscious of a grievance and  confident of his right to let it be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他满以为会遇到一双柔情缱绻的眼睛，不料看见的却是德·莱纳先生的一张严厉的脸。德·莱纳先生两个小时前从维里埃来到，他毫不掩饰对于连的不满，他居然整整一上午扔下孩子不管。当这个有权有势的人不高兴并且认为无须掩饰的时候，他的脸真是再难看不过了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Each of her husband's harsh words pierced Madame de Renal to the heart.  As for Julien, he was so plunged in ecstasy, still so absorbed in the great  events which for the last few hours had been happening before his eyes, that at  first he could barely lower the pitch of his attention to listen to the stern  voice of M. de Renal. At length he answered him, sharply enough:</p>

<p>'I was unwell.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>丈夫的每句刻薄的话，都像针一样刺着德·莱纳夫人的心。可是于连还沉浸在狂喜之中，还在回味刚刚在他眼前发生的持续了数小时的一件件大事，因此一开始他不能令注意力屈尊去听德·莱纳先生的那些伤人的话。最后，他相当生硬地对他说：</p>

<p>“我刚才不舒服。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The tone of this reply would have stung a man far less susceptible than  the Mayor of Verrieres; it occurred to him to reply to Julien with an immediate  dismissal. He was restrained only by the maxim which he had laid down for  himself, never to be too hasty in business matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>既使是一个远非市长先生那么爱发火的人，也会被这回答的口吻激怒。他对于连的回答，就是想立即将他赶出去。不过他忍住了，他想起了自己的座右铭：凡事匆躁。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This young fool,' he soon  reminded himself, 'has made himself a sort of reputation in my house; Valenod  may take him on, or else he will marry Elisa, and, in either case, he can  afford to laugh at me in his heart.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个小笨蛋，”他立刻心想，“他在我家里为自己赢得了声誉，瓦勒诺先生可以把他弄去，或者他会娶爱丽莎，无论哪一种情况，他都会在内心里嘲笑我。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Despite the wisdom of these reflections, M.  de Renal's displeasure found an outlet nevertheless in a succession of coarse  utterances which succeeded in irritating Julien. Madame de Renal was on the  point of subsiding in tears. As soon as the meal was ended, she asked Julien to  give her his arm for their walk; she leaned upon it in a friendly way. To all that  Madame de Renal said to him, Julien could only murmur in reply:</p>

</div>
<div class="right">



<p>德·莱纳先生的考虑固然明智，可是他的不满仍旧爆发出未，一连串的粗话渐渐激怒了于连。德·莱纳夫人的眼里涌上了泪水，就要哭出来。午饭一过，她就请求于连让她挽着胳膊去散步。她亲切地依偎着他。无论德·菜纳夫人说什么，于连都只低声应着：</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>'This is what  rich people are like!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“这就是有钱人啊！”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>M. de Renal kept close beside them; his presence increased Julien's  anger. He noticed suddenly that Madame de Renal was leaning upon his arm in a  marked manner; this action horrified him, he repulsed her violently, freeing  his arm from hers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳先生就走在他们身边，于连一看见他，火就不打一处来。他突然感觉到德·莱纳夫人紧紧地靠在他的胳膊上，这个动作使他感到厌恶，他粗暴地推开她，把胳膊抽回来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Fortunately M. de Renal saw nothing of this fresh impertinence; it  was noticed only by Madame Derville; her friend burst into tears. At this  moment M. de Renal began flinging stones at a little peasant girl who was trespassing  by taking a short cut across a corner of the orchard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>幸亏德·莱纳先生没有看见这一新的无礼举动，可是德尔维夫人看见了。她的朋友的眼泪扑簌簌流出来了。这时，德·莱纳先生正用石块驱赶一农家女孩，那女孩抄了一条小路，正穿越果园的一角。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monsieur Julien, kindly control yourself, remember that we are all  of us liable to moments of ill temper,' Madame Derville said hastily.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“于连先生，我求求您，克制一下吧；您应该想想，我们人人都有发脾气的时候。”德尔维夫人很快地说道。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien looked at her coldly with eyes in which the loftiest contempt  was portrayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连冷冷地看了她一眼，目光中流露出极端的轻蔑。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This look astonished Madame Derville, and would have surprised her far  more could she have guessed its full meaning; she would have read in it a vague  hope of the most terrible revenge. It is doubtless to such moments of  humiliation that we owe men like Robespierre.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德尔维夫人大吃一惊，如果她猜得出这目光的真正含义，她还要更吃惊呢；她本来应该看出这目光中闪烁着一种进行最残忍报复的朦胧希望。大概正是此类屈辱的时刻造就了那些罗伯斯庇尔吧。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Your Julien is very violent, he frightens me,' Madame Derville  murmured to her friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您的于连很粗暴，我真害怕，”德尔维夫人向她的朋友低声说。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He has every reason to be angry,' the other replied. 'After the  astonishing progress the children have made with him, what does it matter if he  spends a morning without speaking to them? You must admit that gentlemen are  very hard.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“他有理由发火，”她的朋友回答说，“他使孩子们取得了进步，一个早上不给他们上课有什么关系；我看男人都是很无情的。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For the first time in her life, Madame de Renal felt a sort of  desire to be avenged on her husband. The intense hatred that animated Julien  against rich people was about to break forth. Fortunately M. de Renal called  for his gardener, with whom for the rest of the time he busied himself in stopping  up with faggots of thorn the shortcut that had been made across the orchard.  Julien did not utter a single word in reply to the attentions that were shown  him throughout the remainder of the walk. As soon as M. de Renal had left them,  the two ladies, on the plea that they were tired, had asked him each for an  arm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·菜纳夫人生平第一次感到一种欲望，要对她的丈夫报复。于连对有钱人的极端仇恨也快爆发了。幸好这时德·莱纳先生唤来园丁，跟他一起忙着用一捆捆荆棘堵住穿越果园的那条踩出来的小路。此后于连受到无微不至的体贴，可是他就是不说话。德·莱纳先生刚一离开，她俩就声称累了，一人挽了他一只胳膊。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As he walked between these women whose cheeks were flushed with the  embarrassment of an intense discomfort, Julien's sombre and decided air formed  a striking contrast. He despised these women, and all tender feelings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他夹在两个女人中间，她们因内心的慌乱而双颊飞上红晕，露出窘色，而于连却脸色苍白，神情阴沉而果决，两者适成奇异的对照。他蔑视这两个女人，也蔑视一切温柔的感情。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'What!' he said to himself, 'not even an allowance of five hundred francs  to complete my studies! Ah! How I should send her packing!'Absorbed in these  drastic thoughts, the little that he deigned to take in of the polite speeches  of the two ladies displeased him as being devoid of meaning, silly, feeble, in  a word feminine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“什么！”他心里说，“我连供我完成学业的五百法郎年金都没有！啊！我真想把他撵走！”他全神贯注于这些严肃的思想，她们俩的殷勤话只是偶而屈尊听进几句，也觉得很不入耳，毫无意义，愚蠢，软弱，一言以蔽之，女人气。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>By dint of talking for talking's sake, and of trying to keep the  conversation alive, Madame de Renal found herself saying that her husband had come  from Verrieres because he had made a bargain, for the purchase of maize straw,  with one of his farmers. (In this district maize straw is used to stuff the palliasses  of the beds.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>没有话还得找话，又想让谈话生动活泼些，于是德·莱纳夫人就说到，他丈夫从维里埃回来，是因为他从一个佃户那里买了些玉米皮（在当地，人们用玉米皮填充床衬）。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My husband will not be joining us again,' Madame de Renal went  on:'he will be busy with the gardener and his valet changing the straw in all the  palliasses in the house. This morning he put fresh straw on all the beds on the  first floor, now he is at work on the second.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我丈夫不会回到我们这儿来了，”她说，“他要和园丁、男仆一起把全家的床衬都换过。今天上午，他把二楼的床衬都换过了玉米皮，现在他正在三楼呢。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Julien changed colour; he looked at Madame de Renal in an odd  manner, and presently drew her apart, so to speak, by increasing his  pace.Madame Derville allowed them to move away from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连的脸色骤变，神情古怪地看了看德·莱纳夫人，立刻拉着她快走了几步，德尔维夫人让他们走开了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Save my life,' said Julien to Madame de Renal, 'you alone can do  it; for you know that the valet hates me like poison. I must confess to  you,Ma'am, that I have a portrait; I have hidden it in the palliasse on my  bed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“救救我的命吧，”于连对德·莱纳夫人说，“只有您能救我的命，因为您知道那个男仆恨我恨得要死。我应该向您坦白，夫人，我有一帧肖像。我把它藏在我那张床的床衬里。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At these words, Madame de Renal in turn grew pale.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>听了这话，德·莱纳夫人的脸色也惨白了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You alone, Ma'am, can go into my room at this moment; feel, without  letting yourself be observed, in the corner of the palliasse nearest to the window;  you will find there a small box of shiny black pasteboard.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“夫人，这个时候只有您才能进我的房间；别让人看见，在床衬最靠近窗户的那个角里摸一摸，有一个小纸盒子，黑色，很光滑。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It contains a  portrait?' said Madame de Renal, barely able to stand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那里面有一帧肖像！”德·菜纳夫人说，快要站不住了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her air of disappointment  was noticed by Julien, who at once took advantage of it.</p>

<p>她的沮丧的神情被于连察觉了，他立刻趁势说道：</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I have a second favour to ask of you, Ma'am; I beg you not to look  at the portrait, it is my secret.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我还要向您求个情，夫人，我求您别看这肖像，这是我的秘密。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is a secret!' repeated Madame de Renal, in faint accents.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“这是个秘密，”德·莱纳夫人重复道，声音极端微弱。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But, albeit she had been reared among people proud of their  wealth,and sensible of pecuniary  interests alone, love had already instilled some generosity into her heart.  Though cruelly wounded, it was with an air of the simplest devotion that Madame de Renal put to Julien the questions necessary  to enable her to execute his commission properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管她在那些以财产自傲并只对金钱利益感兴趣的人中间长大，爱情却已经使她的灵魂变得宽宏大量。德·莱纳夫人被伤得好苦，却仍然表现出最单纯的忠诚，向于连提出了几个必须提出的问题，以保证顺利完成任务。</p>

<p>'And so,' she said, as she left him, 'it is a little round box, of  black pasteboard, and very shiny.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是这样，”她边说边走，“一个小圆盒子，黑纸板的，很光滑。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes, Ma'am,' replied Julien in that hard tone which danger gives a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，夫人，”于连答道，带着男人遇到危险时所具有的那种冷酷的神情。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>She mounted to the second floor of the house, as pale as though she were  going to her death. To complete her misery she felt that she was on the point  of fainting, but the necessity of doing Julien a service restored her strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她登上三楼，脸色苍白，犹如赴死一样。更为不幸的是，她觉得自己马上就要昏倒；可是她必须帮助于连啊，这又给了她力量。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I must have that box,' she said to herself as she quickened her  pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我必须拿到那个盒子，”她对自己说，一面加快了脚步。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She could hear her husband talking to the valet, actually in Julien's room.  Fortunately they moved into the room in which the children slept.She lifted the  mattress and plunged her hand into the straw with such force as to scratch her  fingers. But, although extremely sensitive to slight injuries of this sort, she  was now quite unconscious of the pain, for almost immediately she felt the  polished surface of the pasteboard box.She seized it and fled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她听见丈夫正跟男仆说话，就在于连的房间里。幸好，他们又到孩子们的房间里去了。她掀起床垫，把手伸进床衬，用力过猛，扎破了手指。本来她对这一类的小疼小痛十分敏感，现在却毫无感觉，因为她几乎同时摸到了一个光滑的纸盘子。她一把抓住，转身不见了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>No sooner was she rid of the fear of being surprised by her  husband,than the horror inspired in her by this box made her feel that in  another minute she must unquestionably faint.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她暗自庆幸没有被丈夫撞见，却立刻对这个盒子产生了恐惧，这下她真要病了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So Julien is in love, and I have here the portrait of the woman he loves.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“这么说于连在恋爱了，我这里拿着的是他爱的那个女人的肖像！”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Seated on a chair in the sitting-room of this apartment, Madame de Renal  fell a prey to all the horrors of jealousy. Her extreme ignorance was of  service to her again at this moment; astonishment tempered her grief. Julien  appeared, snatched the box, without thanking her, without saying a word, and  ran into his bedroom, where he struck a light and immediately destroyed it. He  was pale, speechless; he exaggerated to himself the risk he had been running.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人坐在前厅里的一张椅子上，经受着妒火的百般煎熬。她的极端无知这时倒有用了，惊奇减轻了痛苦。于连来了，不道谢，话也不说，一溜烟跑回房间，立刻点火焚烧。他脸色苍白，四肢瘫软，他夸大了刚才所遇到的危险。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'The portrait of Napoleon,' he said to himself with a toss of the  head,'found hidden in the room of a man who professes such hatred for the <a href="#" title="篡夺者
篡位者；篡夺型密友；霸占">usurper</a>! Found  by M. de Renal, so ultra and so angry! and, to complete the imprudence, on the  white card at the back of the portrait, lines in my writing! And lines that can  leave no doubt as to the warmth of my admiration! And each of those transports  of love is dated! There was one only two days ago!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“拿破仑的肖像，”他摇着头对自己说，“居然被发现藏在一个对篡位者怀有深仇大恨的人的房间里！还是被德·莱纳先生发现的，他是那么极端，又那样地被我激怒过！最不谨慎的是，我在肖像后面的白纸板上亲笔写了几行字！我的过分的钦佩之情无可怀疑！而这种仰慕之情的每一次表露都注明了日期！就在前一天还有过一次！</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'All my reputation brought down, destroyed in a moment!' Julien said  to himself as he watched the box burn, 'and my reputation is all I have, I live  by it alone … and what a life at that, great God!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我的名誉将一落千丈，毁于一旦！”于连一边对自己说，一边看着那盒子燃烧，“而我的全部财产就是荣誉呀，我就靠它生活……再说，这是怎样一种生活啊，伟大的天主！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An hour later, his exhaustion and the pity he felt for himself  disposed him to feel affection. He met Madame de Renal and took her hand which he  kissed with more sincerity than he had ever yet shown. She coloured with  delight, and almost simultaneously repulsed Julien with the anger of a jealous  woman. Julien's pride, so recently wounded, made a fool of him at that moment.  He saw in Madame de Renal only a rich woman, he let fall her hand with  contempt, and strode away. He went out and walked pensively in the garden;  presently a bitter smile appeared on his lips.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>一个钟头以后，疲倦，他对自己的怜悯，都使他的心软下来。看见德·菜纳夫人，拿起她的手，怀着从未有过的那份真诚吻着。她幸福地脸红了，但几乎同时有怀着嫉妒的怒火推开了于连。于连早上被刺伤的自傲使他此时此刻成了一个大傻瓜。他在德·莱纳夫人身上只看见一个富家女，于是他厌恶地扔下她的手，扬长而去。他去花园，散步，沉思，他的嘴角很快露出一丝苦笑：</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'Here I am walking about as calm as a man who is his own master! I am  not looking after the children! I am exposing myself to the humiliating remarks  of M. de Renal, and he will be justified.' He hastened to the children's room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
  <p>“我在这里散步，倒是悠闲得像一个有权支配自己的时间的人！我丢下孩子们不管。我又要听到德·莱纳先生那些让人感到屈辱的话了，而他是有理由的。”于是，他朝孩子们的房间走去，</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The caresses of the youngest boy, to whom he was greatly  attached,did something to soothe his agonising pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他很喜欢最小的那—个，孩子的亲近稍许平复了他的剧烈的痛苦。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This one does not despise me yet,' thought Julien. But presently he  blamed himself for this relief from pain, as for a fresh weakness. These children  fondle me as they might fondle the puppy that was bought yesterday.'</p>

</div>
  <div class="right">
  

<p>“这孩子还不蔑视我，”于连想。然而，他很快自责起来，将这痛苦的缓解视为新的软弱。“这些孩子亲近我就像他们亲近昨天买来的小猎狗一样。”   </p>
