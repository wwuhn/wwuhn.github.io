<p>加斯特尔，一六七六。－－－一个人刚在与我的房子邻近的一所房子里杀死了他的亲姐妹。这个绅士已经犯过一术士谋杀罪。那一次他的父亲私下里分送了五百埃居给那些推事，救了他的性命。</p>

<p>On leaving the Bishop's palace, Mathilde did  not hesitate to send a messenger to Madame de Fervaques; the fear of  compromising herself did not restrain her for a second. She implored her rival  to obtain a letter for M. de Frilair, written throughout in the hand of the  Lord Bishop of ——. She even went the length of beseeching the other to hasten,  herself,to Besancon. This was a heroic measure on the part of a proud and  jealous spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>走出主教府，玛蒂尔德没有犹豫，立刻送了一封信给德·费瓦克夫人；虽然也担心影响自己的名誉，但是她一秒钟也未耽搁。她恳求她的情敌去让德·某某主教大人从头到尾亲笔写一封信给德·福利莱先生。她甚至求她亲自跑一趟贝藏松。就一颗嫉妒而骄傲的心灵来说，这个举动颇有英雄气概。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On the advice of Fouque, she had taken the  precaution of saying nothing about what she was doing to Julien. Her presence  was disturbing enough in itself. A more honourable man at the approach of death  than he had been during his life, he now felt compunction at the thought not only  of M. de La Mole, but also of Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她听从了富凯的忠告，为谨慎计，没有把她进行的一系列活动说给于连听。单单她来就已经够让他不安的了。死亡越来越近，他也变得比一生中任何时候都正直，他的悔恨不仅仅是对着德·拉莫尔先生的，也是对着玛蒂尔德的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What is this?' he asked himself, 'I  experience in her company moments of abstraction and even of boredom. She is  ruining herself for me, and it is thus that I reward her. Can I indeed be  wicked?' This question would have troubled him little when he was ambitious;  then, not to succeed in life was the only disgrace in his eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！”他对自己说，“我跟她在一起，有时候心不在焉，甚至有时候烦闷无聊。她为了我身败名裂，而我竟这样报答她！难道我是个恶人吗？”这个问题，他在野心勃勃的时候不大会放在心上，那时候，不能成功他才认作是最大的耻辱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His moral uneasiness, in Mathilde's  presence, was all the more marked, in that he inspired in her at that moment  the most extraordinary. I am indebted to the patience and ingenuity of Mr.  Vyvyan Holland, who has traced the original text of this motto in The Life of  John Locke, with extracts from his Correspondence, Journals and Commonplace  Books by Lord King (new edition, 1830) C. K. S. M. and insensate passion. She could  speak of nothing but the strange sacrifices which she was anxious to make to  save him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他对玛蒂尔德感到的精神痛苦越发顽固了，因为他此刻激起了她最离奇、最疯狂的热情。她满口都是她为了救他而打算做出的种种奇特的牺牲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Carried away by a sentiment of which she was  proud and which completely overbore her pride, she would have liked not to  allow a moment of her life to pass that was not filled with some extraordinary  action. The strangest plans, the most perilous to herself, formed the theme of  her long conversations with Julien. His gaolers, well rewarded, allowed her to  have her way in the prison. Mathilde's ideas were not confined to the sacrifice  of her reputation; it mattered nothing to her though she made her condition  known to the whole of society. To fling herself on her knees to crave pardon  for Julien, in front of the King's carriage as it came by at a gallop, to  attract the royal attention, at the risk of a thousand deaths, was one of the  tamest fancies of this exalted and courageous imagination. Through her friends  who held posts at court, she could count upon being admitted to the reserved  parts of the park of SaintCloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她受到一种她引为自豪的、压倒她全部自尊心的感情的激励，真想让她的生命的每时每刻都充满着某种非凡的举动。她跟于连的长谈中尽是最奇特、对她最危险的计划。看守们被打发得好好的，让她在监狱里为所欲为。玛蒂尔德的主意并不局限于牺牲名节，她可不在乎让整个社会都知道她的状况。跪倒在国王奔驰的马车前，引起亲王的注意，冒死请求赦免于连，这还是她那狂热勇敢的想象力所虚构出来的最实在的幻想呢，通过她那些在国王身边任职的朋友，她确信能够进入圣克卢花园里的那些禁地。  </p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien felt himself to be hardly worthy of  such devotion, to tell the truth he was tired of heroism. It would have  required a simple, artless,almost timid affection to appeal to him, whereas on  the contrary,Mathilde's proud spirit must always entertain the idea of a  public, of what people would say.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连觉得自己配不上如此的献身精神。老实说，他已对英雄主义感到疲倦。要是面对一种单纯的、天真的、近乎羞怯的爱情，他会动心的。然而玛伦尔德那颗高傲的心灵恰正相反，需要时时刻刻想到公众，想到别人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In the midst of all her anguish, of all her  fears for the life of this lover,whom she was determined not to outlive, she  had a secret longing to astonish the public by the intensity of her love and  the sublimity of her actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她不想苟活于情夫之后，然而在她对他的生命怀有的焦虑和恐惧当中，她有一种秘不示人的需要，即用她那爱情的过度和行动的崇高让公众大吃一惊。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He resented the discovery that he was unable  to feel at all touched by all this heroism. What would his resentment have  been, had he known of all the follies with which Mathilde overpowered the  devoted, but eminently reasonable and limited mind of the good Fouque?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连毫不为这种英雄主义所动，为此颇感恼火。然而，他若知道玛蒂尔德如何用她那些疯狂的念头折磨善良的富凯那忠诚但非常理智狭隘的精神，他又会怎样呢？   </p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The latter could scarcely find fault with  Mathilde's devotion; for he,too, would have sacrificed his whole fortune and  exposed his life to the greatest risks to save Julien. He was stupefied by the  quantity of gold which Mathilde scattered abroad. At first, the sums thus spent  impressed Fouque, who had for money all the veneration of a provincial.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对于玛蒂尔德的忠诚，富凯说不出什么，他自己也是为了救于连可以牺牲全部财产，拿生命去冒最大的风险。只是玛蒂尔德挥金如土，令他骇然。最初几天，这样花去的钱数目之大，使富凯肃然起敬，他和所有的外省人一样，对金钱十分地崇敬。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Later, he discovered that Mademoiselle de La  Mole's plans often varied, and, to his great relief, found a word with which to  reproach this character which was so exhausting to him: she was changeable. To  this epithet, that of wrong-headed, the direst anathema in the provinces, is  the immediate sequel.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最后。他发现德·拉莫尔小姐的计划经常变动，使他大感快慰的是，他终于找到一个词来责备这种他觉得如此令人疲倦的性格：她变化无常。从变化无常到外省最厉害的诅咒“标新立异”，两个形容词之间，仅一步之隔。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is strange,' Julien said to himself one  day as Mathilde was leaving his prison, 'that so warm a passion, and one of  which I am the object,leaves me so unmoved! And I worshipped her two months  ago! I have indeed read that at the approach of death we lose interest in  everything;but it is frightful to feel oneself ungrateful and to be unable to  change.Can I be an egoist?' He heaped on himself,  in this connection, the most humiliating reproaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真奇怪，”玛蒂尔德离开监狱，于连暗想道，“一种如此热烈的激情，又是以我为对象，我却这样地麻木！两个月前我却是崇拜她的！我在书里读过，死亡的临近使人对什么都失去兴趣；然而可怕的是自觉忘恩负义又自觉不能改变。我难道是一个利己主义者吗？”他为此狠狠地责备和羞辱自己。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Ambition was dead in his heart, another  passion had risen from its ashes; he called it remorse for having murdered  Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>野心已在他的心中死去，灰烬中生出了另一种激情，他称之为谋害德·菜纳夫人的悔恨。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As a matter of fact, he was hopelessly in  love with her. He found a strange happiness when, left absolutely alone and  without any fear of being disturbed, he could abandon himself entirely to the  memory of the happy days which he had spent in the past at Verrieres or at  Vergy. The most trifling incidents of that time, too swiftly flown, had for him  a freshness and a charm that were irresistible. He never gave a thought to his  Parisian successes; they bored him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>事实上，他是在狂热地爱着她。他独处且不担心有人打扰的时候，他可以纵情回忆从前在维里埃的韦尔吉度过的美好时光，这时他就感到一种独特的幸福。那段飞逝的时光中发生的事情，哪怕再微不足道、对他都具有一种不可抵抗的新鲜和魅力。他从不想他在巴黎的成功，他已经厌倦了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This tendency, which grew rapidly stronger,  was not entirely hidden from the jealous Mathilde. She saw quite plainly that  she had to contend with the love of solitude. Now and again, she uttered with  terror in her heart the name of Madame de Renal. She saw Julien shudder. From  that moment, her passion knew no bounds nor measure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这种心情迅速加剧，已被玛蒂尔德的嫉妒猜出几分。她清楚地意识到，她得跟他对孤独的爱好作斗争。有几次，她怀着恐惧讲出了德·莱纳夫人的名字。她看见于连打了个哆嗦。从此，她的激情汪洋恣肆，漫无边际了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If he dies, I die after him,' she said to  herself with absolute sincerity.'What would the drawing-rooms of Paris say,  to see a girl of my rank carry to such a point her adoration of a lover  condemned to death? To find such sentiments, we must go back to the days of the  heroes; it was love of this nature that set hearts throbbing in the age of  Charles IX and Henri III.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果他死了，我就跟着他死，”她对自己说，要多真诚有多真诚。“巴黎的那些客厅看见我这样地位的一个女孩子对一个行将赴死的情人崇拜到这种程度，会说些什么呢？要找到这样的感情，必须回溯到英雄时代。在查理九世和亨利三世的时代，使人心跳的正是这样的爱情呀。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amid the most impassioned transports, when  she pressed Julien's head to her heart: 'What!' she said to herself with  horror, 'can this precious head be doomed to fall? Very well!' she added,  inflamed by a heroism that was not devoid of happiness, 'my lips, which are now  pressed against these dear locks, will be frozen within twenty-four hours  after.' </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她紧紧地把于连的头搂在心口，沉浸在最强烈的冲动之中。“怎么！”她惊恐地想道，“这颗迷人的头注定要落地！那好吧！”她又想，周身燃烧着一种不乏幸福感的英雄气概，“我的嘴唇现在亲吻着这美丽的头发，他死后不出二十四个钟头就会变得冰凉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Memories of these moments of heroism and  fearful ecstasy seized her in an ineluctable grip. The thought of suicide, so  absorbing in itself, and hitherto so remote from that proud spirit, penetrated  its defences and soon reigned there with an absolute sway. 'No, the blood of my  ancestors has not grown lukewarm in its descent to me,' Mathilde told herself proudly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她老是想起这些变满英雄气概和可怕的快乐的时刻，难以摆脱，自杀的念头，本身是那样地缠人，在此之前还远离着这颗高傲的心，现在已经深入进去，很快便建立了绝对的统治。“不，我的先人的血流到我身上还一点儿也没有变温。”她对自己说，很骄傲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>I have a favour to ask you,' her lover said  to her one day: Put your child out to nurse at Verrieres, Madame de Renal will  look after the nurse.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我有一事要求您，”一天她的情人对她说，“把您的孩子寄养在维里埃，德·莱纳夫人会照应的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That is a very harsh saying… ' Mathilde  turned pale.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您对我说的这话太冷酷了……”玛蒂尔德的脸白了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'True, and I ask a thousand pardons,' cried  Julien, awakening from his dream and pressing her to his bosom.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“的确如此，我求你千万原谅，”于连从冥想中醒过来，大声说，并把她紧紧抱在怀里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Having dried her tears, he returned to the  subject of his thoughts, but with more subtlety. He had given the conversation  a turn of melancholy philosophy. He spoke of that future which was soon to  close for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他揩干了她的眼泪，又回到原来的想法中去了，不过做得巧妙些了。他让谈话具有一种忧郁哲学的情调，他谈到那即将在他面前关闭的未来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You must agree, my dear friend, that the  passions are an accident in life,but this accident is to be found only in  superior beings … The death of my son would be in reality a relief to the pride  of your family, so much the subordinate agents will perceive. Neglect will be  the lot of that child of misery and shame… I hope that at a date which I do not  wish to specify, which however I have the courage to anticipate, you will obey  my final behest: You will marry the Marquis de Croisenois.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“应该承认，亲爱的朋友，激情在人生中是一种意外，然而此种意外唯有在出类拔萃之人中间才会发生……我儿子的死实际上对您的家庭的自尊心是一大幸事，那些底下人会看出来的。被忽视将是这个不幸与耻辱之子的命运……我希望在一个我尚不能确定但我的勇气还能隐约看见的时候，您会听从我最后的嘱咐：嫁给德·克参瓦泽努瓦侯爵先生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What, dishonoured!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么！让我丧失名誉！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Dishonour can have no hold over such a name  as yours. You will be a widow, and the widow of a madman, that is all. I shall  go farther: my crime, being free from any pecuniary motive, will be in no way  dishonouring. Perhaps by that time some philosophical legislator will have  secured, from the prejudices of his contemporaries, the suppression of capital  punishment. Then, some friendly voice will cite as an instance: &quot;Why,Mademoiselle  de La Mole's first husband was mad, but not a wicked man, he was no criminal.  It was absurd to cut his head off … &quot; Then my memory will cease to be  infamous; at least, after a certain time… Your position in society, your  fortune, and, let me say, your genius will enable M. de Croisenois to play a  part, once he is your husband, to which by himself he could not hope to attain.He has only his birth and his gallantry, and  those qualities by themselves, which made a man accomplished in 1729, are an  anachronism a hundred years later, and only give rise to pretensions. A man  must have other things besides if he is to place himself at the head of the  youth of France.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“丧失名誉落不到您这样的姓氏上去。您将是寡妇，一个疯子的寡妇，如此而已。我还要进一步说，我的罪行没有金钱的动机，丝毫也不是可耻的。也许将来某位贤明的立法者会战胜同时代人的偏见，取消了死刑。那时候某个同情我的声音会把我作为例子举出来：‘瞧，德·拉莫尔小姐的第一个丈夫是个疯子，但不是一个恶人，不是一个坏蛋。当时让他人头落地是荒谬的……’那时候我的身后之名绝不是令人厌恶的。至少过些时候……您的社会地位，您的财产，请容我说，还有您的才华，将使成为您的丈夫的德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦担任一个他独力不能担任的角色。他只有出身和勇敢，单靠这两种长处，可以在一七二九年造就一个完人，可是在一个世纪后的今天，就不合时宜了，只能使人自视甚高。要想领导法国青年，还得有其它的东西。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You will bring the support of a firm and  adventurous character to the political party in which you will place your  husband. You may succeed the Chevreuses and Longuevilles of the Fronde… But by  then, my dear friend, the heavenly fire which animates you at this moment will  have cooled a little.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您将把您的丈夫推进一个政党，又用您那坚定大胆的性格支持这个政党。您能够成为投石党运动中的那些谢弗勒兹和隆格维尔们的接班人……不过那时候，亲爱的朋友，此刻激励着您的这股圣洁的火可能不那么热了。投石党运动是路易十四执政初期的一次反对专制制度的政治运动，谢弗勒兹和隆格维尔两位公爵夫人都在运动中起过重要的作用。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Allow me to tell you,' he went on, after  many other preliminary phrases, 'in fifteen years from now you will regard as  an act of folly, pardonable but still an act of folly, the love that you have  felt for me … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请允许我对您说，”他说了许多作为准备的话之后，最后补充道，“十五年后，您会把您曾对我怀有的爱情看作一种可以原谅的疯狂，但终究是一种疯狂……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He broke off abruptly and returned to his  dreams. He found himself once again confronted by that idea, so shocking to  Mathilde: 'In fifteen years Madame de Renal will adore my son, and you will  have forgotten him.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他突然不说了，变得若有所思。他又重新面对这使玛蒂尔德感到如此恼怒的念头：“十五年后，德·莱纳夫人会热爱我的儿子，而您早已把他忘掉。”</p>
</div></div>
