  <div class="left"><p>'The  gentleman is waiting, surely, for the mail-coach for Paris?' he was asked by  the landlord of an inn at which he stopped to break his fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“先生想必是等去巴黎的驿车吧？”于连停下在一家旅店吃午饭，店主人问。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Today  or tomorrow, it is all the same to me,' said Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“今天的，明天的，无所谓。”于连说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  coach arrived while he was feigning indifference. There were two places vacant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正当他作心不在焉状的时候，驿车到了。有两个空位子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  It is you, my poor Falcoz,' said the traveller, who had come from the direction  of Geneva to him who now entered the coach with Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！是你呀，我可怜的法尔考兹，”从日内瓦方向来的那位旅客对跟于连一起上车的人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  thought you had settled in the neighbourhood of Lyons,' said Falcoz,'in a  charming valley by the Rhone.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我还以为你已经在里昂附近，罗纳河畔一个迷人的山谷里安顿下来了呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Settled,  indeed! I am running away.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好一个安顿下来！我在逃呢。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  Running away? You, Saint Giraud! With that honest face of yours, have you  committed a crime?' said Falcoz, with a laugh.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！你在逃？你，圣吉罗！老实巴交的样子，难道你犯了什么罪不成？”法尔考兹笑着说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Upon  my soul, not far off it. I am running away from the abominable life one leads  in the country. I love the shade of the woods and the quiet of the fields, as  you know; you have often accused me of being romantic.The  one thing I never wished to hear mentioned was politics, and politics pursue me  everywhere.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说真的，也差不多了。我逃避外省的那种讨厌的生活。你知道，我喜欢树林的清新和田野的宁静；你常常责备我想入非非。我一辈子都不想再听人谈政治了，可还是政治把我赶了出来。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  to what party do you belong?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那你在哪一党？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  none, and that is what has been fatal to me. These are all my politics: I enjoy  music, and painting; a good book is an event in my life; I shall soon be four  and forty. How many years have I to live? Fifteen, twenty, thirty, perhaps, at  the most. Very well; I hold that in thirty years from now, our Ministers will  be a little more able, but otherwise just as good fellows as we have today. The  history of England serves as a mirror to show me our future. There will always  be a King who seeks to extend his prerogative; the ambition to enter  Parliament, the glory and the hundreds of thousands of francs amassed by  Mirabeau will always keep our wealthy provincials awake at night: they will  call that being Liberal and loving the people. The desire to become a Peer or a  Gentleman in Waiting will always possess the Ultras. On board the Ship of  State, everyone will wish to be at the helm, for the post is well paid. Will  there never be a little corner anywhere for the mere passenger?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“哪一党也不在，正是这把我毁了。我的全部政治是这样：我喜欢音乐，绘画，一本好书对我来说是—件大事；我快四十岁了。我还能活多久呢？十五年，二十年，最多三十年？那又怎么样呢？我坚信三十年后部长们会稍许机灵些，但和今天的部长们一样正派。我把英国的历史当作我们未来的一面镜子。总会有一位国王想增加他的特权；想当议员的野心、成为贵族院议员和米拉波挣的那几十万法郎，总会让外省的有钱人睡不着觉：他们把这叫作当自由党和爱人民。成为贵族院议员或内宫侍从的欲望使极端保王党们奔窜不已。在国家这条船上，人人都想掌舵，因为给的报酬多啊。难道就没有一个可怜的小小的位子给普通旅客吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why,  of course, and a very pleasant one, too, for a man of your peaceful nature. Is  it the last election that is driving you from your district?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是啊，是啊，那对你这个性情平和的人来说倒是很有意思的。是最近的选举把你赶出了外省吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  trouble dates from farther back. I was, four years ago, forty years old, and  had five hundred thousand francs, I am four years older now, and have probably  fifty thousand less, which I shall lose by the sale of my place, Monfleury, by  the Rhone, a superb position.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的不幸由来已久。四年前，我四十岁，有五十万法郎。今天，我多了四岁，却大概要少五万法郎，我在卖掉座落在罗纳河畔、位置极佳的蒙夫勒里古堡时要损失这个数目。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  Paris, I was tired of that perpetual play-acting, to which one is driven by  what you call nineteenth-century civilisation. I felt a longing for human  fellowship and simplicity. I bought a piece of land in the mountains by the  Rhone, the most beautiful spot in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在巴黎，我厌倦了你们所谓的十九世纪文明迫使人们扮演的那种没完没了的喜剧。我渴望着温情和淳朴。我在靠近罗纳河的山里买了一块地，天底下没有那么美的地方了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  vicar of the village and the neighbouring squires made much of me for the first  six months; I had them to dine; I had left Paris, I told them, so as never to  mention or to hear of politics again. You see, I subscribe to no newspaper. The  fewer letters the postman brings me, the happier I am.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“村里的本堂神甫和附近的绅士给我献了六个月的殷勤，我请他们吃晚饭，我对他们说：‘我离开巴黎，为的是一辈子不再谈论也不再听别人谈论政治，你们看到了，我什么报纸也没订，邮差给我送的信越少，我越高兴。’</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  was not what the vicar wanted; presently I was besieged with endless indiscreet  requests, intrigues, and so forth. I wished to give two or three hundred francs  every year to the poor, they pestered me for them on behalf of pious  associations; Saint Joseph, Our Lady, and so forth. I refused: then I came in  for endless insults. I was foolish enough to show annoyance. I could no longer  leave the house in the morning to go and enjoy the beauty of our mountain  scenery, without meeting some bore who would interrupt my thoughts with an  unpleasant reminder of my fellow men and their evil ways. In the Rogation tide  processions, for instance, the chanting in which I like (it is probably a Greek  melody),they no longer bless my fields, because, the vicar says, they belong to  an unbeliever. A pious old peasant woman's cow dies, she says that it is  because there is a pond close by which belongs to me, the unbeliever, a  philosopher from Paris, and a week later I find all my fish floating on the  water, poisoned with lime. I am surrounded by trickery in every form.The  justice of the peace, an honest man, but afraid of losing his place, always  decides against me. The peace of the fields is hell to me. As soon as they saw  me abandoned by the vicar, head of the village Congregation, and not supported  by the retired captain, head of the Liberals, they all fell upon me, even the  mason who had been living upon me for a year, even the wheelwright, who tried  to get away with cheating me when he mended my ploughs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“副本堂神甫不满意了，我成了无数明目张胆的要求、纠缠等等的目标。我想每年舍给穷人二、三百法郎，可人家要我送给宗教团体：圣约瑟夫会啦，圣母会啦，等等，我拒绝了，于是人家就百般羞辱我。我真蠢，居然恼了。我早晨出去享受我们山区的美景，总要碰上什么烦恼打破我的梦想，让我很不舒服地想起人，想起人的恶毒。祈祷游行的歌曲我很喜欢（大概是一支希腊曲子），可人家不再为我的田地祝福了，因为副本堂神甫说，这些田地属于一个不信神的人。一个虔诚的老农妇死了母牛，就说是因为靠近了属于我这个不信神的人、来自巴黎的哲学家的一口池塘，而一个礼拜以后我发现塘里所有的鱼都肚子朝了天，被石灰毒死了。各种形式的纠缠包围着我。治安法官本是个正直的人，可他害怕丢了位置，就总是说我不对。田野的宁静对我来说成了一座地狱。一旦他们看见我被村圣会首脑副本堂神甫抛弃，自由党的头目退休上尉也不支持我，就都朝我扑过来，包括我养活了一年的泥水匠，甚至为我修犁的车匠也想白白地欺骗我。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  order to have some footing and to win a few at least of my lawsuits, I turned  Liberal; but, as you were saying, those damned elections came, they asked me  for my vote… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为了获得支持和打赢几场官司，我当了自由党；但是，正如你所说，这场鬼选举来了，人家要我投票……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  a stranger?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“选一个不认识的人？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Not  a bit of it, for a man I know only too well. I refused, a fearful imprudence!  From that moment, I had the Liberals on top of me as well, my position became  intolerable. I believe that if it had ever entered the vicar's head to accuse  me of having murdered my servant, there would have been a score of witnesses  from both parties, ready to swear that they had seen me commit the crime.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“完全不是，这个人我太认识了。我拒绝了，真是可怕的不谨慎！从这时起，自由党又缠住了我，我的处境变得不堪忍受。我相信，假如副本堂神甫想控告我杀了我的女仆，准会有二十个证人分别从两个党派里站出来作证，发誓说是亲眼所见。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  wish to live in the country without ministering to your neighbours' passions,  without even listening to their gossip. What a mistake!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你想住在乡下，却又不为你的邻居们的欲望效劳，甚至不听他们的高谈阔论。多大的错误啊……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have made amends for it now. Monfleury is for sale. I shall lose fifty thousand  francs, if I must, but I am overjoyed, I am leaving that hell of hypocrisy and  malice. I am going to seek solitude and rustic peace in the one place in France  where they exist, in a fourth-floor apartment, overlooking the Champs Elysees.  And yet I am just thinking whether I shall not begin my political career, in  the Roule quarter, by presenting the blessed bread in the parish church.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“错误总算得到了弥补。我正在卖蒙夫勒里古堡，必要的话就损失五万法郎，不过我很快活，我离开了这座伪善和烦恼的地狱。我要去寻找孤独和田园的宁静，这在法国只能到开向香榭丽舍大街的五层楼上去找了。而且我还得考虑考虑，如果我不在鲁尔区①通过给教区送祝福面包来开始我的政治生涯的话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'None  of that would have happened to you under Bonaparte,' said Falcoz, his eyes  shining with anger and regret.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要是在拿破仑统治下，这一切都不会落在你的头上，”法尔考兹说，他两眼放光，闪烁着愤怒和遗憾。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That's  all very well, but why couldn't he keep going, your Bonaparte?Everything  that I suffer from today is his doing.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但愿如此，可你那波拿巴为什么自己都站不住脚？今天我的一切痛苦都是他造成的。”</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Here  Julien began to listen with increased attention. He had realized from the first  that the Bonapartist Falcoz was the early playmate of M. de Renal, repudiated  by him in 1816, while the philosopher Saint-Giraud must be a brother of that  chief clerk in the Prefecture of ——, who knew how to have municipal property  knocked down to him on easy terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>说到这儿，于连更加注意了。他从第一句话就明白了，波拿巴分子法尔考兹就是德·莱纳先生于一八一六年绝交的儿时老友，而哲学家圣吉罗应该是知道如何通过招标为自己廉价租到公房的那个某省科长的兄弟。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  all that has been your Bonaparte's doing,' Saint Giraud continued: 'An honest  man, harmless if ever there was one, forty years old and with five hundred  thousand francs, can't settle down in the country and find peace there.  Bonaparte's priests and nobles drive him out again.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这一切都是你的波拿巴干的，”圣吉罗继续说，“一个正直的人，从无害人之心，四十岁拥有五万法郎却不能在外省定居，平安度日；那些教士和贵族把他赶了出去。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  You must not speak evil of him,' cried Falcoz, 'never has France stood so high  in the esteem of foreign nations as during the thirteen years of his reign. In  those days, everything that was done had greatness in it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！别说他的坏话，”法尔考兹嚷道，“法国从未像他统治下的十三年中那样受到各国人民的尊敬。那时候，人们所做的一切都透着伟大。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Your  Emperor, may the devil fly away with him,' went on the man of four and forty,  'was great only upon his battle-fields, and when he restored our financial  balance in 1801. What was the meaning of all his conduct after that? With his  chamberlains and his pomp and his receptions at the Tuileries, he simply  furnished a new edition of all the stuff and nonsense of the monarchy. It was a  corrected edition, it might have served for a century or two. The nobles and  priests preferred to return to the old edition, but they have not the iron hand  that they need to bring it before the public.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你的皇帝，让他见鬼去吧，”四十岁的人又说，“他只在战场上才伟大，还有他在一八Ｏ二年重建财政的时候。从那以后他的所作所为又该怎么说呢？他用他那些内侍、排场和杜伊勒里宫的招待会为王政的种种愚蠢造了一个新版本。这个版本经过修改，还能用一个或两个世纪。贵族和教士想回到老版本上去，可他们缺少向公众推销所必须的铁腕。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Listen  to the old printer talking!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真是一个旧印刷厂主的腔调啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  is it that is turning me off my land?' went on the printer with heat. 'The  priests, whom Napoleon brought back with his Concordat, instead of treating  them as the State treats doctors, lawyers, astronomers, of regarding them  merely as citizens, without inquiring into the trade by which they earn their  living. Would there be these insolent gentlemen today if your Bonaparte had not  created barons and counts? No, the fashion had passed. Next to the priests, it  is the minor country nobles that have annoyed me most, and forced me to turn  Liberal.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是谁把我从我的土地上赶走的？”愤怒的印刷厂主继续说。“国家对待教士应像对待医生、律师、天文学家一样，把他们当作公民而不操心他们想什么法子谋生，可拿破仑却用他的和解沼书重新把他们又招了回未。如果你的拿破仑没有封什么子爵和伯爵，今天会有那些蛮横无礼的贵人吗？不，时髦已过。除了教士，就是那些乡村小贵族了，他们最让我恼火，强迫我当了自由党。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  discussion was endless, this theme will occupy the minds and tongues of France  for the next half-century. As Saint Giraud kept on repeating that it was  impossible to live in the provinces, Julien timidly cited the example of M. de  Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>谈话没完没了，这个话题法国还要谈上半个世纪。由于圣吉罗翻来覆去总是说外省无法生活，于连就怯生生地提出德·莱纳先生的例子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Egad,  young man, you're a good one!' cried Falcoz, 'he has turned himself into a  hammer so as not to be made the anvil, and a terrible hammer at that. But I can  see him cut out by Valenod. Do you know that rascal? He's the real article.  What will your M. de Renal say when he finds himself turned out of office one  of these fine days, and Valenod filling his place?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好哇，年轻人，您真善良！”法尔考兹叫了起来；“他不想作砧于，就作了锤子，而且还是一把可怕的锤子。不过我看见瓦勒诺那家伙已经超过了他。您认识那个流氓吗？那可是个真的呀。要是您的德·莱纳先生一旦看见自己被解职并被瓦勒诺那家伙取代，他会说什么呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  will be left to meditate on his crimes,' said Saint Giraud. 'So you know  Verrieres, young man, do you? Very good! Bonaparte, whom heaven confound, made  possible the reign of the Renals and Chelans, which has paved the way for the  reign of the Valenods and Maslons.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他将和他的罪行面面相觑，”圣吉罗说。“这么说您是了解维里埃的罗，年轻人？那好吧！波拿巴，让他和他那些王政的骗局见鬼去吧，是他让菜纳们和谢朗们的统治成为可能，而他们的统治又带来了瓦勒诺们和马斯隆们的统治。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  talk of shady politics astonished Julien, and took his thoughts from his dreams  of sensual bliss.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这次有关一种黑暗政治的谈话使于连感到惊讶，把他从那些撩人的非非之想中拉了出来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was little impressed by the first view of Paris seen in the distance.is  fantastic imaginings of the future in store for him had to do battle with the  still vivid memory of the twenty-four hours which he had just spent at  Verrieres. He made a vow that he would never abandon his mistress's children,  but would give up everything to protect them, should the impertinences of the  priests give us a Republic and lead to persecutions of the nobility.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他远远地望见了巴黎，竟然无所感觉。他刚刚在维里埃度过的二十四个钟头还历历在目，正在和他建筑在未来命运上的海市蜃楼进行搏斗。他发誓永不抛弃他的情人的孩子们，假使教士们的傲慢无理给我们带来共和国并且迫害贵族的话，他会不惜一切保护他们的。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>What  would have happened to him on the night of his arrival at Verrieres if, at the  moment when he placed his ladder against Madame de Renal's bedroom window, he  had found that room occupied by a stranger, or by M. de Renal?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在他到维里埃的那天夜里，当他把梯子放在德·莱纳夫人的卧室窗户底下的时候，如果住在里面的是一个陌生人或者竟是德·莱纳先生，那会发生什么事呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  also what bliss in those first few hours, when his mistress really wished to  send him away, and he pleaded his cause, seated by her side in the darkness! A  mind like Julien's is pursued by such memories for a lifetime. The rest of  their meeting had already merged into the first phases of their love, fourteen  months earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，开始的两个钟头，当他的情人真的想把他赶走而他在黑暗中坐在她身边为自己申辩的时候，那又是多么地甜蜜啊！对于连这种人，此类回忆会跟他一辈子的。这次相会余下的部分已经和十四个月前他们相爱的最初时光融为一体了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was awakened from his profound abstraction by the stopping of the carriage.  They had driven into the courtyard of the post-house in the rue Jean Jacques  Rousseau. 'I wish to go to La  Malmaison,' he told the driver of a passing cabriolet. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连从深沉的梦幻中惊醒，车停了，刚刚进入让雅克·卢梭街驿站院内。一辆双轮轻马车走近了，他说：“我要去马尔梅松。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'At this time of night,  Sir? What to do?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个时候，先生？干么去？”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'What  business is it of yours? Drive on.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“关您什么事？走吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>True  passion thinks only of itself. That, it seems to me, is why the passions are so  absurd in Paris, where one's neighbour always insists upon one's thinking  largely of him. I shall not describe Julien's transports at La Malmaison. He  wept. What! In spite of the ugly white walls set up this year, which divide the  park in pieces? Yes, sir; for Julien, as for posterity, there was no  distinction between Arcole, Saint Helena and La Malmaison.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一切真正的激情都是只想着自己。这就是为什么我觉得在巴黎激情是那么可笑，一个人总是声称邻居多么想着他。我就不说于连在马尔梅松多么激动了。他哭了。怎么！他没看见今年修的那些可恶的白墙把花园割成了一块一块的吗？是的，先生，对于连和对后人一样，在阿尔考、圣赫勒拿岛和巴尔梅松之间没有任何区别。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, Julien hesitated for long before entering the play-house; he had  strange ideas as to that sink of iniquity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，于连几番犹豫，方才进了剧院，他对这种使人堕落的地方有些奇特的想法。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  intense distrust prevented him from admiring the Paris of today, he was moved  only by the monuments bequeathed by his hero.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一种深深的疑虑使他不能欣赏活的巴黎，只有他的英雄留下的那些遗迹才让他感动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  here I am in the centre of intrigue and hypocrisy! This is where the abbe de  Frilair's protectors reign.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我这就到了阴谋和伪善的中心了！统治这里的是德·福利莱神甫的保护者们。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the evening of the third day, curiosity prevailed over his plan of seeing  everything before calling upon the abbe Pirard.The  said abbe explained to him, in a frigid tone, the sort of life that awaited him  at M. de La Mole's.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第三天的晚上，他拗不过好奇心，打消了在见彼拉神甫之前什么都看看的计划。神甫口吻冷淡，向他解释了德·拉莫尔先生家里等待着他的生活是什么样子。</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>'If  after a few months you are of no use to him, you will return to the Seminary,  but by the front door. You are going to lodge with the Marquis, one of the  greatest noblemen in France. You will dress in black, but like a layman in  mourning, not like a churchman. I require that, thrice weekly, you pursue your  theological studies in a Seminary, where I shall introduce you. Each day, at  noon, you will take your place in the library of the Marquis, who intends to  employ you in writing letters with reference to lawsuits and other business.  The Marquis notes down, in a word or two, upon the margin of each letter that  he receives, the type of answer that it requires. I have undertaken that, by  the end of three months, you will have learned to compose these answers to such  effect that, of every twelve which you present to the Marquis for his  signature, he will be able to sign eight or nine. In the evening, at eight  o'clock, you will put his papers in order, and at ten you will be free.</p>

<p>“如果几个月后您还没有用，您就回神学院，不过这次是从前门进去。您要住在侯爵家里，他是法国最大的贵族之一。您要穿黑衣，但不是像个教士，而是像一个服丧的人。我要求您每个礼拜三次到我介绍您去的神学院里上神学课。每天中午，您就坐在侯爵的图书室里，他要让您写些有关诉讼和其他事务的信件。侯爵在他收到的每一封信的空白处用几句话写明回复的要点。我说过，不出三个月，您就能写回信了，呈给侯爵签字的十二封信中他可以签上八、九封。晚上八点钟，您整理他的办公桌，十点钟您就自由了。”</p>

<p>'It  may happen,' the abbe Pirard continued, 'that some old lady or some man of  persuasive speech will hint to you the prospect of immense advantages, or quite  plainly offer you money to let him see the letters received by the Marquis… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可能，”彼拉神甫继续说，“会有某位老妇人或某位口吻甜密的先生让您隐隐约约看见巨大的好处，或者直接了当地给您钱，想看看侯爵收到的信……”，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  Sir!' cried Julien, blushing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊，先生！”于连叫了起来，脸红了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is strange,' said the abbe with a bitter smile, 'that, poor as you are, and  after a year of Seminary, you still retain these virtuous indignations.You  must indeed have been blind!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“奇怪呀，”神甫苦笑了一声，说，“您这样穷，还在神学院里呆了一年，居然还有这义愤。您真是瞎了眼啦！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Can  it be his blood coming out?' murmured the abbe, as though putting the question  to himself. 'The strange thing is,' he added, looking at Julien, 'that the  Marquis knows you … How, I cannot say. He is giving you, to begin with, a  salary of one hundred louis. He is a man who acts only from caprice, that is  his weakness; he will outdo you in puerilities.If he is pleased with you, your  salary may rise in time to eight thousand francs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道这是血统的力量，”神甫低声说，像是自言自语。“奇怪的是，”他稍着于连，又说，“侯爵认识您……我不知道是怎么回事。开始他给您的薪水是一百路易，这个人做事全凭心血来潮，这是他的毛病；他会孩子似地跟您作对。如果他满意，您的薪水会长到八千法郎。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  you must be well aware,' the abbe went on in a harsh tone, 'that he is not  giving you all this money for your handsome face. You will have to be of use to  him. If I were in your position, I should speak as little as possible, and  above all, never speak of matters of which I know nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但是，您要清楚，”神甫又酸溜溜地说，“他给您这些钱，不是为了您那双漂亮眼睛。要是我，我就少说话，尤其是绝不说我不知道的事情。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!'  said the abbe, 'I have been making inquiries on your behalf; I was forgetting  M. de La Mole's family. He has two children, a daughter, and a son of nineteen,  the last word in elegance, a mad fellow, who never knows at one minute what he  will be doing the next. He has spirit, and courage; he has fought in Spain. The  Marquis hopes, I cannot say why, that you will become friends with the young  Comte Norbert. I have said that you are a great Latin scholar, perhaps he  reckons upon your teaching his son a few ready-made phrases about Cicero and  Virgil.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，”神甫说，“我替您打听了一些情况；我刚才忘了德·拉莫尔先生的家庭了。他有两个孩子，一个女儿，一个十九岁的儿子，极高雅，是那种中午还不知道下午两点钟干什么的疯子。他有才智，有勇气，在西班牙打过仗。我不知道为什么，侯爵希望您成为年轻的诺贝尔伯爵的朋友。我说过您精通拉丁文，也许他想让您教他儿子几句有关西塞罗和维吉尔的现成话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  your place, I should never allow this fine young man to make free with me; and,  before yielding to his overtures, which will be perfectly civil, but slightly  marred by irony, I should make him repeat them at least twice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要是我，我绝不让这位年轻人拿我开玩笑；他的主动接近会是彬彬有礼的，但稍许掺杂有嘲讽，我要是接受，就非让他重复好几遍不可。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall not conceal from you that the young Comte de La Mole is bound to look  down upon you at first, because of your humble birth. He is the direct  descendant of a courtier, who had the honour to have his head cut off on the  Place de Greve, on the 26th of April, 1574, for a political intrigue. As for  you, you are the son of a carpenter at Verrieres, and moreover, you are in his  father's pay. Weigh these differences carefully, and study the history of this  family in Moreri, all the flatterers who dine at their table make from time to  time what they call delicate allusions to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不瞒您，开始这位年轻人会看不起您，因为您不过是个小小平民而已。他的祖上曾在宫里走动，并且有幸因一次政治阴谋于一五七四年四月三十日在格莱沃广场被斩首。而您呢，您是维里埃的一个木匠的儿子，更有甚者，您是他父亲花钱雇来的。掂量掂量这些差别吧，到莫勒里的著作中研究研究这个家庭的历史吧；所有在他们家吃晚饭的清客都会不时地提到这些事，他们称之为微妙的影射。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Take  care how you respond to the pleasantries of M. le Comte Norbert de La Mole,  Squadron Commander of Hussars and a future Peer of France, and do not come and  complain to me afterwards.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您要注意如何回答诺贝尔·德·拉莫尔伯爵的玩笑，他是轻骑兵上尉和法国贵族院议员，不要事后跑到我这儿来诉苦。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  seems to me,' said Julien, blushing deeply, 'that I ought not even to answer a  man who looks down upon me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我觉得，”于连说，满脸通红，“我甚至无须回答一个看不起我的人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  have no idea of this form of contempt; it will reveal itself only in  exaggerated compliments. If you were a fool, you might let yourself be taken in  by them; if you wished to succeed, you ought to let yourself be taken in.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这种看不起您是看不出来的，表现出来的都是些夸张的恭维。如果您是个傻瓜，您就会上当；可您若想发迹，您还就得上当。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'On  the day when all this ceases to agree with me,' said Julien, 'shall I be  considered ungrateful if I return to my little cell, number 103?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“到了这一切对我不再适合的那一天，”于连说，“若是我回到我那第一０三号小房间里，我会被看作是一个忘恩负义的人吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No  doubt,' replied the abbe, 'all the sycophants of the house will slander you,  but then I shall appear. Adsum qui fed. I shall say that it was from me that  the decision came.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“毫无疑问，”神甫答道，“所有对这个家庭献殷勤的人，都会徘谤您的，不过，我会出面的。Adsum qui feci，我说这是我的决定。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was dismayed by the bitter and almost malicious tone which he remarked in M.  Pirard; this tone completely spoiled his last utterance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连注意到彼拉神甫的口吻是严厉的，近乎凶狠，感到很难过；这种口吻完全败坏了他最后的那一句话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  fact was that the abbe felt a scruple of conscience about loving Julien, and it  was with a sort of religious terror that he was thus directly interfering with  the destiny of another man.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>事实上，神甫因爱于连而感到良心不安，他是怀着某种宗教的恐惧如此直接地干预他人的命运啊。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  will also see,' he continued, with the same ill grace, and as though in the  performance of a painful duty, 'you will see Madame la Marquise de La Mole. She  is a tall, fair woman, pious, proud, perfectly civil and even more  insignificant. She is a daughter of the old Due de Chaulnes, so famous for his  aristocratic prejudices. This great lady is a sort of compendium, in high  relief, of all that makes up the character of the women of her rank. She makes  it no secret that to have had ancestors who went to the Crusades is the sole  advantage to which she attaches any importance.Money  comes only a long way after: does that surprise you? We are no longer in the  country, my friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您还会看见，”他又同样没好气地说，好像是在完成一个艰巨的任务，“您还会看见德·拉莫尔侯爵夫人。那是一个身材高大的金发女人，虔诚，高傲，礼貌周到，然而更加没有可取之处。她是因其贵族偏见而如此知名的德·肖纳老公爵的女儿。这位贵妇人是某种实际上造成她那个阶级的妇女的性格的那种东西的一个突出缩影。她并不隐瞒，有先人参加十字军东征乃是她敬重的唯一长处。金钱还远在其次：这使您感到惊讶吗？我们已不是在外省了，我的朋友。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  will find in her drawing-room many great noblemen speaking of our Princes in a  tone of singular disrespect. As for Madame de La Mole, she lowers her voice in  respect whenever she names a Prince, let alone a Princess. I should not advise  you to say in her hearing that Philip II or Henry VIII was a monster. They were  KINGS, and that gives them an in alienable right to the respect of everyone,  and above all to the respect of creatures without birth, like you and me.  However,' M. Pirard added, 'we are priests, for she will take you for one; on  that footing, she regards us as lackeys necessary to her salvation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您在她的客厅里会看见好几位大贵人，他们以一种奇怪的轻慢口吻谈论我们的亲王们。至于德·拉莫尔侯爵夫人，每当她提到一位亲王尤其是一位王妃的时候，总是出于尊敬而压低声音。我劝您不要在她面前说菲利普二世和亨利八世是怪物。他们当过国王，这就给了他们永不失效的权利享有众人的尊敬，尤其是享有出身卑微的你我等的尊敬。不过，”彼拉神甫补充说，“我们是教士，因为她当我们是教士；她因此而把我们当作获救所不可缺少的仆人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,'  said Julien, 'it seems to me that I shall not remain long in Paris.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，”于连说，“看来我在巴黎呆不长。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'As  you please; but observe that there is no hope of success, for a man of our  cloth, except through the great nobles. With that indefinable element (at  least, I cannot define it), which there is in your character, if you do not  succeed you will be persecuted; there is no middle way for you.Do  not abuse your position. People see that you are not pleased when they speak to  you; in a social environment like this, you are doomed to misfortune, if you do  not succeed in winning respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好极了，不过您要看到，我们这种穿僧衣的人要发迹就得靠那些大贵人。您的性格中有一种至少是我说不清楚的东西，这使您若不发迹就受迫害；您没有中间道路。别存幻想。别人看得出来，他们跟您说话并不能使您高兴；在这样一个重社交的地方，您若得不到尊敬，就必定要遭殃。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">

<p>'What  would have become of you at Besancon, but for this caprice on the part of the  Marquis de La Mole? One day, you will appreciate all the singularity of what he  is doing for you, and, if you are not a monster, you will feel eternal  gratitude to him and his family. How many poor abbes, cleverer men than you,  have lived for years in Paris, upon the fifteen sous for their mass and the ten  sous for their lectures in the Sorbonne! … Remember what I told you, last  winter, of the early years of that wretch, Cardinal Dubois. Are you, by any  chance, so proud as to imagine that you have more talent than he?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果没有德·拉莫尔侯爵的心血来潮，您在贝藏松会变成什么呢？有一天您会明白，他为您做的事情是多么不寻常，如果您不是一个没有心肝的人，您就会对他和他的家庭怀有永远的感激之情。多少可怜的神甫，他们比您有学问，却在巴黎生活多年，靠做弥撒挣的那十个苏和在索邦神学院辩论挣的那十五个苏！……想想去年冬天我跟您讲的红衣主教杜布瓦那个坏蛋的早年吧。难道您竟自负到自认比他还有才干吗？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I,  for example, a peaceable and insignificant man, expected to end my days in my  Seminary; I was childish enough to have grown attached to it. Very well! I was  going to be turned out when I offered my resignation.Do  you know what was the extent of my fortune? I had five hundred and twenty  francs of capital, neither more nor less; not a friend, at most two or three  acquaintances. M. de La Mole, whom I had never seen, saved me from disaster; he  had only to say the word, and I was given a living in which all my parishioners  are people in easy circumstances, above the common vices, and the stipend fills  me with shame, so far out of proportion is it to my work. I have spoken to you  at this length only to put a little ballast into that head of yours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“比方说我吧，我是个喜欢平静、才能平庸的人，本打算就在我的神学院里终老了，谁知竟幼稚到有了依恋之情。好吧！当我提出辞呈的时候，我已经快被撤职了。您知道当时我有多少财产吗？不多不少老本五百二十法郎；没有一个朋友，只有两、三个认识的人。德·拉莫尔先生把我从困境里解救出来，可我从未见过他；他只消一句话，人家就给了我一个本堂区，其居民都是些富裕的人，从没有粗俗的恶习，而我的收入令人惭愧，简直与我的工作不相称。我跟您说了这么久，就是为了让您的头脑清醒清醒。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  word more; it is my misfortune to have a hasty temper; it is possible that you  and I may cease to speak to one another.</p>

<p>“还有一句话：我这个人不幸生来暴躁，有可能你我之间不再说过话。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  the arrogance of the Marquise, or the mischievous pranks of her son, make the  house definitely insupportable to you, I advise you to finish your studies in  some Seminary thirty leagues from Paris, and in the North, rather than in the  South. You will find in the North more civilisation and fewer injustices; and,'  he added, lowering his voice, 'I must admit it, the proximity of the Parisian  newspapers makes the petty tyrants afraid.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>如果侯爵夫人的傲慢，或者她的儿子的恶意取笑，使这座房子变得对您来说确实不堪忍受，我劝您到 巴黎三十里外的那座神学院修完您的学业，往北去比往南好。北方有较多的文明和较少的不公。”他又压低声音补充说，“我应该承认，离巴黎的报纸近，那些小暴君有所畏惧。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  we continue to find pleasure in each other's company, and the Marquis's  household does not agree with you, I offer you a place as my vicar, and shall  divide the revenues of this living with you equally. I owe you this and more,'  he added, cutting short Julien's expressions of gratitude, 'for the singular  offer which you made me at Besancon. If, instead of five hundred and twenty  francs, I had had nothing, you would have saved me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>如果我们还高兴见面而侯爵的家对您又不合适了，我就把我的副本堂神甫的位置给您，这个本堂区的收入我和您对半分，这是我欠您的甚至还不够，”他打断了于连的感谢，又说，“因为在贝藏松您对我作出了那样不寻常的赠与。假使除了那五百二十法郎之外我一无所有的话，您就救了我啦。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  cruel tone had gone from the abbe's voice. To his great confusion, Julien felt  the tears start to his eyes; he was longing to fling himself into the arms of  his friend: he could not resist saying to him, with the most manly air that he  was capable of affecting:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫的口吻已经不那么严厉。于连感到十分羞愧的是他觉得眼泪居然上来了；他恨不得一下子投入他朋友的怀抱；他禁不住尽可能地装出男子汉的气概，对他说：</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have been hated by my father from the cradle; it was one of my great  misfortunes; but I shall no longer complain of fortune. I have found another  father in you, Sir.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我从小就遭到父亲的憎恨，这是我最大的不幸之一；但是我不会再抱怨命运了，我在您身上重新找到了一个父亲。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good,  good,' said the abbe, with embarrassment; then remembering most opportunely a  phrase from the vocabulary of a Director of a Seminary: 'You must never say  fortune, my child, always say Providence.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好，好”神甫窘迫地说，接着非常适时地来了一句神学院院 应该说的话，“任何时候都不应该说命运，我的孩子，永远要说天意。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  cab stopped; the drier lifted the bronze knocker on an immense door: it was the  HOTEL DE LA MOLE; and, so that the passerby might be left in no doubt of this,  the words were to be read on a slab of black marble over the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>出租马车停了，车夫拉起一扇巨大的铜门环：这是德、拉莫尔府；为了不使人起疑，这几个字在门上方的一块黑色大理石上赫然在目。</p>

<div class="left">

<p>This  affectation was not to Julien's liking. 'They are so afraid of the Jacobins!  They see a Robespierre and his tumbril behind every hedge; often they make one  die with laughing, and they advertise their house like this so that the mob  shall know it in the event of a rising, and sack it.' He communicated what was  in his mind to the Abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种装模作样让于连感到不快。“他们如此害怕雅各宾党人！他们在每一道篱笆后面都看见一个罗伯斯庇尔和他的押送死刑犯的车子：他们常常让人笑死，他们还这样张扬他们的房子，好让暴民们在发生骚乱时认出来，进行抢劫。”他把这一想法告诉了彼拉神甫。</p>

<p>'Ah!  Poor boy, you will soon be my vicar. What an appalling idea to come into your  head!'</p>
