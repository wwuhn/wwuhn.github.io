  <div class="left"><p>One  day Julien returned from the charming property of Villequier, on the bank of  the Seine, in which M. de La Mole took a special interest because, of all his  estates, it was the only one that had belonged to the celebrated Boniface de La  Mole. He found at the Hotel the Marquise and her daughter, who had returned  from Hyeres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一天，于连从塞纳河畔景色迷人的维尔基埃领地回来。德·拉莫尔先生对这块领地很关心，因为在他所有的领地中，只有这一块曾经属于著名的博尼法斯·德·拉莫尔。于连在府上看见了侯爵夫人和她的女儿，她们从耶尔回来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was now a dandy and understood the art of life in Paris. He greeted  Mademoiselle de La Mole with perfect coolness. He appeared to remember nothing  of the time when she asked him so gaily to tell her all about his way of  falling from his horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连现在已经成了个浪荡子，懂得了巴黎的生活艺术。他对德·拉莫尔小姐是十足的冷淡。她曾经那么快活地细细询问他如何从马上摔行来，看来那段光阴他一点几也不记得了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole found him taller and paler. There was no longer anything provincial  about his figure or his attire; not so with his conversation: this was still  perceptibly too serious, too positive. In spite of these sober qualities, and  thanks to his pride, it conveyed no sense of inferiority; one felt merely that  he still regarded too many things as important. But one saw that he was a man  who would stand by his word.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐发现他长高了，也苍白了。他的身材，他的仪表，毫无外行样儿了，但谈吐还不行：看得出来，严肃的东西太多，实在的东西太多。尽管有这朴爱讲道理的特点，因为他自尊，所以他的谈吐并没有下属的味道；大家只是觉得，他看得重要的事情仍嫌太多。不过，他们也看出来他是个言必有据的人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  is wanting in lightness of touch, but not in intelligence,' Mademoiselle de La  Mole said to her father, as she teased him over the Cross he had given Julien.  'My brother has been asking you for it for the last eighteen months, and he is  a La Mole!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他缺的是潇洒，不是机智，”德·拉莫尔小姐对他父亲说，同时拿他送给于连的勋章打趣。“哥哥跟您要了十八个月，这可是个拉莫尔家的人！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes;  but Julien has novelty. That has never been the case with the La Mole you  mention.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，但是于连有出人意料之举，这可是您跟我说的拉莫尔家的人从未有过的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  le Duc de Retz was announced.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>仆人通报德·雷斯公爵到。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  felt herself seized by an irresistible desire to yawn; she recognised the  antique decorations and the old frequenters of the paternal drawing-room. She  formed an entirely boring picture of the life she was going to resume in Paris.  And yet at Hyeres she had longed for Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德立刻觉得忍不住要打呵欠了，她仿佛看见了父亲客厅里古旧的金饰和常来的旧客。她想象出她在巴黎又要开始的那种百无聊赖的  生活了。可是，她在耶尔又怀念巴黎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  think that I am nineteen!' she reflected: 'it is the age of happiness,  according to all those gilt-edged idiots.' She looked at nine or ten volumes of  recent poetry that had accumulated, during her absence in Provence, on the  drawing-room table. It was her misfortune to have more intelligence than MM. de  Croisenois, de Caylus, de Luz, and the rest of her friends. She could imagine  everything that they would say to her about the beautiful sky in Provence,  poetry, the south, etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然而我十九岁了！”她想，“这是幸福的年龄，所有这些切口涂金的蠢东西都这么说。”她望着她在普罗旺斯旅行期间堆积在客厅墙边小桌上的新出版的诗集，有八到十本之多。她不幸比德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦，德·凯吕斯，德·吕兹诸先生及其他：一些朋友更有才智。她想象得出他们要说些什么，普罗旺斯美丽的天空呀，诗听，南方呀，等等，等等。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Those  lovely eyes, in which was revealed the most profound boredom, and, what was  worse still, a despair of finding any pleasure, came to rest upon Julien. At  any rate, he was not exactly like all the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这双如此美丽的眼睛，流露出最深沉的厌倦，更糟的是，流露出找不到快乐的绝望，最后停在了于连身上。“至少，他跟别人不完全一样。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monsieur  Sorel,' she said in that short, sharp voice, with nothing feminine about it,  which is used by young women of the highest rank, 'Monsieur Sorel, are you  coming to M. de Retz's ball tonight?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“索莱尔先生，”她说，是一种上流社会年轻女子常用的声音，轻快，短促，毫无女人味儿，“索莱尔先生，今晚您参加德·雷斯先生的舞会吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Mademoiselle,  I have not had the honour to be presented to M. le Duc.' (One would have said  that these words and the title burned the lips of the proud provincial.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“小姐，我还没有被介绍给公爵先主的荣幸。”（简直可以说，这句话和这个头衔把骄傲的外省人的嘴剥了一层皮。）</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  has asked my brother to bring you; and, if you came, you could tell me all  about Villequier; there is some talk of our going there in the spring. I should  like to know whether the house is habitable, and if the country round it is as  pretty as people say. There are so many undeserved reputations!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他让我哥哥带您到他家去；再说，如果您去了，您还可以跟我谈谈维尔基埃领地的具体情况，春天我们要去。我想知道古堡能不能住，  附近是不是徐人说的那么漂亮。盗名窃誉的事多着哪！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  made no reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连不吭声。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Come  to the ball with my brother,' she added, in the driest of tones.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“跟我哥哥一块参加舞会吧，”她生硬地补了一句。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  made a respectful bow. 'So, even in the middle of a ball, I must render  accounts to all the members of the family. Am I not paid to be their man of  business?' In his ill-humour, he added: 'Heaven only knows whether what I tell  the daughter may not upset the plans of her father, and brother, and mother! It  is just like the court of a Sovereign Prince.One  is expected to be a complete nonentity, and at the same time give no one any  grounds for complaint.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连恭恭敬敬地鞠了一个躬。“这么说，就是在舞会上，我也得向这个家的所有成员汇报。我不是成了花钱雇来的代理人吗？”他情绪很  坏，又想，“谁知道我跟女儿说的会不会打乱父亲、哥哥、母亲的计划！这是一个真正的君主的宫廷。在这里，必须毫无用处，却又不让任何人有所抱怨。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  I dislike that great girl!' he thought, as he watched Mademoiselle de La Mole  cross the room, her mother having called her to introduce her to a number of  women visitors. 'She overdoes all the fashions, her gown is falling off her  shoulders… she is even paler than when she went away … What colourless hair, if  that is what they call golden! You would say the light shone through it. How  arrogant her way of bowing, of looking at people! What regal gestures!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个大个子站娘真叫我不喜欢！”他想，一边看着她走开，她母亲叫她，要把她介绍给她的几个女友。“她过于时髦了，连衣裙掉到肩膀下……比旅行前还要苍白……什么样的头发啊，金黄得没了颜色！好像阳光都能通过去。那行礼的方式，那目光，多高傲！真真一副女王的作派！”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole had called her brother back, as he was leaving the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐叫住她哥哥，他正要离开客厅。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Comte  Norbert came up to Julien:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>诺贝尔伯爵走近于连，对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  dear Sorel,' he began, 'where would you like me to call for you at midnight for  M. de Retz's ball? He told me particularly to bring you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我亲爱的索莱尔，您想我午夜到哪里去接您参加德·雷斯先生的舞会？他特意要我把您带去。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  know to whom I am indebted for such kindness,' replied Julien, bowing to the  ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我很清楚多亏了谁我才受到如此厚爱，”他回答，深深地鞠了一躬。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His ill humour, having no fault to find  with the tone of politeness, indeed of personal interest, in which Norbert had  addressed him, vented itself upon the reply which he himself had made to this  friendly speech.He  detected a trace of servility in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>诺贝尔跟他说话的口气很礼貌，甚至很关切，无可挑剔，于连的恶劣情绪就发泄在对那句很客气的话的回答中。他觉得里面有一种卑躬屈膝的味道。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  night, on arriving at the ball, he was struck by the magnificence of the Hotel  de Retz. The courtyard was covered with an immense crimson awning patterned  with golden stars: nothing could have been more elegant. Beneath this awning,  the court was transformed into a grove of orange trees and oleanders in  blossom. As their tubs had been carefully buried at a sufficient depth, these  oleanders and orange trees seemed to be springing from the ground. The carriage  drive had been sprinkled with sand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，来到舞会，德·雷斯府的豪华使于连感到震惊。入门的院子里，张着金星点点的深红色斜纹布大帐，再雅致不过。帐下，庭院变成了一片橙林和夹竹桃林。花盆仔细地埋在地下，不露痕迹，夹竹桃和橙树如地里长出的一般。车子经过的路上铺了沙子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  general effect seemed extraordinary to our provincial. He had no idea that such  magnificence could exist; in an instant his imagination had taken wings and  flown a thousand leagues away from ill humour. In the carriage, on their way to  the ball, Norbert had been happy, and he had seen everything in dark colours;  as soon as they entered the courtyard their moods were reversed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在我们的外省人眼里，整个这一切都不同凡响。他想不到会有如此的豪华，转眼间，他的想象高扬，离开恶劣的情绪十万八千里了。在来舞会的车子里，诺贝尔兴致勃勃，而他则满眼一团漆黑；一进院，角色就来了个大调换。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Norbert  was conscious only of certain details, which, in the midst of all this  magnificence, had been overlooked. He reckoned up the cost of everything, and  as he arrived at a high total, Julien remarked that he appeared almost jealous  of the outlay and began to sulk.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>诺贝尔只注意到几处细小的地方，在如此的豪华中，竟被忽略了。他估算着每一件东西的费用，算到了一个很高的总数，这时于连注意到他流露出近乎嫉妒的神色，情绪也变坏了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for Julien, he arrived spellbound with admiration, and almost timid with excess  of emotion in the first of the saloons in which the company were dancing.  Everyone was making for the door of the second room, and the throng was so  great that he found it impossible to move.This  great saloon was decorated to represent the Alhambra of Granada.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>而他呢，他进入里面正在跳舞的头一间客厅，立刻被迷住，赞叹不已，几乎因激动而胆怯起来。大家挤在第二间客厅门口，人多得无法往前走。第二间客厅的装饰活脱脱一个阿尔汗布拉宫。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  is the belle of the ball, no doubt about it,' said a young man with moustaches,  whose shoulder dug into Julien's chest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“应该承认，她是舞会的王后，”一个留小胡子的年轻人说，他的肩膀正顶着于连的胸口。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Mademoiselle  Fourmont, who has been the reigning beauty all winter,' his companion rejoined,  'sees that she must now take the second place: look how strangely she is  frowning.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“福尔蒙小姐整个冬季一直是最漂亮的，”旁边一个人答道，“如今发现自己已退居第二位，看她那神情多奇怪。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indeed  she is hoisting all her canvas to attract. Look, look at that gracious smile as  soon as she steps into the middle in that country dance. It is inimitable, upon  my honour.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真的，她竭尽全力想让人喜欢她。看，看她在四组舞中单独一个人时那微笑，多优雅。以名誉担保，这是千金难买的呀。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Mademoiselle  de La Mole has the air of being in full control of the pleasure she derives  from her triumph, of which she is very well aware.One  would say that she was afraid of attracting whoever speaks to her.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德·拉莫尔小姐看上去还能控制住胜利的喜悦，她清楚地意识到了她的胜利。她好像害怕跟她说话的人喜欢她似的。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Precisely!  That is the art of seduction.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“很好！这就是诱惑的艺术。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was making vain efforts to catch a glimpse of this seductive woman; seven or  eight men taller than himself prevented him from seeing her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连想看看这个迷人的女人，但是白费力气，七、八个比他高大的男子挡住了他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  is a good deal of coquetry in that noble reserve,' went on the young man with  the moustaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在这如此高贵的克制中确有些媚态，”留小胡子的年轻人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  those big blue eyes which droop so slowly just at the moment when one would say  they were going to give her away,' his companion added. 'Faith, she's a past  master.'</p>
</div>
<div
<p>“还有这双蓝色的大眼睛，正当似乎要流露内心的秘密时，垂下了，垂得那么慢，”旁边那个人又说，“我可以保证，这可再机灵不过了  。”</p>
 class="right">

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Look  how common the fair Fourmont appears beside her,' said a third.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“看，站在她身旁，美丽的福尔蒙显得多么平常，”第三个人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  air of reserve is as much as to say: &quot;How charming I should make myself to  you, if you were the man that was worthy of me.&quot;'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这种克制的神情意思是：您若是配得上我的男人，我会给您多少柔情啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  who could be worthy of the sublime Mathilde?' said the first:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁能配得上崇高的玛蒂尔德呢？”第一个人说，“一位君王，英俊，有才智，身材匀称，战争中的英雄，至多二十岁。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Some  reigning Prince, handsome, clever, well made, a hero in battle, and aged twenty  at the most.''The  natural son of the Emperor of Russia, for whom, on the occasion of such a  marriage, a Kingdom would be created; or simply the Comte de Thaler, with his  air of a peasant in his Sunday clothes … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“俄国皇帝的私生子……为了这桩婚事，会给他建一个君主国；或者干脆就是德·塔莱尔伯爵，一副衣冠楚楚的农民相……”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  passage was now cleared, Julien was free to enter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>门口空了些，于连能进去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Since  she appears so remarkable in the eyes of these puppets, it is worth my while to  study her,' he thought. 'I shall understand what perfection means to these  people.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“既然在这些玩偶们的眼中她是那么出类拔萃，就值得我研究研究了，”他想。“我将知道什么是这些人心目中的完美。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  he was trying to catch her eye, Mathilde looked at him. 'Duty calls me,' Julien  said to himself, but his resentment was now confined to his expression.  Curiosity made him step forward with a pleasure which the low cut of the gown  on Mathilda's shoulders rapidly enhanced, in a manner, it must be admitted, by  no means flattering to his self-esteem.'Her  beauty has the charm of youth,' he thought. Five or six young men, among whom  Julien recognised those whom he had heard talking in the doorway, stood between  her and him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正当他睁大眼睛在找，玛蒂尔德看见了他。“我的责任在呼唤我，”于连对自己说；但这时他脸上的表情还残留着怒气。好奇心驱使他愉  快地往前走，那愉快因玛蒂尔德连衣裙掉在肩膀下很低的地方而迅速增加，说句实在话，增加之快于他的自尊心不大光彩。“她的美洋溢着青春的活力，”他想。在他和她之间，有五、六个年轻人，于连认出了刚才在门口说话的几位。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  can tell me, Sir, as you have been here all the winter,' she said to him, 'is  it not true that this is the prettiest ball of the season?' He made no answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您，先生，您整个冬季都在这儿，这舞会是本季最漂亮的舞会，不是吗？”他不回答。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  Coulon quadrille seems to me admirable; and the ladies are dancing it quite  perfectly.' The young men turned round to see who the fortunate person was who  was being thus pressed for an answer. It was not encouraging.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“库隆的这个四组舞我觉得很棒；那些夫人们也跳得好极了。”几个年轻人都转过头，看看那个幸福的男人究竟是谁，人家死活要他回答  。回答未免令人泄气。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should hardly be a good judge, Mademoiselle; I spend my time writing: this is  the first ball on such a scale that I have seen.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不会是个好的评判，小姐；我抄抄写写过日子，这么豪华的舞会我是头一回看到。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  moustached young men were shocked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>那些留小胡子的年轻人愤怒了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are a sage, Monsieur Sorel,' she went on with a more marked interest; 'you look  upon all these balls, all these parties, like a philosopher, like a Jean  Jacques Rousseau. These follies surprise you without tempting you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您是一位智者，索莱尔先生，”她又说，兴趣更加明显，“您像哲学家、像让－雅克·卢梭那样看这些舞会，这些庆典。这种种疯狂使  您感到惊奇，却诱惑不了您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  chance word had stifled Julien's imagination and banished every illusion from  his heart. His lips assumed an expression of disdain that was perhaps slightly  exaggerated.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个词儿一下子扑灭了于连的想象力，把一切幻想从他心中驱走。他的嘴角流露出轻蔑，也许夸张了些。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Jean  Jacques Rousseau,' he replied, 'is nothing but a fool in my eyes when he takes  it upon himself to criticise society; he did not understand it, and approached  it with the heart of an upstart flunkey.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让－雅克·卢梭，”她答道，“在我看来，当他竟敢评论上流社会时，不过是个傻瓜而已；他不了解上流社会，把一颗暴发的仆役的心  带了进去。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  wrote the Contrat Social,' said Mathilde in a tone of veneration.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他写了《社会契约论》，”玛蒂尔德用崇敬的口气说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  all his preaching a Republic and the overthrow of monarchical titles, the  upstart is mad with joy if a Duke alters the course of his after dinner stroll  to accompany one of his friends.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个暴发户一边鼓吹建立共和、推翻君权，一边又因一位公爵饭后散步改变方向陪伴他的朋友而喜不自胜。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  yes! The Due de Luxembourg at Montmorency accompanies a M. Coindet on the road  to Paris,' replied Mademoiselle de La Mole with the impetuous delight of a  first enjoyment of pedantry. She was overjoyed at her own learning, almost like  the Academician who discovered the existence of King Feretrius. Julien's eye remained  penetrating and stern.Mathilde  had felt a momentary enthusiasm; her partner's coldness disconcerted her  profoundly. She was all the more astonished inasmuch as it was she who was in  the habit of producing this effect upon other people</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！是的，德·卢森堡公爵在蒙特朗西陪着一位库安代先生朝巴黎方向……”德·拉莫尔小姐说，初次尝到了卖弄学问的乐趣和快意。  她陶醉于自己的学问，几乎跟发现费雷特里乌斯国王的存在的那位院士差不多了。于连的目光一直尖锐，严厉。玛蒂尔德的兴奋很快消失，对手的冷淡使她深感困惑。她尤其感到惊讶的是，原本是她惯于在别人身上造成这种结果。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  that moment, the Marquis de Croisenois advanced eagerly towards Mademoiselle de  La Mole. He stopped for a moment within a few feet of her, unable to approach  her on account of the crowd. He looked at her, with a smile at the obstacle.  The young Marquise de Rouvray was close beside him; she was a cousin of  Mathilde. She gave her arm to her husband, who had been married for only a  fortnight. The Marquis de Rouvray, who was quite young also, showed all that  fatuous love which seizes a man, who having made a 'suitable' marriage entirely  arranged by the family lawyers, finds that he has a perfectly charming spouse.  M. de Rouvray would be a Duke on the death of an uncle of advanced years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这时，德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦候爵正急忙朝德·拉莫尔小姐走过来。人多，挤不过来，他在离她三步远的地方站了一会儿。他望着她，对眼前的障碍笑笑。年轻的德·鲁弗莱侯爵夫人在他旁边，她是玛蒂尔德的表姐妹。她的胳膊由才结婚半个月的丈夫挽着。德·鲁弗莱侯爵也极年轻，他怀有一种幼稚的爱情，此种爱情能让一个人结一门由公证人一手安排的门当户对的亲事，而又觉得那女人美丽无比。德·鲁弗莱先生等年纪很大的伯父一死，就可以当公爵。</p>
</div></div>

<p>While  the Marquis de Croisenois, unable to penetrate the throng, stood gazing at Mathilde  with a smiling air, she allowed her large, sky blue eyes to rest upon him and  his neighbours. 'What could be duller,' she said to herself, 'than all that  group! Look at Croisenois who hopes to marry me; he is nice and polite, he has  perfect manners like M. de Rouvray. If they did not bore me, these gentlemen  would be quite charming.He,  too, will come to balls with me with that smug, satisfied air. A year after we  are married, my carriage, my horses, my gowns, my country house twenty leagues  from Paris, everything will be as perfect as possible, just what is needed to  make an upstart burst with envy, a Comtesse de Roiville for instance; and after  that?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵无法穿过人群，只好笑盈盈地望着玛蒂尔德，这时，她那天蓝色的大眼睛停在他和他周围的人的身上。“还有比这伙人更平庸的吗！”她心里说，“这个克鲁瓦泽努瓦还想娶我；他温柔，礼貌，像德·鲁弗莱先生一样举止文雅。这些先生要是不令人厌倦的话，倒是很可爱的，他将来也会带着狭隘、自得的神情跟着我参加舞会的。结婚一年之后，我的车，我的马，我的裙子，我的离巴黎二十里远的别墅，这一切都会尽善尽美，完全可以论一个暴发户，例如德·鲁瓦维尔伯爵夫人因嫉妒而送命；可是以后呢？……”</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  let her mind drift into the future. The Marquis de Croisenois succeeded in  reaching her, and spoke to her, but she dreamed on without listening. The sound  of his voice was lost in the hubbub of the ball. Her eye mechanically followed  Julien, who had moved away with a respectful, but proud and discontented air.  She saw in a corner, aloof from the moving crowd, Conte Altamira, who was under  sentence of death in his own country, as the reader already knows. Under Louis  XIV,a lady of his family had married a Prince de Conti; this antecedent  protected him to some extent from the police of the Congregation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>玛蒂尔德在想象中先已厌倦了。德·克移瓦泽努瓦终于走到她身边，跟她说话，可她还在作梦，没有听。对于她，他的说话声和舞会的嘈杂声混在一起了。她的目光机械地跟着于连，他已走开，神情是毕恭毕敬的，但是自豪，不满。她在远离穿流的人群的一个角落里看见了阿尔塔米拉伯爵，就是在自己的国家被判死刑的那位，读者已经认识。在路易十四治下，他的一位亲戚嫁给了一位孔蒂家的亲王；这段往事多少保护着他，免遭圣会的警察迫害。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  can see nothing but a sentence of death that distinguishes a man,'thought  Mathilde: 'it is the only thing that is not to be bought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我看见的只是死刑判决使一个人与众不同，”玛蒂尔德想，“这是唯一不能买的东西。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  There is a witty saying that I have wasted on myself! What a pity that it did  not occur to me when I could have made the most of it!' Mathilde had too much  taste to lead up in conversation to a witticism prepared beforehand; but she  had also too much vanity not to be delighted with her own wit. An air of  happiness succeeded the appearance of boredom in her face. The Marquis de  Croisenois, who was still addressing her, thought he saw a chance of success,  and doubled his loquacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！我刚才对自己说的是一句俏皮话！真遗憾，它来的不是时候，没能让我出出风头！”玛蒂尔德口味太高，不肯在谈话中使用事先准  备好的俏皮话；但是她又太虚荣，不能不自鸣得意。她的脸上，幸福的神色于是取代了厌倦的表情。德·克鲁瓦泽劳瓦侯爵一直在说话，以为看见了成功，就更加喋喋不休了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  fault would anyone have to find with my remark?' Mathilde asked herself. 'I  should answer my critic: &quot;A title of Baron, or Viscount, that can be  bought; a Cross, that is given; my brother has just had one, what has he ever  done? A step in promotion, that is obtained. Ten years of garrison duty, or a  relative as Minister for War, and one becomes a squadron commander, like Norbert.  A great fortune! That is still the most difficult thing to secure, and  therefore the most meritorious. Now is not that odd? It is just the opposite to  what all the books say… Well, to secure a fortune, one marries M. Rothschild's  daughter.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一个坏蛋拿什么来反驳我的俏皮话呢？”玛蒂尔德心里说。“我会这样回答批评者：男爵的头衔，于爵的头衔，可以买到；一枚勋章，可以赠送；我哥哥就刚刚得到一枚，他做了什么？一个官阶，可以获得。住十年兵营，或有个亲戚当陆军部长，就能像诺贝尔一样当上骑兵上尉。一笔巨大的财产呢！……这仍旧是最难的，因而也最值得尊重。真奇怪，这跟书上讲的正好相反……好吧！为了财产，就娶罗特希尔德先生的女儿吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  remark is really subtle. A death sentence is still the only thing for which no  one has ever thought of asking.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的话的确有深度。死刑判决仍然是唯一无人敢申请的东西。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you know Conte Altamira?' she asked M. de Croisenois.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您认识阿尔塔米拉伯爵吗？”她同德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  had the air of having come back to earth from so remote an abstraction, and  this question bore so little relation to all that the poor Marquis had been  saying to her for the last five minutes, that his friendly feelings were  somewhat disconcerted. He was, however, a man of ready wit, and highly esteemed  in that capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她好像大梦方醒，这个问题和可怜的侯爵五分钟以来跟她说的话没什么关联，和蔼可亲的他不免感到难堪。不过，他是个机智的人，并以  机智而享盛名。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Mathilde  is certainly odd,' he thought; 'it is a drawback, but she gives her husband  such a splendid social position! I cannot think how the Marquis de La Mole  manages it; he is on intimate terms with the best people in every party, he is  a man who cannot fall. Besides, this oddity in Mathilde may pass for genius.  Given noble birth and an ample fortune, genius is not to be laughed at, and  then, what distinction! She has such a command, too, when she pleases, of that  combination of wit, character and aptness, which makes conversation perfect… '  As it is hard to do two things well at the same time, the Marquis answered  Mathilde with a vacant air, and as though repeating a lesson:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“玛蒂尔德挺古怪，”他想，“这是个缺点，然而她给她的丈夫一个多好的社会地位！我不知道这个德·拉莫尔侯爵是怎么搞的，他跟各党派的关系都好得不能再好，这是一个不倒翁啊。再说，玛蒂尔德的古怪可以被视为天才。有了高贵的出身，巨大的财产，天才不会惹人笑话，那时该是多么与众不同啊！还有，只要她愿意，她就能兼有才华、个性和急智，这使她变得十分可爱……”由于一心不可二用，侯爵回答玛蒂尔德时神情恍惚，如同背书：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  does not know poor Altamira?' and he told her the story of the absurd, abortive  conspiracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁不认识这个可怜的阿尔塔米拉？”接着他给她讲那桩失败的阴谋，可笑，荒唐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Most  absurd!' said Mathilde, as though speaking to herself, 'but he has done  something. I wish to see a man; bring him to me,' she said to the Marquis, who  was deeply shocked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“很荒唐！”玛蒂尔德好像自言自语，“然而他行动了。我想见见一位男于汉，把他领到我这儿来，”她对侯爵说，侯爵颇不快。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Conte  Altamira was one of the most openly professed admirers of the haughty and  almost impertinent air of Mademoiselle de La Mole; she was, according to him,  one of the loveliest creatures in Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>阿尔塔米拉伯爵也是一个最公开地赞美德·拉莫尔小姐的高傲、近乎放肆的神情的人，他认为她是全巴黎最美丽的人儿之一。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  beautiful she would be on a throne!' he said to M. de Croisenois, and made no  difficulty about allowing himself to be led to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她要是坐在王位上该多美！”他对德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生说，痛痛快快地跟他走了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  are not wanting in society people who seek to establish the principle that  nothing is in such bad tone as a conspiracy; it reeks of Jacobinism. And what  can be more vile than an unsuccessful Jacobin?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>上流社会中有不少人想证明，没有什么事情比阴谋更有伤风雅，那有一种雅各宾党的气味。还有什么比不成功的雅各宾分子更丑恶呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde's  glance derided Altamira's Liberalism to M. de Croisenois, but she listened to  him with pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德的眼神和德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生一起嘲笑阿尔塔米拉的自由主义，但是她听得仍然饶有兴味。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'A  conspirator at a ball, it is a charming contrast,' she thought. In this  conspirator, with his black moustaches, she detected a resemblance to a lion in  repose; but she soon found that his mind had but one attitude: utility,  admiration for utility.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“舞会上来了个阴谋家，真是绝妙的对比，”她想。看着他的小黑胡子，她觉得颇像一头休息中的雄狮，但是她很快觉察到他脑子里只有  一个想法：功利，功利崇拜。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Excepting  only what might bring to his country Two Chamber government, the young Count  felt that nothing was worthy of his attention. He parted from Mathilde, the  most attractive person at the ball, with pleasure because he had seen a  Peruvian General enter the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>除了能给他的国家带来两院制政府的东西之外，年轻的伯爵认为什么都不值得他注意。他愉快地离开了玛蒂尔德，舞会上最有诱惑力的人儿，因为他看见一个秘鲁将军进来了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Despairing  of Europe, poor Altamira had been reduced to hoping that, when the States of  South America became strong and powerful, they might restore to Europe the  freedom which Mirabeau had sent to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>可怜的阿尔塔米拉对欧洲感到绝望，只好这样想：南美洲国家强大以后，它们可以把米拉波送去的自由再还给欧洲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  swarm of young men with moustaches had gathered round Mathilde. She had seen  quite well that Altamira was not attracted, and felt piqued by his desertion of  her; she saw his dark eye gleam as he spoke to the Peruvian General. Mademoiselle  de La Mole studied the young Frenchmen with that profound seriousness which  none of her rivals was able to imitate. 'Which of them,' she thought, 'could  ever be sentenced to death, even allowing him the most favourable conditions?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一群留小胡子的年轻人旋风似地拥到玛蒂尔德身边。她清楚地看到，阿尔塔米拉没有被迷住，对他的离去很主气；她看见他跟秘鲁将军说  话时，黑眼睛闪闪发亮。德·拉莫尔小姐望着这些年轻的法国人，那种深沉的严肃是她的任何一位竞争对手都无法模仿的。“他们中间，”她想，“谁甘愿被判处死刑，即便拥有一切有利的机会？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This singular gaze flattered those who had  little intelligence, but disturbed the rest. They feared the explosion of some  pointed witticism which it would be difficult to answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种古怪的目光让缺乏才智之辈受宠若惊，却使其他人惴惴不安。他们害怕她会冒出什么尖刻的话，让他们难以回答。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good  birth gives a man a hundred qualities the absence of which would offend me: I  see that in Julien's case,' thought Mathilde; 'but it destroys those qualities  of the spirit which make people be sentenced to death.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“高贵的出身给人上百种优点，要是没有我就会不舒服，于连的例子让我看到这一点，”玛蒂尔德想，“然而高贵的出身也会让能使人被  判处死刑的那些精神优点衰退。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At that moment someone remarked in her  hearing: 'That Conte Altamira is the second son of the Principe di San Nazaro  Pimentel; it was a Pimentel who attempted to save Conradin, beheaded in 1268.  They are one of the noblest families of Naples.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，她身边有人说：“这位阿尔塔米拉伯爵是桑·纳查罗－皮芒泰尔亲王的次子；从前有个皮芒泰尔家的人试图救出一二六八年被斩首的康拉丹。那是那不勒斯最高贵的家族之一。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There,'  Mathilde said to herself, 'is an excellent proof of my maxim:Good  birth destroys the strength of character without which people do not incur sentences of death.I  seem fated to go wrong this evening. Since I am only a woman like any other,  well, I must dance.' She yielded to the persistence of the Marquis de  Croisenois, who for the last hour had been pleading for a galop. To distract  her thoughts from her philosophical failure, Mathilde chose to be perfectly  bewitching; M. de Croisenois was in ecstasies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“瞧，”玛蒂尔德心里说，“这绝妙地证明了我的格言：高贵的出身剥夺了性格的力量，而没有性格的力量就不会被判处死刑！这么说，我今晚注定要胡说八道了。即然我只是个像别人一样的女人，那好吧！应该去跳舞。”她让步了，接受了德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵的请求，一个钟头以来他一直求她跳一次加洛普舞。为了摆脱哲理思考的不快，她想让自己变得十分地迷人，德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生不禁心花怒放。</p>

<p>This  page, written on July 25, 1830, was printed on August 4. (Publisher's note.)</p>


<p>—Le Rouge et le Noir was published in 1831. It was an order of July  25, 1830, dissolving the Chamber, which provoked the Revolution of the  following days, the abdication of Charles X, and the accession of Louis  Phillippe—C. K. S. M.  </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  not the dance, nor the desire to please one of the handsomest men at court,  nothing could distract Mathilde. She could not possibly have enjoyed a greater  triumph. She was the queen of the ball, she knew it, but she remained cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，跳舞，取悦于院子里最漂亮的男人之一的愿望，都不能驱散玛蒂尔德的烦恼。不可能取得更大的成功了。她是舞会的王后，她看得出来，不过她看得很淡。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a colourless life I shall lead with a creature like Croisenois,' she said to  herself, as he led her back to her place an hour later… 'What pleasure can  there be for me,' she went on sadly, 'if after an absence of six months, I do  not find any in a ball which is the envy of all the women in Paris? And  moreover I am surrounded by the homage of a society which could not conceivably  be more select. There is no plebeian element here except a few peers and a  Julien or two perhaps. And yet,' she added, with a growing melancholy, 'what  advantages has not fate bestowed on me! Birth, wealth, youth! Everything, alas,  but happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“跟一个克鲁瓦泽努瓦这样的人在一起，我将过一种多么平凡的生活啊！”一个小时后他把她送回到原来的座位上，她对自己说，“我有半年不在巴黎，如果在一个全巴黎的女人都渴望参加的舞会上还找不到快乐，那我的快乐又在哪里呢？”她又想，快快不乐，“再说，舞会上还有一群人的敬意包围着我，而这一群人，我想象不出还有更好的组成了。这里也许只有几个上议院议员和一、两个于连这样的人是平民。然而，”她越来越忧郁了，“有什么好处命运没有给我啊：声誉，财产、青春！唉！一切，除了幸福。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  most dubious of my advantages are those of which they have been telling me all  evening. Wit, I know I have, for obviously I frighten them all. If they venture  to broach a serious subject, after five minutes of conversation they all arrive  out of breath, and as though making a great discovery, at something which I  have been repeating to them for the last hour. I am beautiful, I have that  advantage for which Madame de Stael would have sacrificed everything, and yet  the fact remains that I am dying of boredom. Is there any reason why I should  be less bored when I have changed my name to that of the Marquis de Croisenois?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我得到的好处中，最可疑的，还是他们整个晚上向我说的那些。才智，我相信我有，因为我显然使他们所有的人都感到恐惧。如果他们敢谈一个严肃的主题，五分钟之后，他们就会兴奋得喘不过气来，仿佛在我一个钟头来不断重复的事情上有了重大发现似的。我是美丽的，为了我的这个长处，德·斯达尔夫人会牺牲一切的；然而我厌倦得要死，这是事实。是否有理由认为，我把我的姓换成德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵的姓，就会少一些厌倦呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'But,  Lord!' she added, almost in tears, 'is he not a perfect man? He is the  masterpiece of the education of the age; one cannot look at him without his  thinking of something pleasant, and even clever, to say to one; he is brave…  But that Sorel is a strange fellow,' she said to herself, and the look of gloom  in her eye gave place to a look of anger. 'I told him that I had something to  say to him, and he does not condescend to return!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是，我的天主！”她又想，几乎想哭，“他不是一个完美的人吗？这是本世纪教育的杰作；您只要朝他看看，他就会找出—句可爱的、甚至机智的话来对您说；他是勇敢的……这个索莱尔可真古怪，”她心里说，眼神里的忧郁变成了恼怒。“我事先说过有话要跟他讲，他居然不肯再露面！”
