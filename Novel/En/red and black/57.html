  <div class="left"><p>Thus  the idea of a Bishopric was for the first time blended with that of Julien in  the head of a woman who sooner or later would be distributing the best  positions in the Church of France. This prospect would have made little  difference to him; for the moment, his thoughts rose to nothing that was alien  to his present misery: everything intensified it; for instance the sight of his  bedroom had become intolerable to him. At night, when he came upstairs with his  candle, each piece of furniture, every little ornament seemed to acquire the  power of speech to inform him harshly of some fresh detail of his misery.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>就这样，主教职位和于连，第—次在这个女人的头脑中联系在一起了，她迟早要分配法国教会里最好的职位。这种好处不大会让于连动心；此时此刻，他的心思用不到那些跟他眼下的不幸无关的事情上去：一切都加重了他的不幸，例如，看见自己的卧室，就让他受不了，晚上，当他端着蜡烛回来，每一件家具，每一种小饰物，都像是开口说话，尖刻地宣布他的不幸的新细节。</p>

<p>This  evening, 'I am a galley slave,' he said to himself, as he entered it, with a  vivacity long unfamiliar to him: 'let us hope that the second letter will be as  boring as the first.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“今天，我还有—件苦活儿，”他回房时对自已说，并且带着一种久违多时的欢快口气，“希望这第二封信和第一封一样乏味。”</p>
　　

　　

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was even more so. What he was copying seemed to him so absurd that he began to  transcribe it line for line, without a thought of the meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>果然，它比第—封还要乏味。他觉得他抄的东西那么荒唐，到后来就一行行写下去，根本不想是什么意思。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is even more emphatic,' he said to himself, 'than the official documents of the  Treaty of Muenster, which my tutor in diplomacy made me copy out in London.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这比我在伦敦时外交老师让我抄写的闵斯特尔条约的正式文献还要夸张，”他对自己说。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was only then that he remembered the letters from Madame de Fervaques, the  originals of which he had forgotten to restore to the grave Spaniard, Don Diego  Bustos. He searched for them; they were really almost as fantastic a rigmarole  as those of the young Russian gentleman.They  were completely vague. They expressed everything and nothing. 'It is the  Aeolian harp of style,' thought Julien. 'Amid the most lofty thoughts about  annihilation, death, the infinite, etc., I can see no reality save a shocking  fear of ridicule.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这时，他才想起德·费瓦克夫人的那几封信，他忘了还给那个庄重的西班牙人唐·迭戈·比斯托斯。他找出来。果然和那个年轻的俄国贵  族的信几乎一样地不知所云，模棱两可，空洞无物，什么都想说，末了什么也没说，“这种风格真是一把风吹琴，”于连想，“在这种关于虚无、死亡、无限之类的玄想中，我看害怕被人取笑这种可恶的心理才是真实的。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  monologue which we have here abridged was repeated nightly for a fortnight.  Falling asleep while transcribing a sort of commentary on the Apocalypse, going  next day to deliver a letter with a melancholy air,leaving his horse in the  stable yard with the hope of catching a glimpse of Mathilde's gown, working,  putting in an appearance in the evening at the Opera when Madame de Fervaques  did not come to the Hotel de La Mole; such were the monotonous events of Julien's  existence. They became more interesting when Madame de Fervaques paid a visit  to the Marquise; then he could steal a glance at Mathilde's eyes beneath the  side of the Marechale's hat, and would wax eloquent. His picturesque and  sentimental phrases began to assume a turn at once more striking and more  elegant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>经过我们删节的这种独白连续地被重复了两个礼拜。抄着类似《启示录》注释的东西酣然入睡，第二天神情忧郁地去送信，把马送回马厩时希望看见玛蒂尔德的裙子，工作，晚上要是德·费瓦克夫人不来德·拉莫尔府，他就去歌剧院，这就是于连生活中单调乏味的一件件大事。要是德·责庄克夫人来侯爵夫人家，他的生活就比较有趣了；他可以从元帅夫人帽子底下偷看玛蒂尔德的眼睛，说起话来也滔滔不绝。他那些别致而感伤的句子开始具有一种更动人、更高雅的结构。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was fully aware that what he was saying seemed absurd to Mathilde, but he  sought to impress her by the elegance of his diction. 'The falser the things I  say, the more I ought to appeal to her,' thought Julien;and then, with a  shocking boldness, he began to exaggerate certain aspects of nature. He very  soon perceived that, if he were not to appear vulgar in the eyes of the  Marechale, he must above all avoid any simple or reasonable idea. He continued  on these lines, or abridged his amplifications according as he read success or  indifference in the eyes of the two great ladies to whom he must appeal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他清楚地感觉到，在玛蒂尔德看来，他说的那些东西都是荒谬绝伦的，然而他想以措辞的高雅来打动她。“我说的东西越虚假，我越应该讨她喜欢，”于连想；于是，他肆无忌惮地夸大自然的某些方面。他很快发现，为了在元帅夫人眼中不显庸俗，尤其应该避免简单而合理的思想。他或者这样继续说下去，或者缩短他的夸夸其谈，全凭他在必须讨好的两位贵妇眼中看到的是成功还是冷淡。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the whole, his life was less horrible than at the time when his days passed in  inaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>总之，他的生活不像在无所作为中度日那么可怕了。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But,'  he said to himself one evening, 'here I am transcribing the fifteenth of these  abominable dissertations; the first fourteen have been faithfully delivered to  the Marechale's Swiss. I shall soon have the honour of filling all the  pigeonholes in her desk. And yet she treats me exactly as though I were not  writing! What can be the end of all this? Can my constancy bore her as much as  it bores me? I am bound to say that this Russian, Korasoff's friend, who was in  love with the fair Quakeress of Richmond, must have been a terrible fellow in  his day; no one could be more deadly.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“可是，”一天晚上，他对自己说，“我现在已在抄第十五封了，前十四封都准确无误地交给了元帅夫人的卫士了。我快荣幸地塞满她那  书桌的所有抽屉了。然而她对待我就像我根本没有写过信一样！这一切会有什么样的结局呢？我的坚持不懈会不会让她跟我一样地感到厌烦呢？应该承认，科拉索夫的朋友，热恋里奇蒙的美丽的贵格会女教徒的那个俄国人，当时一定是个可怕的人；没有人比他更讨厌了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Like  everyone of inferior intelligence whom chance brings into touch with the  operations of a great general, Julien understood nothing of the attack launched  by the young Russian upon the heart of the fair English maid. The first forty  letters were intended only to make her pardon his boldness in writing. It was  necessary to make this gentle person, who perhaps was vastly bored, form the  habit of receiving letters that were perhaps a trifle less insipid than her  everyday life.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正如常人偶然后见一员大将在指挥作战，于连根本不懂年轻的俄国人对美丽的英国女人的心灵展开的攻击。前四十封信只是请求原谅写信的冒昧。这个温柔的人儿也许感到无比烦闷，应该让她养成接到一些信的习惯，这些信也许比她的日常生活少一些平庸。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  morning, a letter was handed to Julien; he recognised the armorial bearings of  Madame de Fervaques, and broke the seal with an eagerness which would have  seemed quite impossible to him a few days earlier: it was only an invitation to  dine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天早晨，于连收到—封信，他认出了德·费瓦克文人的纹章，您忙撕开封口，几天前他是绝不只能如此急切的：不过是一张晚餐的请柬。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  hastened to consult Prince Korasoff's instructions. Unfortunately, the young  Russian had chosen to be as frivolous as Dorat, just where he ought to have  been simple and intelligible; Julien could not discover the moral attitude  which he was supposed to adopt at the Marechale's table.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连跑去看科拉索夫亲王的指示。不幸的是，在原来应当简洁明了的地方，年轻的俄国人却想自己如多拉那样轻薄油滑；于连想不出他该在元帅夫人的晚宴上取什么样的道德立场。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  drawing-room was the last word in magnificence, gilded like the Galerie de  Diane in the Tuileries, with oil paintings in the panels. There were blank  spaces in these paintings, Julien learned later on that the subjects had seemed  hardly decent to the lady of the house, who had had the pictures corrected. 'A  moral age!' he thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>客厅极其富画堂皇，金光闪闪，一如杜伊勒里宫里狄安娜画廊，护壁板上挂着一些油画。画上有明显的涂抹痕迹。于连后来才知道，女主人觉得这些画的主题不甚雅观，遂命人加以修改。“好一个道德的世纪！”他想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  this drawing-room he remarked three of the gentlemen who had been present at  the drafting of the secret note. One of them, the Right Reverend Bishop of ——,  the Marechale's uncle, had the patronage of benefices, and, it was said, could  refuse nothing to his niece. 'What a vast stride I have made,' thought Julien,  with a melancholy smile, 'and how cold it leaves me! Here I am dining with the  famous Bishop of ——.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在客厅里，他注意到有三个人参加过秘密记录的起草。其中一位是德·某某主教大人，元帅夫人的叔父，他掌管教士的俸禄，据说对他这个侄女是有求必应。“我迈了多大的一步啊，”于连心想，不禁苦笑，“而这一步对我来说又是多么地无所谓！我现在跟有名的德·某某主教一起吃饭。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  dinner was indifferent and the conversation irritating. 'It is like the table  of contents of a dull book,' thought Julien. 'All the greatest subjects of  human thought are proudly displayed in it. Listen to it for three minutes, and  you ask yourself which is more striking, the emphasis of the speaker or his  shocking ignorance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚宴平平常常，谈话也让人不耐烦。“这是一本拙劣的书的目录，”于连想，“人类思想的所有最重大的主题都被洋洋自得地淡到了。听上三分钟，就会自问，占上风的究竟是言者的夸张呢，还是其可恶的无知。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  reader has doubtless forgotten that little man of letters, named Tanbeau, the  nephew of the Academician and an embryo professor, who, with his vile  calumnies, seemed to be employed in poisoning the drawing-room of the Hotel de  La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>读者大概已经忘了那个叫唐博的小文人，院士的侄儿，未来的教授，他似乎负责用卑劣的诽谤来毒化德·拉莫尔府上的客厅的空气。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was from this little man that Julien first gleaned the idea that it might well  be that Madame de Fervaques, while refraining from answering his letters,  looked with indulgence upon the sentiment that dictated them. The black heart  of M. Tanbeau was torn asunder by the thought of Julien's successes; but  inasmuch as, looking at it from another angle, a deserving man cannot, any more  than a fool, be in two places at once, 'if Sorel becomes the lover of the  sublime Marechale,' the future professor told himself, 'she will place him in  the Church in some advantageous manner, and I shall be rid of him at the Hotel  de La Mole.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连正是从这个小人那里第一次想到，德·费瓦克夫人不回他的信，却可能宽容地对待支配他写信的那种感情。想到于连的成功，唐博先  生那卑鄙的灵魂被撕裂了；然而另一方面，一个有才能的人跟一个傻瓜一样，没有分身之术，“如果索莱尔成为高尚的元帅夫人的情夫，”未来的教授心想，“她会把他安排在教会里的那个好位置上，而我就会在德·拉莫尔府里把他摆脱掉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  l'abbe Pirard also addressed long sermons to Julien on his successes at the  Hotel de Fervaques. There was a sectarian jealousy between the austere  Jansenist and the Jesuitical, regenerative and monarchical drawing-room of the  virtuous Marechale.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫先生也为于连在德·费瓦克府上取得的成功，大大训斥了他一番。在严峻的詹森派教徒和道德高尚的元帅夫人的追求风气改良和巩固王政的耶稣会的客厅之间，存在着一种宗派的嫉妒。
