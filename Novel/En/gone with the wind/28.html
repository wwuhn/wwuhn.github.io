  <div class="left">COLD WEATHER set in abruptly with a killing frost Chilling winds swept beneath the doorsills and rattled the loose windowpanes with a monotonous tinkling sound. The last of the leaves fell from the bare trees and only the pines stood clothed, black and cold against pale skies. The rutted red roads were frozen to flintiness and hunger rode the winds through Georgia.</div>
  <div class="right">一旦霜冻来临，严寒天气便突然出现了。冷风从门槛下侵进屋里，把松劲的窗玻璃刮得格格地响个不停。树枝上光秃秃的连最后一片叶子也掉落了，只有松树照常苍翠，挺立在那里，衬印着灰沉沉的天空。满是车辙的红土大道冻得像火石一样坚硬，饥饿乘着寒风在肆虐着整个佐治亚州。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett recalled bitterly her conversation with Grandma Fontaine. On that afternoon two months ago, which now seemed years in the past, she had told the old lady she had already known the worst which could possibly happen to her, and she had spoken from the bottom of her heart. Now that remark sounded like schoolgirl hyperbole. Before Sherman’s men came through Tara the second time, she had her small riches of food and money, she had neighbors more fortunate than she and she had the cotton which would tide her over until spring. Now the cotton was gone, the food was gone, the money was of no use to her, for there was no food to buy with it, and the neighbors were in worse plight than she. At least, she had the cow and the calf, a few shoats and the horse, and the neighbors had nothing but the little they had been able to hide in the woods and bury in the ground.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉心酸地记及方丹老太太跟她的那次谈话。两个月前的那天下午，现在仿佛已时隔多年，那时她告诉老太太，她已经经历了她可能碰的最坏处境，这是打心底里说出来的话。可现在回想起来，那简直是个女学生的夸大之辞，幼稚得很。在谢尔曼的部队第二次经过塔拉之前，她本已有了小小的一笔财富，包括食品和现金在内，同时还有几家比她幸运的邻居，有一些可以让她度过冬天的棉花。现在棉花烧光了，食品抢走了，金钱也因为买不到吃的而没有用武之地，而且几家邻居的处境比她更坏。至少她还有那头母牛和那只牛犊子，有几只小猪，以及那骑马，而邻居家除了藏在树林里和埋在地底下的那点东西，就什么也没了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Fairhill, the Tarleton home, was burned to the foundations, and Mrs. Tarleton and the four girls were existing in the overseer’s house. The Munroe house near Lovejoy was leveled too. The wooden wing of Mimosa had burned and only the thick resistant stucco of the main house and the frenzied work of the Fontaine women and their slaves with wet blankets and quilts had saved it The Calverts’ house had again been spared, due to the intercession of Hilton, the Yankee overseer, but there was not a head of livestock, not a fowl, not an ear of corn left on the place.
<p>At Tara and throughout the County, the problem was food. Most of the families had nothing at all but the remains of their yam crops and their peanuts and such game as they could catch in the woods. What they had, each shared with less fortunate friends, as they had done in more prosperous days. But the time soon came when there was nothing to share.</p>At Tara, they ate rabbit and possum and catfish, if Pork was lucky. On other days a small amount of milk, hickory nuts, roasted acorns and yams. They were always hungry. To Scarlett it seemed that at every turn she met outstretched hands, pleading eyes. The sight of them drove her almost to madness, for she was as hungry as they.
</div>
  <div class="right">塔尔顿家所在的费尔希尔农场被烧个精光，现在塔尔顿太太和四个姑娘只得住在监工的屋里。芒罗家在洛夫乔伊附近，现在也成了一片废墟。米莫萨农场的木板厢房也烧掉了，正屋全靠它厚厚的一层坚实灰泥，幸亏方丹家的妇女和奴隶们用湿毛毯和棉被拼命扑打，才被救下来。卡尔弗特家的房子由于那个北方佬监工希乐顿从中调停，总算又一次幸免于难，不过那里已没有一头牲口、一只家禽和一粒玉米了。<p>在塔拉，甚至全县，目前的主要问题是食物。大多数家庭除了剩下未收的一点山芋花生，以及能在树林里抓到的一些猎物外，别无所有。他们剩下的这点东西也得跟那些更不幸的朋友们分享，就像在平时比较富裕的日子里那样。不过眼看就要没有东西可分享的了。如波克运气好捉得到的话，在塔拉他们能吃到野兔、负鼠和鲶鱼。</p>别的时候就只有少量的牛奶、山胡桃、炒橡子和山芋了。他们经常挨饿。思嘉觉得她动不动就遇到向她伸出的手和祈求的眼光。他们的这副模样逼得她快要发疯了，因为跟他们一样她自己也在饿肚子！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She ordered the calf killed, because he drank so much of the precious milk, and that night everyone ate so much fresh veal all of them were ill. She knew that she should kill one of the shoats but she put it off from day to day, hoping to raise them to maturity. They were so small. There would be so little of them to eat if they were killed now and so much more if they could be saved a little longer. Nightly she debated with Melanie the advisability of sending Pork abroad on the horse with some greenbacks to try to buy food. But the fear that the horse might be captured and the money taken from Pork deterred them. They did not know where the Yankees were. They might be a thousand miles away or only across the river. Once, Scarlett, in desperation, started to ride out herself to search for food, but the hysterical outbursts of the whole family fearful of the Yankees made her abandon the plan.</div>
  <div class="right">她命令把牛犊宰掉，因为它每天要吃掉那么多宝贵的牛奶。那天晚上人人都吃了过多的新鲜牛肉，结果都生病了。还得宰一只小猪，她知道，可是她一天天往后推，希望把猪崽养大了再说。猪崽还很小呢。要是现在就把它们宰了，那不会有什么好吃的，可是如果再过些时候，就会多得多了。每天晚上她都跟媚兰辩论，要不要打发波克骑马出去用联邦政府的钞票买些粮食回来。不过，由于害怕有人会把马掳去，把钱从波克手里他走。她们才没有下决心。她们不知道北方佬军队现在打到哪里了。他们可能远在千里之外，也可能近在河对岸。一回，思嘉实在急了，便准备自己骑马出门找吃的，可是全家人都生怕她碰上北方佬，这才迫使她放弃了自己的计划。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Pork foraged far, at times not coming home all night, and Scarlett did not ask him where he went. Sometimes he returned with game, sometimes with a few ears of corn, a bag of dried peas. Once he brought home a rooster which he said he found in the woods. The family ate it with relish but a sense of guilt, knowing very well Pork had stolen it, as he had stolen the peas and corn. One night soon after this, he tapped on Scarlett’s door long after the house was asleep and sheepishly exhibited a leg peppered with small shot. As she bandaged it for him, he explained awkwardly that when attempting to get into a hen coop at Fayetteville, he had been discovered. Scarlett did not ask whose hen coop but patted Pork’s shoulder gently, tears in her eyes. Negroes were provoking sometimes and stupid and lazy, but there was loyalty in them that money couldn’t buy, a feeling of oneness with their white folks which made them risk their lives to keep food on the table.</div>
  <div class="right">波克搜寻食物的范围很广，好几次整夜没有回家，思嘉也不问他到哪里去了。有时他带些猎物回来，有时带几个玉米棒子或一袋豌豆。有一次他带回来一只公鸡，说是在林子里捉到的。全家人吃得津津有味，但是觉得有些内疚，因为正像他偷豌豆和玉米一样，明明知道这是偷来的。就在第二天晚上，夜深人静时他来敲思嘉的门，露出一条受了严重枪伤的腿给她看。思嘉替他包扎时他很难为情地解释说，他在弗耶特维尔试图钻进一个鸡窝，结果被人家发现了。思嘉也没有追问那是谁家的鸡窝，只含泪轻轻拍了拍波克的肩膀。黑人有时让人生气，而且又蠢又懒，不过他有一颗用金钱也买不到的忠心，一种与白人主子一条心的感情，这驱使他们不惜冒生命危险去给一家人找吃的呢！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">In other days Pork’s pilferings would have been a serious matter, probably calling for a whipping. In other days she would have been forced at least to reprimand him severely. “Always remember, dear,” Ellen had said, “you are responsible for the moral as well as the physical welfare of the darkies God has entrusted to your care. You must realize that they are like children and must be guarded from themselves like children, and you must always set them a good example.”
<p>But now, Scarlett pushed that admonition into the back of her mind. That she was encouraging theft, and perhaps theft from people worse off than she, was no longer a matter for conscience. In fact the morals of the affair weighed lightly upon her. Instead of punishment or reproof, she only regretted he had been shot.</p>“You must be more careful, Pork. We don’t want to lose you. What would we do without you? You’ve been mighty good and faithful and when we get some money again, I’m going to buy you a big gold watch and engrave on it something out of the Bible. ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’ ”
</div>
  <div class="right">要是在原来，波克这种小偷小摸的行为就是一件严重的事了，说不定要吃一顿鞭子。要是在从前，思嘉就肯定会至少狠狠地责骂他一通。"你必须记住，亲爱的，"爱伦曾经说过，“对于那些由上帝托付给你照管的黑人，你在物质生活和道德两方面都是要负责的。你必须明白，他们就像小孩子一样管不住自己，你得防备他们误入歧途，而且你要随时随地给他们树立一个好的榜样。"<p>可现在思嘉把这番训诫完全抛到了脑后。现在她鼓励偷窃，哪怕是偷那些比她境况更坏的人家，并且毫不觉得这是违背良心的事了。事实上，那种为人处世的道德准则在思嘉心目中无足轻重。她决定不惩罚或者责备波克，反而为他的受伤感到遗憾。</p>“波克，你要更加小心。我们可是少不得你埃假如没有你，叫我们怎么办呀？你一直是一个很好，很完美、善良而忠实的人。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Pork beamed under the praise and gingerly rubbed his bandaged leg.
<p>“Dat soun’ mighty fine, Miss Scarlett. W’en you speckin’ ter git dat money?”</p>
“I don’t know, Pork, but I’m going to get it some time, somehow.” She bent on him an unseeing glance that was so passionately bitter he stirred uneasily, “Some day, when this war is over, I’m going to have lots of money, and when I do I’ll never be hungry or cold again. None of us will ever be hungry or cold. We’ll all wear fine clothes and have fried chicken every day and—”
</div>
  <div class="right">听了这句赞扬的话波克不禁眉飞色舞，小心地抚摩着那条包扎好了的腿。<p>“思嘉小姐，这话可说得太好了。你看什么时候会有那笔钱呢？"</p>“波克，我不知道，不过我总归会有的。"她俯身茫然地看了他一眼，那眼神热情而痛苦，波克被感动得很不自在了。“总有一天，这场战争一结束，我就会得到许多钱，那时我就该不会再挨饿受冻了。我们谁也不会挨饿受冻。我们人人都要穿得漂漂亮亮，每天都吃烤鸡，而且--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Then she stopped. The strictest rule at Tara, one which she herself had made and which she rigidly enforced, was that no one should ever talk of the fine meals they had eaten in the past or what they would eat now, if they had the opportunity.
<p>Pork slipped from the room as she remained staring moodily into the distance. In the old days, now dead and gone, life had been so complex, so full of intricate and complicated problems. There had been the problem of trying to win Ashley’s love and trying to keep a dozen other beaux dangling and unhappy. There had been small breaches of conduct to be concealed from her elders, jealous girls to be flouted or placated, styles of dresses and materials to be chosen, different coiffures to be tried and, oh, so many, many other matters to be decided! Now life was so amazingly simple. Now all that mattered was food enough to keep off starvation, clothing enough to prevent freezing and a roof overhead which did not leak too much.</p>It was during these days that Scarlett dreamed and dreamed again the nightmare which was to haunt her for years. It was always the same dream, the details never varied, but the terror of it mounted each time it came to her and the fear of experiencing it again troubled even her waking hours. She remembered so well the incidents of the day when she had first dreamed it.
</div>
  <div class="right">她没有继续说下去。因为塔拉农场有一条由思嘉自己制订和强迫执行的规矩，十分严格的规矩，那就是谁也不许谈他们以前吃得多么好，或者说如果有条件的话，今天想吃什么。<p>波克看见思嘉愣在那里瞪着眼睛出神，悄悄地便从房间里溜出来。在那早已消逝了的往年，生活曾是那么复杂，那么充满了彼此纠缠不清的问题。那时她一方面极力想赢得艾希礼的爱情，一方面又要维持那十来个围着她转，可又并不讨人喜欢的男朋友。还有些小错小过要设法瞒着大人，有些爱吃醋的姑娘要你去故意嘲弄或安慰；还要挑选不同式样的衣服和不同花色的料子，要试梳各式发型，等等。此外，还有许许多多的事要考虑决定。可现在，生活倒是简单极了。如今唯一重要的是得到足够的食物以免挨饿，有足够的衣裳以免受冻，还需要一个没有过多漏洞的屋顶来遮风蔽雨。</p>就是在这些日子里，思嘉开始接连做同一个恶梦，那是以后多年都要常常做的。这个梦的内容始终一成不变，但梦中的恐怖气氛却一次比一次更强，以致思嘉连醒着时也因为生怕再梦到它而十分苦恼。她很清楚地记得初次做这种梦那天所经历的意外遭遇。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Cold rain had fallen for days and the house was chill with drafts and dampness. The logs in the fireplace were wet and smoky and gave little heat. There had been nothing to eat except milk since breakfast, for the yams were exhausted and Pork’s snares and fishlines had yielded nothing. One of the shoats would have to be killed the next day if they were to eat at all. Strained and hungry faces, black and white, were staring at her, mutely asking her to provide food. She would have to risk losing the horse and send Pork out to buy something. And to make matters worse, Wade was ill with a sore throat and a raging fever and there was neither doctor nor medicine for him.
<p>Hungry, weary with watching her child, Scarlett left him to Melanie’s care for a while and lay down on her bed to nap. Her feet icy, she twisted and turned, unable to sleep, weighed down with fear and despair. Again and again, she thought: “What shall I do? Where shall I turn? Isn’t there anybody in the world who can help me?” Where had all the security of the world gone? Why wasn’t there someone, some strong wise person to take the burdens from her? She wasn’t made to carry them. She did not know how to carry them. And then she fell into an uneasy doze.</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">那时几天连续阴雨，屋里多处透风，又冷又潮湿。生炉子的木柴也是湿的，烟特别多，可是一点不暖和。吃过早餐后，除了牛奶就什么也没了，因为山芋已经吃完，波克打猎钓鱼也毫无所获。看来如果第二天他们还得吃东西，就只能宰一只小猪了。一张张板着的饥饿的面孔，无论黑的白的，都在瞪眼睛看她，默默地请她拿出食物来。她差一点冒丢掉那骑马的危险打发波克去买吃的了。更糟糕的是韦德嗓子痛，正发高烧，可是既没大夫，又买不到药来为他治疗.<p>思嘉久久地守着孩子，现在累了，肚子又饿，只得让媚兰照料一会，让自己倒在床上打个盹儿。她冻得双脚冰冷，害怕和绝望的心情又分外沉重，因此在床上翻来覆去睡不着。她反复思量：“我怎么办？我向哪里求援去？世界上还有人能帮助我吗？"世界的安全都到哪里去了呢？为什么就没有一个人，一个强大而聪明的人，能够替她挑起这副担子来呢？她不是生来就挑这副担子的呀。她不知怎么去挑它。想着想着，她进入了一种不安的微睡状态。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She was in a wild strange country so thick with swirling mist she could not see her hand before her face. The earth beneath her feet was uneasy. It was a haunted land, still with a terrible stillness, and she was lost in it, lost and terrified as a child in the night. She was bitterly cold and hungry and so fearful of what lurked in the mists about her that she tried to scream and could not. There were things in the fog reaching out fingers to pluck at her skirt, to drag her down into the uneasy quaking earth on which she stood, silent, relentless, spectral hands. Then, she knew that somewhere in the opaque gloom about her there was shelter, help, a heaven of refuge and warmth. But where was it? Could she reach it before the hands clutched her and dragged her down into the quicksands?</div>
  <div class="right">她来到一个荒凉古怪的地方，大雾弥漫，伸手不见五指。她脚下的地面摇晃不定，鬼怪时常出没，而且寂静得可怕；她迷了路，像黑夜里迷路和吓坏了的孩子似的。她又冷又饿，又很害怕浓烟中在她周围潜伏着的东西，因此很想大喊大叫，可是喊不出声来。迷雾中有什么怪物悄悄地伸出无情的双手，张开十指抓她的衣裙，要把她拖到她脚下正在震动的地底下去。后来，她知道周围一片模糊中有个什么地方，那里可以躲避，可以得到帮助，是个安全而温暖的天堂。但是它在哪里呢？在那双手抓住她拖到脚下的流沙中去之前她能够赶到达那里吗？</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Suddenly she was running, running through the mist like a mad thing, crying and screaming, throwing out her arms to clutch only empty air and wet mist Where was the haven? It eluded her but it was there, hidden, somewhere. If she could only reach it! If she could only reach it she would be safe! But terror was weakening her legs, hunger making her faint. She gave one despairing cry and awoke to find Melanie’s worried face above her and Melanie’s hand shaking her to wakefulness.
<p>The dream returned again and again, whenever she went to sleep with an empty stomach. And that was frequently enough. It so frightened her that she feared to sleep, although she feverishly told herself there was nothing in such a dream to be afraid of. There was nothing in a dream about fog to scare her so. Nothing at all—yet the thought of dropping off into that mist-filled country so terrified her she began sleeping with Melanie, who would wake her up when her moaning and twitching revealed that she was again in the clutch of the dream.</p>Under the strain she grew white and thin. The pretty roundness left her face, throwing her cheek bones into prominence, emphasizing her slanting green eyes and giving her the look of a prowling, hungry cat.
</div>
  <div class="right">她突然飞跑起来，发狂似地穿过密雾，呼喊着，尖叫着，伸出两只胳臂在空中乱抓，但那潮湿的雾中什么也抓不着。天堂在哪里啊？它躲避她，但的确在什么地方，只是看不见罢了。她要是能找到它就好了！要是找到了它，她就安全了！可是恐惧使她两腿发软，饥饿使她头脑发晕。她绝望地大叫一声醒过来，只见媚兰正焦急地俯身瞧着她，一边还在用手摇她，叫她完全清醒过来。<p>这个梦一再重复，每当她空着肚子睡觉就必然会梦见。它来得太频繁了。它使她害怕极了，以致常常不敢去睡觉，即使她真心实意地告诉自己，这样的梦实际上什么可怕的东西也没有。梦见雾，的确没有什么好叫她这样惊恐的。根本什么也没有--或许她一想起要陷到大雾弥漫的地方就害怕极了，结果只得和媚兰睡在一起了，因为只要她一开始在梦中哼哼挣扎，说明她又在受折磨了，媚兰就会把她摇醒。</p>在这种紧张心理的压迫下，她变得苍白和消瘦了。她脸上已失去圆乎乎的娇美轮廓，_n_乢__颧骨突了出来，使那双翘着眼角的绿眼睛显得更加触目，她也越发像只急于要抓到猎物的饿猫了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Daytime is enough like a nightmare without my dreaming things,” she thought desperately and began hoarding her daily ration to eat it just before she went to sleep.
<p>At Christmas time Frank Kennedy and a small troop from the commissary department jogged up to Tara on a futile hunt for grain and animals for the army. They were a ragged and ruffianly appearing crew, mounted on lame and heaving horses which obviously were in too bad condition to be used for more active service. Like their animals the men had been invalided out of the front-line forces and, except for Frank, all of them had an arm missing or an eye gone or stiffened joints. Most of them wore blue overcoats of captured Yankees and, for a brief instant of horror, those at Tara thought Sherman’s men had returned.</p>They stayed the night on the plantation, sleeping on the floor in the parlor, luxuriating as they stretched themselves on the velvet rug, for it had been weeks since they had slept under a roof or on anything softer than pine needles and hard earth. For all their dirty beards and tatters they were a well-bred crowd, full of pleasant small talk, jokes and compliments and very glad to be spending Christmas Eve in a big house, surrounded by pretty women as they had been accustomed to do in days long past. They refused to be serious about the war, told outrageous lies to make the girls laugh and brought to the bare and looted house the first lightness, the first hint of festivity it had known in many a day.
</div>
  <div class="right">“就是没有我梦见的那些东西，白天已冗长得像个恶梦了"，她怀着这样绝望的心情，开始每天把食物留到临睡前才去吃，看能不能减轻梦中可怖的程度。<p>弗兰克.肯尼迪在圣诞节期间，带着一支小小的队伍从征购部慢慢来到塔拉，他一路给军队搜集粮食和牲畜，但收获甚少，他们衣衫破烂，性情残暴，骑着又跛又乏，显然又派不上更大用场的马匹。就像这些牲口一样，他们自己也是从前线被淘汰下来的，而且除了弗兰克本人，都是些残废人，不是缺一条胳臂就是瞎了一只眼睛，或者关节僵直了，一瘸一拐的。他们大多穿着北军俘虏的蓝色上衣，所以一时间使塔拉的人大为惊慌，以为是谢尔曼的人又回来了。</p>他们那天晚上在农场过夜，躺在客厅地板上，垫着暖和的地毯美美地睡了一觉，因为他们已很久不在屋里过夜了，长期睡在松针堆里和硬邦邦的土地上。尽管他们满脸脏的胡子，一身的破衣烂衫，但却是些有教养的人，经常在愉快地闲谈，开玩笑，恭维别人，很高兴能在这大宅子里围着漂亮的女人过圣诞节，就像很久以前惯常过的那样。对战争他们不怎么认真，喜欢说些可怕的谎言来逗引姑娘们欢笑，给这所被洗劫一空的房子头一次带来轻松愉快的气氛，使它头一次接连好几天气有节日的气氛。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“It’s almost like the old days when we had house parties, isn’t it?” whispered Suellen happily to Scarlett. Suellen was raised to the skies by having a beau of her own in the house again and she could hardly take her eyes off Frank Kennedy. Scarlett was surprised to see that Suellen could be almost pretty, despite the thinness which had persisted since her illness. Her cheeks were flushed and there was a soft luminous look in her eyes.
<p>“She really must care about him,” thought Scarlett in contempt. “And I guess she’d be almost human if she ever had a husband of her own, even if her husband was old fuss-budget Frank.”</p>Carreen had brightened a little too, and some of the sleep-walking look left her eyes that night. She had found that one of the men had known Brent Tarleton and had been with him the day he was killed, and she promised herself a long private talk with him after supper.
</div>
  <div class="right">“这几乎像我们从前开家庭晚会的那些日子了，你说是吗？"苏伦高兴地小声对思嘉说。苏伦已经想入非非，觉得屋子里又有一个她的情人，那双眼睛始终盯着弗兰克.肯尼迪不离开。思嘉惊奇地发现居然漂亮起来了，尽管她那病后消瘦的容貌并没有完全改变。她的两颊上有了红晕，眼睛也在发光呢。<p>“她准是看上他了，"思嘉不屑地想。"我猜她要是有了丈夫，即使是弗兰克这样一个苛刻的人，她也很可能变得富于人情味的。"</p>卡琳也显得活泼了些，那天晚上连她眼神中的梦游症也完全消失了。她发现他们中间有个人认识布伦特.塔尔顿，并在布伦特牺牲的那天跟他在一起，因此她答应晚饭后同这个人单独进行一次长谈。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">At supper Melanie surprised them all by forcing herself out of her timidity and being almost vivacious. She laughed and joked and almost but not quite coquetted with a one-eyed soldier who gladly repaid her efforts with extravagant gallantries. Scarlett knew the effort this involved both mentally and physically, for Melanie suffered torments of shyness in the presence of anything male. Moreover she was far from well. She insisted she was strong and did more work even than Dilcey but Scarlett knew she was sick. When she lifted things her face went white and she had a way of sitting down suddenly after exertions, as if her legs would no longer support her. But tonight she, like Suellen and Carreen, was doing everything possible to make the soldiers enjoy their Christmas Eve. Scarlett alone took no pleasure in the guests.</div>
  <div class="right">吃晚饭时，媚兰强迫自己一反羞怯的常态，忽然变得活泼了，这叫大家十分惊讶。她又笑又乐，几乎在向一个独眼大兵卖弄风情，以致后者乐得用过分的殷勤回报她。思嘉很清楚，媚兰精神和生理两方面都勉强自己，因为她在任何男性的事情面前都是十分羞涩的。另外，她的身体还没有完全恢复。她坚持说自己很健康，甚至比迪尔茜还要做更多的事情，可是思嘉知道她实际上还着呢。每当她倒拿起什么东西时，脸色就要发白，而且用力过多就会突然坐下来，仿佛两腿支持不住似的。但是今天晚上她也像苏伦和卡琳那样，在尽可能使那些士兵过一个愉快的圣诞节。只有思嘉对这些客人不感兴趣。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The troop had added their ration of parched corn and side meat to the supper of dried peas, stewed dried apples and peanuts which Mammy set before them and they declared it was the best meal they had had in months. Scarlett watched them eat and she was uneasy. She not only begrudged them every mouthful they ate but she was on tenterhooks lest they discover somehow that Pork had slaughtered one of the shoats the day before. It now hung in the pantry and she had grimly promised her household that she would scratch out the eyes of anyone who mentioned the shoat to their guests or the presence of the dead pig’s sisters and brothers, safe in their pen in the swamp. These hungry men could devour the whole shoat at one meal and, if they knew of the live hogs, they could commandeer them for the army. She was alarmed, too, for the cow and the horse and wished they were hidden in the swamp, instead of tied in the woods at the bottom of the pasture. If the commissary took her stock, Tara could not possibly live through the winter. There would be no way of replacing them. As to what this army would eat, she did not care. Let the army feed the army—if it could. It was hard enough for her to feed her own.</div>
  <div class="right">嬷嬷做的晚餐有干豌豆、炖苹果干和花生，这些军人又加上他们自己怕炒玉米和腌猪肉，满满摆了一桌子，所以军人们说这是他们好几个月以来吃得最好的一顿饭了。思嘉瞧着他们吃，但心里很不舒服。她不但对于他们每吃一口都感到妒忌和吝啬，而且有点提心吊胆，生怕他们发现波克头天杀了一只小猪。小猪肉如今还挂在食品间，她已经警告过全家的人，谁要是对客人说了这件事或谈到关在沼泽地里的其他几只小猪，她就要把他的眼睛挖掉了。这些饿痨鬼会把整只小猪一顿就吃光的，而且如果知道还有几只活的，他们就会把它们征调走了。同时她也替那头母牛和那骑马担心，但愿当初把它们藏到了沼泽地里而不是拴在牧场那头的树林中。如果是征购队把她的牲口弄走了，塔拉农场就很可能过不了这个冬天。它们是没法取代的啊！她可管不着军队吃什么，要是军队有办法，就让他们自己供养自己好了。她要供养自己的一家已经够困难的了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The men added as dessert some “ramrod rolls” from their knapsacks, and this was the first time Scarlett had ever seen this Confederate article of diet about which there were almost as many jokes as about lice. They were charred spirals of what appeared to be wood. The men dared her to take a bite and, when she did, she discovered that beneath the smoke-blackened surface was unsalted corn bread. The soldiers mixed their ration of corn meal with water, and salt too when they could get it, wrapped the thick paste about their ramrods and roasted the mess over camp fires. It was as hard as rock candy and as tasteless as sawdust and after one bite Scarlett hastily handed it back amid roars of laughter. She met Melanie’s eyes and the same thought was plain in both faces. ... “How can they go on fighting if they have only this stuff to eat?”</div>
  <div class="right">那些军人又从自己的背包里取出一种叫做"通条卷子"的点心来，思嘉第一次看到这种联盟军的食品，它曾经像虱子一样引起过许多笑话呢。这是一种像木头似的烤焦了的螺旋形食品。他们鼓励她咬一口尝尝，她真的咬了一点，发现熏黑的表层下面原来是没放盐的玉米面包。士兵们把玉米面加水和好，有盐加点盐，然后把面团在通条上放到营火上烤，这就成了“通条卷子"。卷了像冰糖一样坚硬，像锯木屑屑似的毫无味道，所以思嘉咬了一口就在士兵们的哄笑声中还给了他们。她和媚兰相对而视，两人脸上的表情说明了同一个想法……“如果他们尽吃这种东西，怎么去打仗呀？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The meal was gay enough and even Gerald, presiding absently at the head of the table, managed to evoke from the back of his dim mind some of the manner of a host and an uncertain smile. The men talked, the women smiled and flattered—but Scarlett turning suddenly to Frank Kennedy to ask him news of Miss Pittypat, caught an expression on his face which made her forget what she intended to say.
<p>His eyes had left Suellen’s and were wandering about the room, to Gerald’s childlike puzzled eyes, to the floor, bare of rugs, to the mantelpiece denuded of its ornaments, the sagging springs and torn upholstery into which Yankee bayonets had ripped, the cracked mirror above the sideboard, the unfaded squares on the wall where pictures had hung before the looters came, the scant table service, the decently mended but old dresses of the girls, the flour sack which had been made into a kilt for Wade.</p>Frank was remembering the Tara he had known before the war and on his face was a hurt look, a look of tired impotent anger. He loved Suellen, liked her sisters, respected Gerald and had a genuine fondness for the plantation. Since Sherman had swept through Georgia, Frank had seen many appalling sights as he rode about the state trying to collect supplies, but nothing had gone to his heart as Tara did now. He wanted to do something for the O’Haras, especially Suellen, and there was nothing he could do. He was unconsciously wagging his whiskered head in pity and clicking his tongue against his teeth when Scarlett caught his eye. He saw the flame of indignant pride in them and he dropped his gaze quickly to his plate in embarrassment.
</div>
  <div class="right">这顿饭吃得非常愉快，连心不在焉地坐着首席的杰拉尔德，也居然设法从模糊的意识中搬来了一点当主人应有的礼貌和不可捉摸的笑容。那些军人兴高采烈地谈论着，妇女们也满脸微笑，百般讨好--这时思嘉突然扭过头去想询问弗兰克.肯尼迪关于皮蒂帕特小姐的消息，但她立即发现他脸上有种异的表情，这几乎使她把想要说的话都忘掉了。<p>原来弗兰克的目光已经离开苏伦的面孔，正在向房子里四顾张望，他有时看看杰拉尔德那双孩子般煌惑的眼睛，有时望着没铺地毯的地板，或者装饰品全部被拿走的壁炉，或者那些弹簧松了、垫子被北方佬用刺刀割开了的沙发，餐具柜上头被打碎的镜子，墙壁上原来挂相框的地方留下的方块，餐桌上的简陋餐具，姑娘的身上仔细补缀过的旧衣裳，以及已经给韦德入成苏格兰式短裙的那个面粉袋，等等。</p>弗兰克在回忆他战前熟悉的那个塔拉农场，脸上的表情是忧伤的、厌倦和无可奈何的愤怒交织在一块的。他爱苏伦，喜欢她的姐姐妹妹，敬重杰拉尔德，对农场也有真诚的好感。自从谢尔曼的部队扫荡了佐治亚州以后，他在这个州征集军需平时到处看到许多可怕的景象，可是从没有像现在塔拉农场这样使她深有感触。他要给奥哈拉一家尤其是苏伦做点事情，可是又毫无办法。他正无意识地摇头慨叹，啧啧不已时，忽然发现思嘉在盯着他。他看见思嘉眼睛里闪烁着愤愤不平和傲慢的神色，便感到十分尴尬，默默地垂下眼帘吃饭了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The girls were hungry for news. There had been no mail service since Atlanta fell, now four months past, and they were in complete ignorance as to where the Yankees were, how the Confederate Army was faring, what had happened to Atlanta and to old friends. Frank, whose work took him all over the section, was as good as a newspaper, better even, for he was kin to or knew almost everyone from Macon north to Atlanta, and he could supply bits of interesting personal gossip which the papers always omitted. To cover his embarrassment at being caught by Scarlett, he plunged hastily into a recital of news. The Confederates, he told them, had retaken Atlanta after Sherman marched out, but it was a valueless prize as Sherman had burned it completely.</div>
  <div class="right">因为亚特兰大陷落以来，邮路断绝已经四个月了。姑娘们渴望得到一点新闻。现在究竟北方佬到了哪里，联盟军部队打得怎么样，亚特兰大和老朋友们的情况如何，所有这些，她们都一无所知。弗兰克由于工作关系经常在这个地区到处跑动，无疑是个很好的信使，甚至比信使还要好，因为从梅肯以北直到亚特兰大，几乎每个人都跟他亲属关系或者认识他，他还能够提供一些有趣的私下传闻，而这些却常常被报纸删掉了。为了掩盖他遇到思嘉的眼光时那种尴尬局面，他乘机赶快谈起新闻来。他告诉她们，联盟军队已在谢尔曼撤出之后改变了亚特兰大，但是由于谢尔曼已经把它们彻底烧毁，这次收复也就没有什么意思了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“But I thought Atlanta burned the night I left,” cried Scarlett, bewildered. “I thought our boys burned it!”
<p>“Oh, no, Miss Scarlett!” cried Frank, shocked. “We’d never burn one of our own towns with our own folks in it! What you saw burning was the warehouses and the supplies we didn’t want the Yankees to capture and the foundries and the ammunition. But that was all. When Sherman took the town the houses and stores were standing there as pretty as you please. And he quartered his men in them.”</p>“But what happened to the people? Did he—did he kill them?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“但是我想亚特兰大是我离开那天晚上烧掉的，"思嘉有点迷惑不解地说。"我还以为那是我们的小伙子们烧的呢！"<p>“啊，不，思嘉小姐！"弗兰克吃惊地回答。“我们可没烧过我们自己人住的任何一个城镇！你看见烧的是我们不让落到北方佬手中的那些仓库和军需品，以及兵工厂和弹药。仅此而已。谢尔曼占领城市时，那些住宅和店铺都还是好好儿的，他的军队就驻扎在里面呢。"</p>“可人们怎么样了？他--他杀过人吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“He killed some—but not with bullets,” said the one-eyed soldier grimly. “Soon’s he marched into Atlanta he told the mayor that all the people in town would have to move out, every living soul. And there were plenty of old folks that couldn’t stand the trip and sick folks that ought not to have been moved and ladies who were—well, ladies who hadn’t ought to be moved either. And he moved them out in the biggest rainstorm you ever saw, hundreds and hundreds of them, and dumped them in the woods near Rough and Ready and sent word to General Hood to come and get them. And a plenty of the folks died of pneumonia and not being able to stand that sort of treatment.”
<p>“Oh, but why did he do that? They couldn’t have done him any harm,” cried Melanie.</p>“He said he wanted the town to rest his men and horses in,” said Frank. “And he rested them there till the middle of November and then he lit out. And he set fire to the whole town when he left and burned everything.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“他杀了一些，但不是用枪打死的。"那个独眼大兵冷冷地___说。他一开进亚特兰大就告诉市长，城里所有的人都得搬走，一个活人也不让留下。那时有许多老人经不起奔波，有许多病人不应当移动，还有小姐太太们，她们--她们也是不该移动的。结果他在罕见的狂风暴雨中把他们成百上千地赶出城外，将他们扔在拉甫雷迪附近的树林里，然后捎信给胡德将军，叫他来把他们领走。有许多人经不起那种虐待，都患肺炎死了。<p>“唔，他们对他不会有什么害处嘛，他干吗要这样呢？"媚兰大声嚷道。</p>“他说他要让他的人马在城里休整，"弗兰克说，"他让他们在城里一直休息到１１月中，然后才撤走。临走时他在全城纵火，把一切都烧光了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, surely not everything!” cried the girls in dismay.
<p>It was inconceivable that the bustling town they knew, so full of people, so crowded with soldiers, was gone. All the lovely homes beneath shady trees, all the big stores and the fine hotels—surely they couldn’t be gone! Melanie seemed ready to burst into tears, for she had been born there and knew no other home. Scarlett’s heart sank because she had come to love the place second only to Tara.</p>“Well, almost everything,” Frank amended hastily, disturbed by the expressions on their faces. He tried to look cheerful, for he did not believe in upsetting ladies. Upset ladies always upset him and made him feel helpless. He could not bring himself to tell them the worst. Let them find out from some one else.
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，不见得都烧光了吧？"姑娘们沮丧地说。<p>很难想像她们所熟悉的那个扰扰攘攘的城市，那个人口众多，驻满了军队的城市，就这样完了。那些荫蔽在大树底下的可爱的住宅，所有那些宏大的店铺和豪华的旅馆--决不会全都化为乌有的！媚兰好像要哭出声来了，因为她是出生在那里，从来不知道还有别的家乡。思嘉的心情也很沉重，因为除了塔拉，那是她最爱的一个地方。</p>“唔，差不多全烧光了，"弗兰克显然对她们脸上的表情感到有点为难，才连忙纠正说。他想要显得愉快一些，因为他不主张叫小姐太太们烦恼。女人一烦恼，他自己也就烦恼起来，不知怎么办好。他不能只顾讲那些最惨的事。让她们向另一个人去打听好了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He could not tell them what the army saw when it marched back into Atlanta, the acres and acres of chimneys standing blackly above ashes, piles of half-burned rubbish and tumbled heaps of brick clogging the streets, old trees dying from fire, their charred limbs tumbling to the ground in the cold wind. He remembered how the sight had turned him sick, remembered the bitter curses of the Confederates when they saw the remains of the town. He hoped the ladies would never hear of the horrors of the looted cemetery, for they’d never get over that. Charlie Hamilton and Melanie’s mother and father were buried there. The sight of that cemetery still gave Frank nightmares. Hoping to find jewelry buried with the dead, the Yankee soldiers had broken open vaults, dug up graves. They had robbed the bodies, stripped from the coffins gold and silver name plates, silver trimmings and silver handles. The skeletons and corpses, flung helter-skelter among their splintered caskets, lay exposed and so pitiful.</div>
  <div class="right">他不能告诉她们军队开回亚特兰大，进城时所看见的情景，如，那许许多多耸立在废墟上的烧黑的烟囱，那一堆堆没有烧完的垃圾和堆积在街道的残砖碎瓦，那些已经被烧死但焦黑的枝柯还迎着寒风撑持在地上的古树，等等。他还记得曾如何使他难受的那一片凄凉的光景，面对城市遗迹时联盟军弟兄们曾怎样深恶痛绝地诅咒。他希望妇女们永远也不会听说北军挖掘墓地的惨状，因为那将会使她们一辈子也摆脱不掉。查尔斯.汉密尔顿和媚兰的父母都埋在那里。墓地上的情景至今还常常给弗兰克带来恶梦呢。北方佬士兵希望拿到给死者殉葬的珠宝，便挖掘墓穴，劈开棺木。他们抢劫尸体上的东西，撬掉棺材上的金银名牌，也不放过上面的银饰品的银把手。尸体和骨凌乱地抛散在劈碎的棺木中间，暴露在风吹日晒之下，景象极为凄惨。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">And Frank couldn’t tell them about the dogs and the cats. Ladies set such a store by pets. But the thousands of starving animals, left homeless when their masters had been so rudely evacuated, had shocked him almost as much as the cemetery, for Frank loved cats and dogs. The animals had been frightened, cold, ravenous, wild as forest creatures, the strong attacking the weak, the weak waiting for the weaker to die so they could eat them. And, above the ruined town, the buzzards splotched the wintry sky with graceful, sinister bodies.
<p>Frank cast about in his mind for some mitigating information that would make the ladies feel better.</p>“There’s some houses still standing,” he said, “houses that set on big lots away from other houses and didn’t catch fire. And the churches and the Masonic hall are left And a few stores too. But the business section and all along the railroad tracks and at Five Points—well, ladies, that part of town is flat on the ground.”
</div>
  <div class="right">弗兰克也不能告诉她们城里猫狗的遭遇。小姐太太们是很爱喂养小动物的。可是成千上万挨饿的动物由于主人被强行撤走而变得无家可归四处流浪了，它们的悲惨境遇也像墓地上那样，使珍爱猫狗的弗兰克大为痛苦。那些受惊的动物忍冻挨饿，变得像林子里的牲畜一样粗野了。它们弱肉强食，彼此等待着对方成为牺牲品供自己饱餐一顿。同时那片废墟上头的凛冽天空中，有不少兀鹰嘴里叼着动物的腐尸残骸在盘旋飞舞。<p>弗兰克搜索枯肠，想找些缓和的话题，让小姐们感到好过些。</p>“那里有些房子还没有毁掉，"他说，"如离其他建筑物很远没有着上火的那些房子。教堂和共济会会堂也还在，还有少数的店铺。可是商业区和五点镇铁路两旁的建筑物--是的，女士们，城市的那个部分全都夷为平地了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Then,” cried Scarlett-bitterly, “that warehouse Charlie left me, down on the tracks, it’s gone too?”
<p>“If it was near the tracks, it’s gone, but—” Suddenly he smiled. Why hadn’t he thought of it before? “Cheer up, ladies! Your Aunt Pitty’s house is still standing. It’s kind of damaged but there it is.”</p>“Oh, how did it escape?”
<p>“Well, it’s made of brick and it’s got about the only slate roof in Atlanta and that kept the sparks from setting it afire, I guess. And then it’s about the last house on the north end of town and the fire wasn’t so bad over that way. Of course, the Yankees quartered there tore it up aplenty. They even burned the baseboard and the mahogany stair rail for firewood, but shucks! It’s in good shape. When I saw Miss Pitty last week in Macon—”</p>“You saw her? How is she?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“那么，"思嘉痛苦地喊道：“铁路那头查理留给我的那个仓库也一起完了吗？”<p>“要是靠近铁路，那就没有了，不过--"他突然微微一笑，他怎么事先没有想到这一点呢？"你们应当高兴起来，女士们！你们皮蒂姑妈的房子还在呢。它尽管损坏了一些，但毕竟还在嘛。"</p>“啊，它是怎么幸免的呀？"<p>“我想是这样，那房子是砖造的，还有亚特兰大唯一的一个石板屋顶，因此尽管落上了一些火星也没有烧起来，加上它又是城市最北端的一幢房子，而那一带的火势并不怎么猛，这不就幸免了？当然，也被驻扎在那里的北方佬军队毁坏了不少。他们甚至把护墙板和楼梯上的红木栏杆也拆下来当柴烧了，不过这都算不了什么！反正从外表那房子还是完好的。</p>上星期我在梅肯碰到皮蒂小姐时--”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Just fine. Just fine. When I told her her house was still standing, she made up her mind to come home right away. That is—if that old darky, Peter, will let her come. Lots of the Atlanta people have already come back, because they got nervous about Macon. Sherman didn’t take Macon but everybody is afraid Wilson’s raiders will get there soon and he’s worse than Sherman.”
<p>“But how silly of them to come back if there aren’t any houses! Where do they live?”</p></div>
  <div class="right">“你看见她了？她怎么样？”“不错，不错。我告诉她她的房子还在，她就决定立即回家去。那就是说--如果那个老黑人彼得让她回来。大批大批的亚特兰大市民都已经回来了，因为他们在梅肯实在待腻了。谢尔曼没有占领梅肯，可是人人都担心威尔逊的突击大队很快会打到那里，他比谢尔曼更坏。"<p>“不过，要是房子都没有了，他们还冒冒失失地跑回来，不是太傻了吗？"</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Miss Scarlett, they’re living in tents and shacks and log cabins and doubling up six and seven families in the few houses still standing. And they’re trying to rebuild. Now, Miss Scarlett, don’t say they are silly. You know Atlanta folks as well as I do. They are plumb set on that town, most as bad as Charlestonians are about Charleston, and it’ll take more than Yankees and a burning to keep them away. Atlanta folks are—begging your pardon, Miss Melly—as stubborn as mules about Atlanta. I don’t know why, for I always thought that town a mighty pushy, impudent sort of place. But then, I’m a countryman born and I don’t like any town. And let me tell you, the ones who are getting back first are the smart ones. The ones who come back last won’t find a stick or stone or brick of their houses, because everybody’s out salvaging things all over town to rebuild their houses. Just day before yesterday, I saw Mrs. Merriwether and Miss Maybelle and their old darky woman out collecting brick in a wheelbarrow. And Mrs. Meade told me she was thinking about building a log cabin when the doctor comes back to help her. She said she lived in a log cabin when she first came to Atlanta, when it was Marthasville, and it wouldn’t bother her none to do it again. ‘Course, she was only joking but that shows you how they feel about it.”</div>
  <div class="right">“思嘉小姐，他们都是住帐篷、小木屋和棚屋，有的六七家挤在一起。你跟我一样很了解亚特兰大人。他们是死心塌地要蹲在那个城市里，就像查尔斯顿人要蹲在查尔斯顿城那样，哪怕北方佬再来，再烧一次，也不能阻止他们回去。亚特兰大人嘛--媚兰小姐，恕我直言--都固执得像骡子。我不明白这是什么缘故，因为我常常感觉到那个城市是个很爱冲动和鲁莽冒失的地方。但是话又说回来，我这人本来就生长在乡下，不喜欢城市生活。而且我要告诉你们，那些最早回来的人都是些聪明能干的角色。而那些最晚才回来的呢，恐怕就连他们房基上的一根棍子、一块石头和一块砖都找不到了，因为人人都在全城到处找东西来重盖他们的房子。就在前天，我们看见梅里韦瑟太太和梅贝尔小姐，以及她们家的黑人老婆子，她们推着一辆独轮车在外面捡砖头。米德太太也告诉我，她正在考虑等大夫回来盖一所小木屋。她说她初次来亚特兰大时，这地方还叫马萨斯维尔，当时住的就是小木屋，那么现在再来也不会有什么困难的。当然，她只不过是开玩笑而已，不过这也说明了他们一般的想法。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I think they’ve got a lot of spirit,” said Melanie proudly. “Don’t you, Scarlett?”
<p>Scarlett nodded, a grim pleasure and pride in her adopted town filling her. As Frank said, it was a pushy, impudent place and that was why she liked it. It wasn’t hidebound and stick-in-the-muddish like the older towns and it had a brash exuberance that matched her own. “I’m like Atlanta,” she thought. “It takes more than Yankees or a burning to keep me down.”</p>“If Aunt Pitty is going back to Atlanta, we’d better go back and stay with her, Scarlett,” said Melanie, interrupting her train of thought. “She’ll die of fright alone.”
<p>“Now, how can I leave here, Melly?” Scarlett asked crossly. “If you are so anxious to go, go. I won’t stop you.”</p>“Oh, I didn’t mean it that way, darling,” cried Melanie, flushing with distress. “How thoughtless of me! Of course, you can’t leave Tara and—and I guess Uncle Peter and Cookie can take care of Auntie.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我看他们的精神都振作起来了，"媚兰骄傲地说。"思嘉，你难道不这样看吗？<p>“思嘉点点头，她心里也为这个作为第二故乡的城市暗暗地感到高兴和自豪。像弗兰克说的，那是个很爱冲动和鲁莽冒失的地方，可正因为这样她才喜欢它。它不像一些较老的城市那样顽固守旧，而是洋溢着一种跟她自己很一致的不惜冒险的精神。"我就像亚特兰大，"她心里暗想。"即使北方佬再来，再烧一次，也别想叫我们一蹶不振，从此站不起来了。"</p>"思嘉你看，如果皮蒂姑妈要回亚特兰大，我们最好了回去跟她住在一起，"媚兰打断思嘉的一连串设想，突然这样说。“否则，她一个人住在那里会吓死了。”<p>“可是，我怎么能离开这里呢？亲爱的，"思嘉有点不以为然地问。"如果你急于要去，就去好了。我不会阻拦你。"</p>“唔，亲爱的，我不是那个意思，"媚兰嚷道，脸色有点发急了。"瞧我多么粗心！当然你不能离开塔拉，而且--而且，我想，彼得大叔和厨娘也能照顾好姑妈的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“There’s nothing to keep you from going,” Scarlett pointed out, shortly.
<p>“You know I wouldn’t leave you,” answered Melanie. “And I—I would be just frightened to death without you.”</p>“Suit yourself. Besides, you wouldn’t catch me going back to Atlanta. Just as soon as they get a few houses up, Sherman will come back and burn it again.”
<p>“He won’t be back,” said Frank and, despite his efforts, his face drooped. “He’s gone on through the state to the coast. Savannah was captured this week and they say the Yankees are going on up into South Carolina.”</p>“Savannah taken!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“没有人会阻拦你，"思嘉率直地说。<p>“你知道我不愿意离开你嘛，"媚兰回答说。"何况我--我要是没有你，简直就会吓死了。"</p>“那就随你的便吧。而且，你也不用劝我回亚特兰大去。也许他们刚刚盖好几间房子，谢尔曼就回来又把它烧了。"<p>“他不会回来，”弗兰克说，尽管他努力控制，他的脸还是沉下来。"他已经穿过佐治亚州到海滨去了。这个星其他打下了萨凡纳，据说他们正在向南卡罗来纳开去。"</p>“萨凡纳被占领了？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes. Why, ladies, Savannah couldn’t help but fall. They didn’t have enough men to hold it, though they used every man they could get—every man who could drag one foot after another. Do you know that when the Yankees were marching on Milledgeville, they called out all the cadets from the military academies, no matter how young they were, and even opened the state penitentiary to get fresh troops? Yes, sir, they turned loose every convict who was willing to fight and promised him a pardon if he lived through the war. It kind of gave me the creeps to see those little cadets in the ranks with thieves and cutthroats.”
<p>“They turned loose the convicts on us!”</p>“Now, Miss Scarlett, don’t you get upset. They’re a long way off from here, and furthermore they’re making good soldiers. I guess being a thief don’t keep a man from being a good soldier, does it?”
<p>“I think it’s wonderful,” said Melanie softly.</p>“Well, I don’t,” said Scarlett flatly. “There’s thieves enough running around the country anyway, what with the Yankees and—” She caught herself in time but the men laughed.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的。怎么，女士们，萨凡纳是不能不丢的。他们没有足够的兵力守住它，只好利用可能得到的每一个人-—每一个还能拖着腿走路的人。你们可知道，北方佬向米列奇维尔进攻时，军事学校的学员不管多么年轻即被他们全调出来了，甚至还打开了州立监狱，从中得到新的兵力呢。是的，先生，他们释放了每一个愿意去打仗的犯人，并且应许他只要能熬过战争便将获得赦免。这叫我好像看见了那些幼小的军事学校学生跟盗贼和杀人犯站在同一支队伍里，真是恶心死了！“<p>“他们把罪犯都放出来害我们！"</p>“唔，你不用着急，思嘉小姐，他们离这里远着，而且他们会成为上好的士兵呢。我一个人做过贼也并不妨碍他当一个好兵嘛，是不是？"<p>“我觉得那太奇怪了，"媚兰轻轻地说。</p>“可是，我倒并不觉得奇怪，"思嘉坦然地说。"反正这个州里已经到处是盗贼横行了，又有北方佬，又有--"说到这里她赶紧打住了，可是那些军人已大笑起来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“What with Yankees and our commissary department,” they finished and she flushed.
<p>“But where’s General Hood’s army?” interposed Melanie hastily. “Surely he could have held Savannah.”</p>“Why, Miss Melanie,” Frank was startled and reproachful, “General Hood hasn’t been down in that section at all. He’s been fighting up in Tennessee, trying to draw the Yankees out of Georgia.”
<p>“And didn’t his little scheme work well!” cried Scarlett sarcastically. “He left the damn Yankees to go through us with nothing but schoolboys and convicts and Home Guards to protect us.”</p>“Daughter,” said Gerald rousing himself, “you are profane. Your mother will be grieved.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“又有北方佬，又有我们征购部，"他们补充说，这使她有点不好意思了。<p>“不过，胡德将军的部队在哪里呢？"媚兰急忙插进来。“要是他在萨内纳，一定会守得住的。”</p>“怎么，媚兰小姐，"弗兰克略带惊讶和责备的神情，"胡德将军一直在田纳西作战，根本就没有到那一带去过，想把北方佬从佐治亚拖出去。"<p>“他这个小算盘倒是打得不错嘛！”思嘉讽刺地喊道。"他不让该死的北方佬穿过我们这地方，可这儿只有学生娃娃和罪犯在保卫我们。"</p>“女儿，"杰拉尔德鼓起勇气说，"你这样说，你母亲会伤心的。太不应该了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“They are damn Yankees!” cried Scarlett passionately. “And I never expect to call them anything else.”
<p>At the mention of Ellen everyone felt queer and conversation suddenly ceased. Melanie again interposed.</p>“When you were in Macon did you see India and Honey Wilkes? Did they—had they heard anything of Ashley?”
<p>“Now, Miss Melly, you know if I’d had news of Ashley, I’d have ridden up here from Macon right away to tell you,” said Frank reproachfully. “No, they didn’t have any news but—now, don’t you fret about Ashley, Miss Melly. I know it’s been a long time since you heard from him, but you can’t expect to hear from a fellow when he’s in prison, can you? And things aren’t as bad in Yankee prisons as they are in ours. After all, the Yankees have plenty to eat and enough medicines and blankets. They aren’t like we are—not having enough to feed ourselves, much less our prisoners.”</p>“Oh, the Yankees have got plenty,” cried Melanie, passionately bitter. “But they don’t give things to the prisoners. You know they don’t, Mr. Kennedy. You are just saying that to make me feel better. You know that our boys freeze to death up there and starve too and die without doctors and medicine, simply because the Yankees hate us so much! Oh, if we could just wipe every Yankee off the face of the earth! Oh, I know that Ashley is—”
</div>
  <div class="right">"他们就是该死的北方佬！"思嘉激动地大声说。"我从来没想叫他们别的什么。"<p>提到爱伦，人人都感到诧异，谈话全突然中断了。这时媚兰又插进来。</p>“你们在梅肯时有没有见过威尔克斯家的英迪亚和霍妮？她们是不是--她们听到过关于艾希礼的消息没有？"<p>“唔，你知道，媚兰小姐，如果我们有艾希礼的消息，我们早就从梅肯赶过来告诉你了，"弗兰克略带责备地说。"不，她们没有什么消息，不过--你不用替艾希礼着急。媚兰小姐，我知道你已经很久没收到他的信了，可是你不能指望一个关在牢狱里的人给你写信嘛，你说对吗？而且北方佬牢狱里的情况并不像咱们的那样坏。毕竟北方佬那里能吃得饱，还有足够的药品和毯子。他们不像我们这样--我们连自己的肚子填不饱，俘虏就更不行了。"</p>“唔，北方佬的东西有不少，"媚兰非常痛苦地大声说，“可他们就是不给俘虏嘛。肯尼迪先生，你知道他们是不给的。你这样说，不过是想叫我好过些罢了。你知道我们的小伙子在那边冻得要死，饿得要命，而且不看医生不吃药就死了。这仅仅因为北方佬是那么恨我们呀。啊，要是我能够把北方佬从这地球上通通消灭掉，那才好呢！啊，我知道艾希礼已经--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Don’t say it!” cried Scarlett, her heart in her throat. As long as no one said Ashley was dead, there persisted in her heart a faint hope that he lived, but she felt that if she heard the words pronounced, in that moment he would die.
<p>“Now, Mrs. Wilkes, don’t you bother about your husband,” said the one-eyed man soothingly. “I was captured after first Manassas and exchanged later and when I was in prison, they fed me off the fat of the land, fried chicken and hot biscuits—”</p>“I think you are a liar,” said Melanie with a faint smile and the first sign of spirit Scarlett had ever seen her display with a man. “What do you think?”
<p>“I think so too,” said the one-eyed man and slapped his leg with a laugh.</p>“If you’ll all come into the parlor, I’ll sing you some Christmas carols,” said Melanie, glad to change the subject. “The piano was one thing the Yankees couldn’t carry away. Is it terribly out of tune, Suellen?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“不许这样说！"思嘉惊叫道，她的心都跳到喉咙里了。只要没有人说艾希礼已经死了，她心里就总怀有一丝希望，相信他仍然活着，可是她觉得要是她听到别人说出那个死字，艾希礼便会在这一瞬间死掉的。<p>“威尔克斯太太，听我说，你不必为你丈夫担心，"那个独眼大兵插进来安慰她。"我在头一次马纳萨斯战役后被北方佬俘虏过，后来才交换回来的。我在牢狱里时，他们尽给我吃那个地方的肥肉，还有烤鸡和热饼干--"</p>“我想你是在骗人吧，"媚兰略带笑容说，这时思嘉第一次看见她对一个男人表现出一点兴奋的神情。“你觉得怎么样？"<P>“我也这样想，"独眼龙拍着大腿笑了。</P>“要是你们都到客厅里来，我倒想给你们唱一支圣诞歌呢，"媚兰接着说，很高兴换个话题，"钢琴是北方佬没法带走的一样东西。苏伦？它是不是走调很厉害了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Dreadfully,” answered Suellen, happily beckoning with a smile to Frank.
<p>But as they all passed from the room, Frank hung back, tugging at Scarlett’s sleeve.</p>“May I speak to you alone?”
<p>For an awful moment she feared he was going to ask about her livestock and she braced herself for a good lie.</p>When the room was cleared and they stood by the fire, all the false cheerfulness which had colored Frank’s face in front of the others passed and she saw that he looked like an old man. His face was as dried and brown as the leaves that were blowing about the lawn of Tara and his ginger-colored whiskers were thin and scraggly and streaked with gray. He clawed at them absently and cleared his throat in an annoying way before he spoke.
</div>
  <div class="right">“厉害着呢，“苏伦答道，一面含笑招呼弗兰克。<p>但是当他们一起走出饭厅时，弗兰克故意落在后面，拉了拉思嘉的衣袖。</p>“我可以单独跟你谈谈吗？”<p>思嘉一时间十分惊慌，生怕他问起她的那些牲畜，于是她鼓起勇气，要找一个恰当的谎话。</p>别的人都走开了之后，他们两人站在炉边，这时弗兰克在众人跟前装出的快乐神色已经消失，思嘉发现他完全像个老头了。他的脸又干又黑，像塔拉草地上到处飘零的落叶，他那姜黄色的胡须稀疏散乱，有些已开始发白。他心不在焉地搔着胡须，又假咳了几声，这才用一种烦恼不堪的神色开始说话。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’m mighty sorry about your ma, Miss Scarlett.”
<p>“Please don’t talk about it.”</p>“And your pa— Has he been this way since—?”
<p>“Yes—he’s—he’s not himself, as you can see.”</p>“He sure set a store by her.”
<p>“Oh, Mr. Kennedy, please don’t let’s talk—”</p>“I’m sorry, Miss Scarlett,” and he shuffled his feet nervously. “The truth is I wanted to take up something with your pa and now I see it won’t do any good.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“思嘉小姐，我很为你母亲感到难过。”<p>“请不要谈这个吧。”</p>“还有你爸--他成了这个样子，是从--"<p>“是的，你看得出的，他是--他有点失常。"</p>“他自然很舍不得她嘛。"<p>“唔，肯尼迪先生，请不要谈起--”</p>“思嘉小姐，对不起，"他神经质地不断挪动他的双脚。“事实是我要跟你爸商量一件事，可如今发现那没有用了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Perhaps I can help you, Mr. Kennedy. You see—I’m the head of the house now.”
<p>“Well, I,” began Frank and again clawed nervously at his beard. “The truth is— Well, Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask him for Miss Suellen.”</p>“Do you mean to tell me,” cried Scarlett in amused amazement, “that you haven’t yet asked Pa for Suellen? And you’ve been courting her for years!”
<p>He flushed and grinned embarrassedly and in general looked like a shy and sheepish boy.</p>“Well, I—I didn’t know if she’d have me. I’m so much older than she is and—there were so many good-looking young bucks hanging around Tara—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“肯尼迪先生，也许我能帮忙。你看--我如今是这一家之主埃"<p>“那好，我，"弗兰克刚要开口又神经质地搔起胡须来。“事实是--嗯，思嘉小姐，我在打算向他求苏伦小姐呢。"</p>“你的意思是要告诉我，”思嘉又惊又喜地喊道，"你还没有向我爸提出要苏伦吗？可你追求她已经好几年了！"<p>弗兰克的脸红了，他像个羞涩而怯懦的孩子，难为情地咧嘴笑了笑。</p>“你看，我--我不知道她是否要我呢。我比她大这么多，而且--有那么多漂亮的年轻小伙子在塔拉农场周围转悠—-"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Hump!” thought Scarlett, “they were hanging around me, not her!”
<p>“And I don’t know yet if she’ll have me. I’ve never asked her but she must know how I feel. I—I thought I’d ask Mr. O’Hara’s permission and tell him the truth. Miss Scarlett, I haven’t got a cent now. I used to have a lot of money, if you’ll forgive me mentioning it, but right now all I own is my horse and the clothes I’ve got on. You see, when I enlisted I sold most of my land and I put all my money in Confederate bonds and you know what they’re worth now. Less than the paper they’re printed on. And anyway, I haven’t got them now, because they burned up when the Yankees burned my sister’s house. I know I’ve got gall asking for Miss Suellen now when I haven’t a cent but—well, it’s this way. I got to thinking that we don’t know how things are going to turn out about this war. It sure looks like the end of the world for me. There’s nothing we can be sure of and—and I thought it would be a heap of comfort to me and maybe to her if we were engaged. That would be something sure. I wouldn’t ask to marry her till I could take care of her, Miss Scarlett, and I don’t know when that will be. But if true love carries any weight with you, you can be certain Miss Suellen will be rich in that if nothing else.”</p>He spoke the last words with a simple dignity that touched Scarlett, even in her amusement. It was beyond her comprehension that anyone could love Suellen. Her sister seemed to her a monster of selfishness, of complaints and of what she could only describe as pure cussedness.
</div>
  <div class="right">“哼，"思嘉心想，"他们在围着我转呢，还轮得到她呀！"<p>“我不知道她会不会要我，我还从没问过她，不过她一定明白我的感情。我--我想我应当征得奥哈拉先生的同意，把实情告诉他。我现在手头一个钱也没有，思嘉小姐，我以前是很有钱的，如果你原谅我这样说的话，但现在我只剩下一骑马和身上穿的衣服了。你想，我入伍时便卖掉了家里的地，把所有的钱都买了联盟的债券，这债券你知道如今还值多少，它们连印刷的纸张费都不值了。何况我至今也没有拿到手，因为北方佬烧我姐姐的房子时连债券也烧掉了。我知道，我如今身无分文却向苏伦小姐求婚，这未免太冒昧了，可是--可事情就是如此，我也曾想过，我们还不知道这场战争打下去究竟会是什么样的结果。在我看来，它的确像是世界的末日。我们对任何事情都没有把握，因此--因此我想，如果我们订了婚，那对我和她都将是很大的安慰。这才是实实在在的安慰。我要等到能养活她的时候才跟她结婚，思嘉小姐，可我不知道这还要多久。不过，如果真诚的爱情还有点价值的话，你就可以相信，苏伦小姐即使没有任何别的东西也会是够富裕的了。"</p>他说最后几句话时，那态度是庄严的，这虽然使思嘉觉得有趣，却也深受感动。她很不理解怎么世界上会有人爱苏伦。在她看来，她这妹妹是个自私自利的怪物，她经常怨天尤人，同时还有一种怪毛病你简直难以言喻，只好说是地地道道的执拗症了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why, Mr. Kennedy,” she said kindly, “it’s quite all right. I’m sure I can speak for Pa. He always set a store by you and he always expected Suellen to marry you.”
<p>“Did he now?” cried Frank, happiness in his face.</p>“Indeed yes,” answered Scarlett, concealing a grin as she remembered how frequently Gerald had rudely bellowed across the supper table to Suellen: “How now, Missy! Hasn’t your ardent beau popped the question yet? Shall I be asking him his intentions?”
<p>“I shall ask her tonight,” he said, his face quivering, and he clutched her hand and shook it. “You’re so kind, Miss Scarlett.”</p>“I’ll send her to’ you,” smiled Scarlett, starting for the parlor. Melanie was beginning to play. The piano was sadly out of tune but some of the chords were musical and Melanie was raising her voice to lead the others in “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“肯尼迪先生，怎么，"她温和地说，"这很不错嘛。我相信我是能替爸说话的。他一直很看重你，他一直在期待着苏伦跟你结婚呢。"<p>“他真的这样？"弗兰克赶忙追问，他已经面有喜色了。</p>“当然是真的，"思嘉答道，同时忍住一声冷笑，因为她想起杰拉尔德时常隔着餐桌对苏伦大声吼叫：“怎么样，小姐！你那位火热的情郎还没有把问题提出来吗？要不要我问问他的意思呢？"<p>“今天晚上我就去问她，"肯尼迪说，这时他的脸皮在颤抖，他抓住思嘉的手使劲摇着：“思嘉小姐，你真好。"</p>“我会叫她来找你，"思嘉微笑说，朝客厅走去。媚兰正开始演奏。钢琴是严重走调了，但有的和弦听起来仍然很美。媚兰放开嗓子领着大家高唱《听啊，报信的天使们在歌唱》。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett paused. It did not seem possible that war had swept over them twice, that they were living in a ravaged country, close to the border of starvation, when this old sweet Christmas hymn was being sung. Abruptly she turned to Frank.
<p>“What did you mean when you said it looked like the end of the world to you?”</p></div>
  <div class="right">思嘉站住了。这看来是不可能，当两次遭到战争洗劫，他们正生活在一个破败的乡村濒于饥饿时，竟唱起这支古老而甜美的圣诞赞美诗来了。她突然朝弗兰克回过头来。<p>“你说你觉得这有点像世界的末日，那是什么意思呢？"</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’ll talk frankly,” he said slowly, “but I wouldn’t want you to be alarming the other ladies with what I say. The war can’t go on much longer. There arent any fresh men to fill the ranks and the desertions are running high—higher than the army likes to admit You see, the men can’t stand to be away from their families when they know they’re starving, so they go home to try to provide for them. I can’t blame them but it weakens the army. And the army can’t fight without food and there isn’t any food. I know because, you see, getting food is my business. I’ve been all up and down this section since we retook Atlanta and there isn’t enough to feed a jaybird. It’s the same way for three hundred miles south to Savannah. The folks are starving and the railroads are torn up and there aren’t any new rifles and the ammunition is giving out and there’s no leather at all for shoes. ... So, you see, the end is almost here.”</div>
  <div class="right">“我坦白说吧，"他慢吞吞地回答，"但我希望你不要拿我的话去吓唬别的太太小姐。战争已经持续不了多久了。已没有新的兵源去补充部队，而逃兵却愈来愈多--多到了军队不愿承认的地步。你看，他们怎能忍受这远离故乡的痛苦呢？当人们知道他们的家人在挨饿时，所以他们偷着跑回来设法帮助家庭。虽然我不能责怪他们，可是削弱了军队呀。而且军队不能饿着肚子打仗，可粮食却没有了。我了解这些，因为你知道我的任何就是征集军粮嘛。自从收复亚特兰大以来，我就一直在这整个地区跑来跑去，可弄到的食物还不够一只啊鸟吃的。这种情况在萨凡纳以南三百英里的地区也同样存在。军队都在挨饿，铁路又早已被截断，如今已根本没有新枪支，子弹也用完了，而且压根儿找不到皮革来做鞋……所有，你看，末日就差不多到了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But the fading hopes of the Confederacy weighed less heavily on Scarlett than his remark about the scarcity of food. It had been her intention to send Pork out with the horse and wagon, the gold pieces and the United States money to scour the countryside for provisions and material for clothes. But if what Frank said was true—
<p>But Macon hadn’t fallen. There must be food in Macon. Just as soon as the commissary department was safely on its way, she’d start Pork for Macon and take the chance of having the precious horse picked up by the army. She’d have to risk it.</p>“Well, let’s don’t talk about unpleasant things tonight, Mr. Kennedy,” she said. “You go and sit in Mother’s little office and I’ll send Suellen to you so you can—well, so you’ll have a little privacy.”
<p>Blushing, smiling, Frank slipped out of the room and Scarlett watched him go.</p>
“What a pity he can’t marry her now,” she thought. “That would be one less mouth to feed.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“不过，联盟的黯淡前途在思嘉心中并不怎么严重，更严重的倒是缺乏粮食。她一直在考虑要打发波克赶着马和车子，带着那些金币和联邦钞票，出去到乡下搜购粮食和做衣服的料子。但是，如果弗兰克说的这些话可靠--"<p>然而梅肯并没有伦陷。那儿一定会有粮食的。一旦等到征购队上了路，她就要派波克到梅肯去，即使那匹马有被军队掳去的可能，也要试一试。看来她必须冒这个险了。</p>“好吧，肯尼迪先生，我们今晚别谈那些不愉快的事了，"思嘉说，"你坐在我母亲的小办事房里去，我就叫苏伦去见你，这样你便可以--对，你们就好私下里谈谈了。"<p>弗兰红着脸，微笑着，思嘉看着他走了悄悄溜出饭厅。</p>“他眼下还不能娶她，这太可惜了，"她心中暗想。"否则就会省去一张吃饭的嘴呢。”</div></div>
