  <p>This is the only short story wrote by Jin Yong.   Because of its short length, you can't really see Jin Yong's full talent at   story-telling. However, this translation can give you some idea of what a   martial arts story is like. My clumsy translation can't really do the original   justice, but I hope I have stirred your interest enough that you will go out   there and find out more about Chinese culture, history and legend. The process   of finding out will not be easy, but I assure you, what you will find will never   be dull.
<h3>Background:</h3>
This story is based on real historical events that occurred   during the 5th century B.C. It 's a period between what's known as the Spring   and Autumn period and the Warring Kingdoms period. China was yet to be united   under the First Emperor. The so-called Han race didn't exist yet. China was   divided into big and small kingdoms, dukedoms and counties which warred with   each other constantly.
<p>It all started when the king of Chuh slept with his son's fiancee. Bad move,   for any era. The king now feared that his son will turn against him. The fear   was fanned into action by the allegations of an ambitious minister who wanted to   destroy the crown prince's faction. The resulting purge destroyed many clans and   families. One of the family, almost peripheral to the whole thing, was the House   of Wu. The youngest son, Wu Tzu-Shi, escaped and vowed bloody vengeance. </p>
<p>After a long and dangerous journey through several kingdoms unwilling to   help, he arrived at the newly founded kingdom of Wu (No, the Chinese characters   for the Wu in Wu Tzu-Shi is actually different from the character Wu in the Wu   kingdom). He helped Prince Ho Lu to assassinate his cousin the king in a   convoluted power struggle. Then he built up the kingdom of Wu from a barely   civilized kingdom to a modern kingdom with the best trained army in the known   world. Sun Tzu, who wrote the immortal Art of War, served in Wu at this time. </p>
<p>When Wu Tzu-Shi was ready, he managed to convince King Ho Lu to invade Chuh.   At the time Chuh was a superpower and Wu was an upstart kingdom, but the upstart   kingdom managed to destroy Chuh's army utterly. Unfortunately, Wu Tzu-shi's   vengeance was hollow. The object of his vengeance had already died several years   ago. In his rage, Wu Tzu-Shi exhumed the body of the dead king and flogged it   until it fell to pieces. </p>
<p>The kingdom of Wu proved itself incapable of absorbing the far larger kingdom   of Chuh, so Wu Tzu-Shi had to take his army back to Wu. Then, Ho Lu began a   series of wars to establish hegemony over the rest of China. It's in one of   those wars when he ran into the kingdom of Yueh. The Yueh people was then even   more primitive then Wu was a few decades ago, but they were great fighters. They   were ruled by King Kou Chiang. In a pitch battle, King Ho Lu was struck by a   poison arrow and died. </p>
<p>Ho Lu's son Fu Chai became king. He was intent on avenging his father. A   personal guard was ordered to remind him of this fact periodically by saying &quot;Fu   Chai, did you forget to avenge the death of your father?&quot; Fu Chai then rallied   his army and destroyed the army of Yueh. King Kou Chiang became a prisoner of Fu   Chai for several years. However, Fu Chai was not a brutal man. Instead of   annexing the kingdom of Yueh and turning Kou Chiang into a slave, he released   Kou Chiang after extracting an oath of fealty from the king of Yueh.   Unfortunately, that gesture of mercy was completely lost on King Kou Chiang. Kou   Chiang, like Wu Tzu-Shi and Fu Chai before him, was possessed by the burning   desire to avenge the wrongs done him. </p>
<p>Kou Chiang hired two wise men from the kingdom of Chuh. One of them was Feng   Li, the other was Wen Chung. The two began to build up the barbaric kingdom of   Yueh so one day their king could challenge the power of Wu. Many legends are   associated with this period of history. One of the legends was the legend of the   Yueh Maiden. </p>

&quot;After you.&quot;
<p>&quot;After you.&quot; </p>
<p>The two swordmen turned the point of their blades downward. Their right palm   holding the sword hilt, their left palm covered their right palm, then they   bowed deeply to each other in a warrior's salute. </p>
<p>Even before the two straightened, a sudden flash of white, then the sound of   clanging. The two swordmen each retreated one step. The audience gave out a soft   cry . </p>
<p>The swordman in blue cut three times. The liveried swordman blocked each   cut. The swordman in blue shouted and slashed his sword from the upper left   corner straight downward. The slash was powerful and fast. The liveried swordman   was too agile to be caught. A simple jump got him out of the way. His body   bounced barely after his left feet touched the ground. He returned two slashes.   The swordman in blue stood still with a grim smile. He moved his sword lightly   and blocked the attack. </p>
<p>The liveried swordman suddenly began running around the swordman in blue. He   ran faster and faster. The swordman in blue merely stared at the point of his   enemy's sword. He was ready to strike anytime that point moved to attack. The   liveried swordman at first ran one way, then the other. The swordman in blue   started to feel a bit dizzy and said &quot;Are you fighting, or running for your   life?&quot; The liveried swordman continued running. The swordman in blue attempted   to cut him down a few times, but his sword always fell short. </p>
<p>The swordman in blue pulled his sword back to the side of his body and bowed   his right leg slightly. The liveried swordman thought he saw an opening and   lounged at his left shoulder, the swordman in blue was merely luring his enemy.   His sword circled into a direct thrust at the liveried swordman's throat. The   thrust was too fast to be avoided. The liveried swordman was surprised. He threw   his sword toward the heart of his enemy. The liveried swordman hoped to force   the swordman to abort the thrust in order to save his own life. </p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the swordman in blue didn't attempt to defend himself. With a   move of his arm, the point of his sword entered the liveried swordman's throat.   Then the liveried swordman's thrown sword hit his chest with a loud clang and   fell to the ground. The swordman in blue laughed coldly and pulled his sword   back. He was wearing a round plate of iron in front of his chest, just under the   garment. That's why the sword did him no harm. The liveried swordman's throat   spurted blood and his body convulsed. The servants stepped in to remove the body   and began to wipe up the blood on the ground. </p>
<p>The swordman in blue sheathed his sword. He stepped forward and bowed toward   the north of the hall where the king sat. The king wore a purple robe. He is of   strange appearance. His neck was excessive long and his mouth was sharp as a   bird's beak. He smiled and said in a croaking voice &quot;The strong one has   wonderful sword skill. Award him ten pounds of gold.&quot; The swordman in blue knelt   down on his right knee and bowed &quot;Thank you for the award.&quot; The king waved his   left hand. An official on his right shouted &quot;Swordmen of Wu and swordmen of   Yueh,second contest!&quot; </p>
<p>From the east end of the hall, another liveried swordman walked out from his   group. This man was tall of stature and held a great sword. The sword was nearly   four feet in length. The blade was extremely thick and was obviously quite   heavy. From the west of hall, another swordman in blue walked out. He was of   medium height. His face was crisscrossed by at least twelve or thirteen sword   scars. The face seemed no longer human. He must have fought hundreds of battles   with countless swordmen. The two knelt to the king, then they saluted each   other. </p>
<p>The swordman in blue straightened his body and smiled. His face made the   smile seemed ugly and cruel. The tall swordman shivered. Then he sighed deeply   and held his sword with both hands. </p>
<p>Suddenly the swordman in blue howled madly like a wolf and thrusted his   sword. The tall swordman cried, lifted his great sword and cut down toward his   opponent's head. The swordman in blue dodged while his sword made a slash from   left to right. The tall swordman lifted the great sword and whirled, making the   sounds of a great wind. The great weight of the sword didn't slow him down in   the slightest. </p>
<p>The two made thirty passes at each other. The swordman in blue couldn't   oppose the weight of his opponent's sword. He kept retreating. All the other   liveried swordman began to show hope on their faces as they anticipated their   side to win at last. </p>
<p>Then the tall swordman made a great cry like the sound of a thunderclap and   made a horizontal cut with his great sword. The swordman in blue couldn't avoid   it. He could only block it with his own sword with all his strength. Clang! The   two swords met. The great sword broke and half of the blade flew away. The   swordman in blue wielded a far sharper sword. Then the swordman in blue made a   vertical cut which opened up the tall swordman from throat to crotch. The tall   swordman howled and kept on howling as he felt to the ground. The swordman in   blue looked at his fallen opponent for a while before returning his sword to the   sheath. Then he knelt toward the king. His face couldn't disguise his joy of   victory. </p>
<p>The official said &quot;The strong one's sword skill is impressive. The award is   ten pounds of gold.&quot; The swordman in blue bowed in thanks. There were only eight   swordmen in blue. Compared with fifty liveried swordmen standing at the east   side of the hall, they were badly outnumbered. </p>
<p>The official said &quot;Swordmen of Wu and swordmen of Yueh, the third contest.&quot; </p>
<p>Again, one swordman from each walked to the center of the hall. The sword of   the swordman in blue trembled and shone like bright silk. The official said   &quot;Good sword!&quot; The swordman in blue thanked his praise. The official then said   &quot;We have seen one-to-one contests twice. This time, two against two!&quot; </p>
<p>Two more swordmen entered the arena. The four again saluted the king first   before saluting each other. Then the swords flashed as the combat began. This   time, each of the two swordmen on the same side must reinforce each other. After   a few passes, a liveried swordmen's sword was cut into half by his enemy's   sword. This liveried swordman was very courageous. He carried his broken and   jumped toward his enemy. His opponent's sword flashed and cut away his right arm   together with his right shoulder. Then the sword impaled his heart. </p>
<p>The other pair was still fighting. The victorious swordman in blue watched   for a while, then his sword moved. Again, the liveried swordman's sword was cut   into half, leaving him wide open. His oponent's sword entered his chest and   exited from his back </p>
<p>. The king laughed and clapped &quot;Excellent swords! Excellent sword skills.   Award them wine and gold. Let us see one contest of four against four!&quot; </p>
<p>Four swordmen from each side began combat. The swordmen from the east side   had already lost three contests. These four fought desperately with all their   skills. Even if they lost their lives, they meant to win at least one contest.   Two swordmen in blue concentrated on one liveried swordman. The other two   swordmen in blue defended them against the other three liveried swordmen. These   swordmen in blue only defended. Their skill of defense was impenetrable. They   also made no attempt to attack, all they did was preventing the three from   aiding their comrade. The other two swordman in blue easily killed their lone   opponent. Then they repeated their tactic again and killed another liveried   swordman. </p>
<p>The other liveried swordmen saw the death of their comrades. They drew their   swords and was ready to aid their comrades and chopped the swordmen in blue to   bits. </p>
<p>The official cried out in a clear voice &quot;Those who learned the way of the   sword, must obey the laws of the swor !&quot; </p>
<p>His voice was authoritative. The liveried swordmen quieted down. By now   everyone could see that the swordmen in blue used completely different sword   skills. The two who defended were specialized in defense. The two who attacked   specialized in attack. The attackers always outnumber their victim because the   defenders watched their back. They could win even if their opponents numbered   six or even eight. The swords of the two defenders formed a sword net which   could handle five or even six swordmen easily. </p>
<p>The two defenders had cornered a liveried swordman so he was virtually   neutralized while the two attackers already killed the third liveried swordman.   The two defenders moved left and right and watched for more enemies while the   two attackers began on the lone swordman. Even though the liveried swordman had   no hope of winning, still he didn't throw down his sword to admit defeat.   Suddenly the four swordmen in blue shouted loudly and their four swords impaled   the liveried swordman from four directions. </p>
<p>The liveried swordman died immediately, but his eyes were opened like round   saucers. His mouth opened widely. The four swordmen in blue pulled out their   swords at the same time. The four wiped their swords at the sole of their shoes,   then they returned their swords back into the sheath. The movements were   completely synchronized. </p>
<p>The king laughed and clapped his hands together again &quot;Excellent sword skill!   The swordmen of the great kingdom were truly invincible. It's only today that   we're treated to such a spectacle. Award each swordman ten pounds of gold.&quot; The   four bowed in thanks. They bowed at the same exact angle. No one knew how long   they practiced to achieve such precision. </p>
<p>A swordman in boue turned, picked a long box covered in gold paint and said   &quot;Our king thank the generous gifts of Your Majesty. His Majesty ordered us to   return the favor with one precious sword. This sword is newly forged in our   kingdom for the enjoyment of Your Majesty.&quot; </p>
<p>The king smiled &quot;Thank you. Minister Feng, bring it over here.&quot; </p>
<p>The king was Kou Chiang, King of Yueh. The official was Feng Li, the royal   advisor. The liveried swordmen were the Royal Guards of Yueh. The eight swordmen   in blue were the messengers sent by Fu Chai, King of Wu. Kou Chiang was defeated   by Fu Chai and he waited for a chance for vengeance. While he was submissive to   the Kingdom of Wu on the surface, he secretly trained soldiers in preparation   for an attack on Wu. In order to test the skill of Wu warriors, he sent out the   best of his swordmen. He could not expect that the Wu swordmen easily killed   eight of his finest swordmen. He was surprised and angry, but he showed none of   it. Instead, he praised the sword skills of the Wu swordmen and showed his   heartfelt admiration. </p>
<p>Feng Li took the golden long box. The box felt very light, as thought it's   empty. He opened up the cover. Before the other people in the hall could see   what's in the box, Feng Li's face was illuminated by a faint blue light.   Everyone cried in surprise. </p>
<p>Feng Li took the box to Kou Chiang and bowed &quot;Please look, Your Majesty.&quot; Kou   Chiang saw that the box was lined with red silk. The sword inside it had a very   thin blade. The light it reflected flowed on its surface like water. He said   &quot;Excellent sword!&quot; He took the hilt and lifted up the sword. The blade trembled   slightly, almost as though he could break the blade with a flick of his wrist.   He thought &quot;The sword blade is too thin. It might look good, but it has no   practical use.&quot; </p>
<p>The leader of the swordmen in blue took out a piece of gauze from his pocket   and threw it into the air. &quot;Please, Your Majesty, point the edge of the sword   upward so it will meet this falling gauze. You will see that this sword is   different.&quot; The thin gauze fell upon the edge of the sword, but the gauze didn't   stop falling. It kept falling, as two separate gauzes. The people on the hall   cheered. </p>
<p>The swordman in blue said &quot;This blade might be thin, but it will not break   even if it blocks a heavy weapon.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Minister Feng, try it.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng said &quot;Yes.&quot; He walked in front of a liveried swordman, took out the   sword and said &quot;Draw, let's try it.&quot; The liveried swordman bowed, drew his   sword, but he didn't dare to strike. Feng Li cried &quot;Strike!&quot; The swordman cut   downward. Feng met it with his sword. The two swords met. The sword blade of the   liveried swordmen was cut into two pieces. Before one of the pieces flew into   him, Feng Li dodged wit great agility. The people inside the hall cheered. Were   they cheering the sharpness of the blade, or the agility of Feng? </p>
<p>Feng Li put the sword back into the box and put the box next to the feet of   the king. Kou Chiang said &quot;Swordmen of the great kingdom, you are invited to the   next hall for a feast and be awarded for the contest.&quot; The eight swordmen in   blue bowed and left the hall. Kou Chiang waved his hand, all the swordmen,   servants and ministers left, except for Feng Li. </p>
<p>Kou looked at the sword and the blood on the ground and said &quot;What you do   think?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Not all the Wu soldiers are as good as these eight. Not all   swords wielded by them are as sharp as this one. But from this small example, we   can see the rest. The most terrifying aspect is their technique of group   fighting, they used the methods of Sun Tzu. I believe that they currently have   no match in the world.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Fu Chai sent these eight just to give me this sword. What   does he have in mind?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;He wants us to know the difficulty of vengeance.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang became angry. He took up the sword and made a backhand stroke. The   stroke cut up the half of the back of his chair. He shouted &quot;Even if the   difficulty is one thousand, ten thousand times greater, Kou Chiang will not   retreat from his goal! One day, I will capture Fu Chai, king of Wu and cut off   his heead with his sword.&quot; Another stroke of the sword cut the chair into half. </p>
<p>Feng Li bowed and said &quot;Congratualations, Your Majesty.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou said in surprise &quot;After seeing the ability of the Wu swordmen, what's   there to congratulate about?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;As long as You Majesty have the determination, anything can be   accomplished. Concerning this difficulty, I must discuss it with Minister Wen.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Good, summon Minister Wen.&quot; Feng Li left the palace and   ordered the palace servant to summon Minister Wen Chung. In a while, Wen Chung   arrived on a speedy horse, then the two walked back into the palace </p>
<p>. Feng Li was originally a native of Wan, in the Kingdom of Chuh. He was not   a man concerned with the details of etiquette. Often, he did things beyond the   expectations of other people. People of his homeland called him &quot;Feng the   Crazy&quot;. When Wen Chung came to be the magistrate of Wan, he heard of the Feng   Li's reputation. He sent subordinates to summon Feng. The subordinates said   &quot;That Feng is the famous crazy man of this land. Nothing he does makes any   sense.&quot; Wen Chung smiled &quot;When a man try to do something different, other people   always say that he is mad. When he has a superior opinion, the common of wit   will call him stupid. How can you understand Master Feng?&quot; So Wen Chung went to   visit Feng himself, but Feng avoided him. Feng expected that Wen would not give   up so easily, so he borrowed some proper clothes from his brother. When Wen came   back, Feng was ready. The two talked and found that they had much in common. </p>
<p>They both felt the kingdoms were weak. The kingdom of Chuh was large, but   chaotic. The only kingdoms which could rise to command the rest were located at   southeast. Wen Chung resigned his position and went to the kingdom of Wu with   Feng Li. At the time. the king of Wu's favorite was Wu Tzu-Shi. The two lived in   the capital for a few month and saw that Wu Tzu-Shi was indeed a wise man. They   were not necessarily better than him. </p>
<p>After some discussion, they decided that although Yueh was a smaller kingdom,   but they could put their talents to use there. Kou Chiang received them warmly   and gave them both high positions. </p>
<p>Then Kou Chiang ignored the advise of Wen Chung and made war with Wu. His   army was defeated by the shore of Chiang Tang River. Kou Chiang was surrounded   at Kuai Chi Mountain and almost died along with his kingdom, but he listened to   the advise of Feng Li and Wen Chung and bribed the Prime Minister of Wu. Fu Chai   then listened to the Prime Minister instead of the wiser Wu Tzu-Shi and agreed   to a peace treaty. Kou Chiang lived in Wu as a hostage for a few years, but he   was released later. Then Kou Chiang slept only on beds made of thorny branches   and tasted the bitter juice of beef gall bladders to remind himself of the   humiliations he suffered. He used Wen Chung's Nine Methods to subvert Wu and   strengthen Yueh. </p>
<p>The Nine Methods were. One, pay respect to the gods and spirits. Two, give Fu   Chai vast amount of money so he will feel secure as well as becoming soft in   luxury. Three, borrow food from Wu and return seeds which will not grow, causing   famine in Wu. Four, give Fu Chai beautiful women such as Si Shi and Cheng Dang,   so Fu Chai would be paying more attention to the beautiful women rather than the   affairs of the state. Five, give Fu Chai engineers so he started building   expensive palaces which drained the economy of the country. Six, bribe the   ministers of Wu. Seven, distance Fu Chai from his wise ministers. The wise Wu   Tzu-Shi was eventually forced to committ suicide as punishment of a false charge   of treason. Eight, hoard food so the kingdom of Yueh will have great reserve   available. Nine, make weapons, train soldier and wait for the chance. Eight   methods have succeeded, but the ninth had run into great difficulty. </p>
<p>Everyone could tell that the eight warriors of Wu were better than anyone   Yueh could produce. Feng Li told Wen Chung the results of the contest. Wen Chung   frowned &quot;Brother Feng, the sharpness of their swords is a major problem, also   the way their swordmen worked together in groups in accordance to Sun Tzu's Art   of War.&quot; Feng Li said &quot;Yes, decades ago, when Sun Tzu helped the king of Wu.   They destroyed Chuh, the most powerful kingdom in the world at the time. In his   book, it's said &quot;If I concentrate my forces and the enemy's forces is fragmented   into ten parts then I can use my unified one to attack his ten fragments. Then I   will outnumber my enemy and the battle will be over.&quot; Wu used this principle to   achieve local superiority against our swordmen.&quot; </p>
<p>When they talk they arrived in front of Kou Chiang. Kou Chiang was staring at   the gift sword. After a long while, Kou Chiang lifted up his head and said   &quot;Minister Wen. Years ago, Wu had the husband-wife team of swordsmiths, Keng   Chiang and Mo Shei. Yueh had O-Yeh Tzu. Now, all three have died. Wu still have   great swordsmiths, yet we have no one to succeed O-Yeh Tzu.&quot; </p>
<p>Wen Chung said &quot;I have heard that O-Yeh Tzu had two students. One is named   Fong Hu-Tzu, The other is called Hsieh Chu. Fong Hu-Tzu is in the kingdom of   Chuh. Hsieh is still in Yueh.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou became glad and said &quot;Summon him. And order someone to go to Chuh with   gold so we can get Fong Hu-Tzu here as well.&quot; </p>
<p>The next morning, Wen Chung reported that he already sent someone to Chuh.   Meanwhile, Hsieh Chu was already here. Kou Chiang grant Hsieh an audience and   asked &quot;Your master O-Yeh Tzu once followed my father's ordder and forged five   swords. How do you grade those five swords?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;I have heard my master said that he forged five swords for the   king. Three large swords and two small swords. They are Trembling Reed, Pure   Edge, Defeater of Evil, Fish Intestine and the Great Tower. Now, the Trembling   Reed is in Chuh. Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine are in Wu. Your Majesty   still have Pure Edge and Great Tower.&quot; </p>
<p>Years ago, the Prince Ho Lu of Wu heard of the swords and asked Kou Chiang's   father for some of the swords. Kou Chiang's father feared the might of Wu and   gave Holu Trembling Reed, Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine. Using Fish   Intestine, Ho Lu assassinated his cousin the king and took the throne. Trembling   Reed fell into a river and was acquired by the king of Chuh. King of Chin heard   of this and asked for it. Even after a few wars, the king of Chuh still refused   to give it up. </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;My master said, of the five swords, Defeater of Evil is of the   highest grade. Pure Edge and Trembling Reed are next. Fish Intestine is lower   and Great Tower ranks last. When Great Tower was forged, the alloy was not pure,   so it was only a sharp sword and not a truly precious sword.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Are you saying my Pure Edge and Great Tower are not as good   as Fu Chai's Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh dare not admit that Kou Chiang's swords was inferior, but Kou Chiang   knew the answer anyway. </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;You have the skill of your master. You can forge a few swords   of your own. They might not be inferior to those owned by Wu.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;I cannot forge swords anymore.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li asked &quot;Why?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh held up his hands. On both his hands, the thumb and the index fingers   were gone. He said sadly &quot;Thumbs and index fingers are required for forging   swords. I am a cripple.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Did you enemy cut away your fingers?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;No, my fellow student did it.&quot; &quot;Your fellow student? You mean   Fong Hu-Tzu? Why did he doe it? Ah! It must be that you have greater skill than   he. He beame jealous and cut away your fingers.&quot; Hsieh remained silent. </p>
<p>Ko Chiang said &quot;I was thinking about inviting Fong from Chuh, but now I see   he won't come because he fears your vengeance.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Your Majesty is indeed wise, but Fong is no longer in Chuh. He is   in Wu. </p>
<p>Ko Chiang said &quot;He...He's in Wu? What's he doing there?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Three years ago, Fong came to my home and took out a precious   sword for me to inspect. I was astounded. That sword was forged by my master for   Chuh. It is named the Flowing Fabric. The blade was full of runes that flowed   like water. I heard from my master that he forged three swords for Chuh. That   was one, the others were Dragon Spring and Ching Ah.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Then the king of Chuh must have given it to Fong.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Indirectly. Fong said that after the army of Wu broke the capital   of Chuh. Wu Tzu-shi took the sword from the grave of the previous king. When he   returned to Wu, he heard of the skills of Fong, so he gave the sword to him as a   gift. He said the sword was a legacy from our master and that Fong was the   rightful owner.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;Wu Tzu-Shi let the sword go? He is truly a great hero to let   such a treasure go.&quot; Then he laughed &quot;Fortunately, Fu Chai has already taken   care of him for me.&quot; Then he asked &quot;What did Wu Tzu-Shi wanted in return from   Fong?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Wu Tzu-shi merely said that he admired our master. Fong felt   grateful after he received the sword, so he went to Wu and thanked Wu Tzu-Shi in   person. Wu Tzu-Shi treated as an honored guest.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;That's how he make people become loyal to him, even onto   death.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Your Majesty is wise, but Fong didn't understand Wu Tzu-shi's   true intentions, so he asked again and again how he could repay the great favor   done to him. Wu Tzu -Shi merely said he would not ask anything of an honored   guest.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;The old fox!&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Fong finally said to Wu Tzu-shi that he had little skill except   forging swords. In return for Wu Tzu-Shi's favors, he will forge a few precious   swords for him.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou slapped his thigh and said &quot;Got him!&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;But Wu Tzu-shi said the kingdome of Wu already had many precious   swords and needed no more. Besides, the forging of a precious sword is a   tremendous labor. Years ago, when Keng Chiang and Mo Yeh were forging their   sword, the sword refused to come into being until Mo Yeh flung herself into the   fire. Wu Tzu-shi had no intention of repeating that kind of tragedy.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;He didn't want Fong to forge swords for him? Strange.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Fong was baffled too. Then Wu Tzu-shi visited him again. They   said that the army of Wu was fully capable of fighting with superpowers like the   kingdoms of Chi and Jin. Wu's warriors were courageous, but their skills in   chariot warfare were inferior. Moreover, their swords and spears were not sharp   enough. Fong began to talk to Wu Tzu-Shi about the way of forging swords. What   Wu Tzu-Shi wanted wasn't a few precious swords with mysterius powers, what he   wanted was thousands and thousands of sharp swords.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang understood and looked at Feng Li and Wen Chung. Worry filled Wen   Chung's face. He asked &quot;Minister Feng, what do you think?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Even though Wu Tzu-shi is crafty, he is not wise enough to   escape Your Majesty's schemes.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang laughed &quot;I am afraid that I have never been Wu Tzu-shi's match.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Wu Tzu-shi is already dead. What more can he do to threaten   Yueh?&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang laughed &quot;True. Hsieh Chu. Did Fong finally started forging   swords?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Yes. He went to Mt. Mo Keng. He saw one thousand swordsmiths   working there. He corrected and improved their techniques. After this, every   sword in Wu is sharper than anything made in other kingdoms.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang nodded &quot;So that's why.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;After one year, Fong became too fatigued to continue, so he told   Wu Tzu-shi my name. Wu Tzu-shi readied lavish gifts and asked Fong to invite me   to work for him as well. I remembered the hatred between Wu and Yueh. If Wu's   sharp swords could kill the people of Chi and Jin, they could also kill the   people of my home, so I counseled Fong not to return to Wu.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou nodded in approval &quot;You have foresight.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Thank for your praise, Your Majesty, but he didn't listen to me.   That night he slept in my home. In the middle of the night, suddenly he put his   sword at my neck, then he chopped off four of my fingers so I'll never forge   another sword.&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang became angry &quot;If he fell into my hands, I would chop him into meat   paste!&quot; </p>
<p>Wen Chung said &quot;Master Hsieh, even though you cannot forge swords by   yourself, but you can teach our swordsmiths. We, too, can make as many sharp   swords as the Wu swordsmiths.&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh said &quot;Minister Wen, both Yueh and Wu produce the necessary iron needed   for sword blades, but Yueh produces copper and Wu produces zinc.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Wu Tzu-Shi is guarding the zinc mines and forbids any private   mining, is that right?&quot; </p>
<p>Hsieh showed surprise on his face &quot;So you knew already.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li smiled &quot;No, I am merely speculating. Now that he's dead, his order   may not be followed anymore. We now can purchase zinc, if we're willing to pay   for it..&quot; </p>
<p>Kou Chiang said &quot;But a source of water far away cannot extinguish a nearby   conflagration. By the time we gather all the materials, train the swordsmiths   and start production, at least two or three years would have passed. That's not   counting any setbacks along the way. If Fu Chai died before we're ready,   wouldn't that be the greatest regret in our lives?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li and Wen Chung bowed deeply &quot;Yes, we will find another way.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li walked out of the palace, thinking &quot;His Majesty couldn't wait two or   three more years? Why, I can't even wait one more day....&quot; A dull pain came to   his chest as he remembered the image of that unmatched beauty which could stun   the world. </p>
<p>Her name was Si Shi. She lived next to Huan Sha River He found that woman who   gathered all the beauty of the land of Yueh into her person and he had to send   her away into the palace of Wu. </p>
<p>The road from the capital of Yueh to the capital of Wu was not long, only a   few days by river, but that was long enough for love to grow beyond control. The   white face of Si Shi was full of pearl-like tears and her voice was soft as a   whispering stream &quot;Shao Bo, promise me that you will come and get me as soon as   possible. I will wait for you, day and night. Say that you will never forget me,   forever and ever.&quot; </p>
<p>Vengeance against Wu could wait, as far as Feng Li was concerned, but Yi   Kwan,that's his name for Si Shi, was in the embrace of King Fu Chai. Love and   jealousy gnawed at his heart. He must find to way to make as many sharp swords   as possible, even sharper than those wielded by the invincible Wu swordmen.... </p>
<p>He walked aimlessly on the street. Eighteen armed guards followed him   faithfully. </p>
<p>Suddenly someone was singing a Wu song &quot;My sword is sharp! My enemy has no   courage! My sword is sharp! My enemy has no head!&quot; </p>
<p>Eight men in blue, arm in arm, swaggered down the street, showing no concern   for the pedestrians who were hurrying out of their way. They were the eight Wu   swordmen. They were obviously very drunk. </p>
<p>Feng Li frowned. He could feel his anger rising. </p>
<p>The eight swordmen stopped in front of Feng Li. One of them looked sideways   with his drunken eyes and said &quot;You...you are Minister Feng?&quot; Then he broke into   uncontrollable giggles. Two guards leaped in front of Feng Li and said &quot;Don't be   so rude. Make way!&quot; </p>
<p>The eight swordmen merely laughed and mimicked their words &quot;Don't be so rude.   Make way!&quot; </p>
<p>Two guards pulled out their swords and cried &quot;By royal decree, those who dare   to interfere with Minister Feng's welfare is to be executed!&quot; </p>
<p>One of the Wu swordman's body swayed as he said &quot;Execute you, or me?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng's mind was working. &quot;They were the subjects of Wu. Even though they are   rude. We cannot affford to fight them.&quot; Before he could tell his guards to pull   back, a bright sword flashed. The guards screamed. Then their swords dropped to   the ground. One of the Wu swordman returned his sword into the sheath, his face   was full of gloating pride. The rest of Feng Li's guards pulled out their swords   and surrounded the eight Wu swordmen. </p>
<p>The leader raised his head and laughed &quot;We never planned to return to Wu   alive anyway. Let's see how big an army you need in order to kill us!&quot; With a   shout, eight swords leaped out of their sheaths. Eight swordmen stood back to   back, forming a circle. </p>
<p>Feng Li thought &quot;If one could not endure small slights, then one would never   achieve great things.&quot; He shouted &quot;These eight are ambassadors from the Great   Kingdom. Don't treat them with ill manners. Back!&quot; Then he retreated to the side   of the street. His guards were angry enough to spit fire from their eyes, but   they dare not disobey him. Reluctantly they retreated to the side of the street   as well. </p>
<p>The they heard the cries of a herd of goats. A young maiden dressed in pale   green robe herded tens of goats down the street. The goats started to go around   the eight Wu swordmen. One swordman was feeling cheated of a good fight, so his   sword moved and a goat was neatly bisected. The cut was so neat that even the   nose of the goat was severed into two precisely equal parts. His seven friends   cheered. Even Feng Li could not fault his sword skill. </p>
<p>The young maiden's bamboo stick moved and herded the rest of goats behind   her. Then she said &quot;Why did you kill my goat?&quot; The voice was feminine and clear,   but it also contained anger. </p>
<p>The goat killer cut his sword into air a few times and laughed &quot;Little girl,   I will cut you into half just like this goat!&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li cried &quot;Lady, please come over here. They are drunk.&quot; </p>
<p>The maiden said &quot;Even if you are drunk, that's no excuse to behave rudely.&quot; </p>
<p>The swordman's sword circled above her head. &quot;I was thinking of cutting off   your head, but now I see you're quite pretty, so I changed my mind.&quot; His seven   friends laughed again. </p>
<p>Feng Li looked at her. She had an oval face, long eyelashes and clear, white   skin. Her face was pretty and her body was slende, even seemingly frail. He   cried again &quot;Lady, over here.&quot; The maiden said &quot;Of course.&quot; </p>
<p>The Wu swordman's sword reached out toward toward her belt. &quot;Why...&quot; Before   he could finished, the maiden's bamboo stick flickered and stabbed into his   wrist. The swordman only felt a sudden pain on his wirst and dropped his sword.   The bamboo stick raised upward, followed by another stab into the swordman's   right eye. The swordman screamed as he covered his blinded eye. </p>
<p>The maiden's movement might be simple, but for some reason, the Wu swordman   could not block or even avoid her bamboo stick. The other seven swordmen was   much surprised. One of them pulled back his sword and thrusted it toward the   maiden's right eye. As the sword sped forward, everyone could hear a loud   whoosh, signaling the strength behind the thrust. </p>
<p>The maiden didn't even move her feet. Her bamboo stick moved again. This time   she stabbed at the swordman's shoulder. The stab was so fast that although it   started after the thrust, it arrived well before the thrust could reach her. The   swordman cried out in pain as all the strength went out of his thrust. Then the   maiden's wrist flicked and the bamboo stick went into his right eye. The   swordman screamed like a butchered pig as his two fists waved aimlessly. </p>
<p>Now, the maiden made four moves and two Wu swordmen were disabled. The   spectator only saw her making some movements with her bamboo stick. Even though   she moved too fast to be seen clearly, but the technique she used was clearly   derived from some sort of high sword skill. Feng was both surprised and   gladdened, but now he saw that the maiden had to face six Wu swordmen. He   hurriedly said &quot;Swordmen of Wu. It would be bad for the honor of Wu if the six   of you gang up on a defenseless girl. Even you win with you superior   numbers......&quot; He clapped his hands together. His guards leaped into the street   and surrounded the Wu swordmen. </p>
<p>The maiden smiled &quot;Even the odds of six against one is not enough for you.&quot;   Her left hand lifted slightly. The bamboo stick on her right hand thrusted   toward yet another swordman's eye. She moved her stick and stabbed toward   another swordman's chest. Three swords sped toward her. She moved agilely and   avoided all three sword, then she counterattacked. One swordman was stabbed on   the wrist and lost hold on his sword. </p>
<p>Feng Li's guard was ready to leap into battle, but they could not penetrate   into the sword net formed by the Wu swordmen. </p>
<p>The maiden moved between the six swordmen. Her long sleeves and long belt   waved in the wind beautifully. Then the cries of pain came from one after   another Wu swordmen as their swords dropped to the ground. The fight was over.   Each of the Wu swordmen lost an eye. Some lost the right eye. Some lost the left   eye. </p>
<p>The maiden pulled back her bamboo stick and said &quot;You killed my goat. Now   compensate me.&quot; </p>
<p>The Wu swordmen were angry and scared. Some were roaring in fury. Some were   shivering in fear. These eight were battle-hardened veterans. Ordinarily they   would not lose control of their demeanor even if someone cut of both of their   hands, but what happened to them was so beyond their comprehension that they had   not idea how they should act. </p>
<p>The maiden said &quot;If you don't compensate me for my goat, I will take your   other eye.&quot; The Wu swordmen jumped back involuntarily. </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Lady, I will give you one hundred goats, but let these eight   men leave.&quot; </p>
<p>The maiden smiled &quot;You're a nice man. I don't want one hundred goats. I only   want one.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said to the guard &quot;Accompany the ambassadors from the Great Kingdom   back to the palace. Summon the physicians to treat their wounds.&quot; The eight Wu   swordmen left crestfallen, like cocks who had lost a fight. </p>
<p>Feng Li walked toward the maiden and said &quot;Lady, what is your respected   surname?&quot; The maiden said &quot;What did you say?&quot; He rephrased the question &quot;What is   your name?&quot; The maiden said &quot;Oh, my name is Ah Ching. What is yours?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li smiled and thought &quot;So she is just a simple country girl unversed in   courtly manners. Yet she learned this godlike sword skill. I only have to learn   who her master is, then I can invite her teacher to train Yueh warriors. Wu will   not be able to stand against us.&quot; His heart warmed as he realized that he's   closer to bring Si Shi back. Then he said &quot;I am called Feng Li. Lady, why don't   you have a meal in my home?&quot; Ah Ching said &quot;No, I have to herd the goats to   pasture.&quot; Feng Li said &quot;I have a large lawn in my home. Your goats can feed   there, then I will compensate you with ten fat goats.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching clapped her hands together and laughed &quot;You have a big lawn? Good,   but I don't want any goat from you. You didn't kill this goat.&quot; She knelt to the   ground and petted the dead goat. Then she said sadly &quot;Old White, bad man killed   you. I can't save you this time.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li ordered his guard &quot;Sew the body back together and bury it next to   this lady's house.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching stood up. Her face was stained by tears, but her eyes was happy.   &quot;Feng Li, you won't let them eat Old White?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Of course not. That's your Old White. No one is permitted to   eat him.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching sighed &quot;You are nice. I always hate to let other people kill my   goats so they can eat the meat, but mother said that unless we sell our goat, we   will not have money for rice.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;From today on, I will ask people to send your mother rice and   good clothes. You don't have to sell your goats anymore.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching became happy and embraced Feng Li &quot;You are a good man.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li held her hand, afraid that she might disappear like some immortal   from legend. The goats followed them back to his mansion. </p>
<p>As Ah Ching herded her goats into the mansion she said &quot;Your house is so   large! How can you live here alone?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li smiled &quot;Yes, I think this house is too big for me. Why don't you come   live here with your mother? Who else do you have in your family?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Just me and my mom. I don't know if my mom wants to come. She   always says that I shouldn't talk to strange man, but you are a good man. You   won't harm us.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li told Ah Ching to leave the goats in the garden and ordered his   servants to pick out the best snacks for Ah Ching. The servants watched in shock   as the goats devoured the expensive flowers in the garden. They were even more   shocked when they observed their master watching the destruction with a happy   smile. </p>
<p>Ah Ching ate the pastries and drank the tea. Feng Li talked with and   discovered that she's innocent of the intrigues of the world. Finally he asked   &quot;Ah Ching, who taught you sword skills?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching's large, clear eyes opened wider and said &quot;Sword skill? No one ever   taught me anything.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;The way you used that bamboo stick. That's sword skill. Who   taught that?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching shook her head &quot;No one. I always knew how to play with the bamboo   stick.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li saw that she was too innocent to lie and thought &quot;Did heaven finally   send down a miracle?&quot; He asked again &quot;Do you know how to play with this bamboo   since you're a child?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;No. When I was thirteen, Grandpa White came to ride my goats.   I wouldn't let him and beat him off with my bamboo stick. He returned with a   bamboo stick. I then fought with him. At first, he always score hits on me and I   can't score hits on him. I play this everyday. Now, I score hits on him most of   the time and he can't score hits on me. He isn't coming back as often now.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng thought he finally hit something and said &quot;Where does this Grandpa White   live? Can you take me to him?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;He lives in the mountains. You can't find him. He usually   comes and find me. I never tried to find him.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;I want to meet him. Is there a way?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Hmm. You can follow me to pasture. We will wait for him on the   mountain side. I don't know when he'll show though.&quot; She sighed &quot;I haven't seen   him for a while now.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said to himself &quot;This is for Yi Kwan and the kingdom of Yueh. A   little goat herding won't hurt.&quot; so he said &quot;Good, I'll accompany you and wait   for Grandpa White.&quot; He thought &quot;Grandpa White must be the sword sage who taught   this girl. He must have loved her youth and innocence, so he used play to teach   her. He could make a young girl into the such a great master, then he could make   our warriors destroy Wu. </p>
<p>After the meal, Feng Li followed her to mountain pastures to her goats. His   subordinates didn't understand the reason. They were all baffled. Day after day,   Feng Li went with Ah Ching to herd goat and sang songs, waiting for Grandpa   White. </p>
<p>On the fifth day, Wen Chung came to Feng Li's mansion and saw a very worried   chamberlain. He asked &quot;I haven't seen Minister Feng for a few days now. The King   is worried and ordered to me to visit. Did Minister Feng come down sick?&quot; </p>
<p>The chamberlain said &quot;Minister Feng is healthy, but...but..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;But?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Minister Wen is the best friend of Miister Feng. You can say things to him   that are not appropriate for us to say. Why don't you try to talk some sense   into him?&quot; </p>
<p>Wen Chung was baffled &quot;Sense? What's wrong with Minister Feng?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Minister Feng fell love with that little shepherdess. Every morning he   leaves with her and don't return until after sundown. He won't permit any guards   following him. He will not be bothered even when I have urgent affairs.&quot; </p>
<p>Wen Chung laughed and thought &quot;When Brother Feng was living in the kingdom of   Chuh, everyone called him Feng the Crazy. He never does things like other   people.&quot; </p>
<p>At that time, Feng Li was sitting on a mountain side grassland and telling Ah   Ching the story of the goddess Hsiang Fei. Ah Ching was sitting close by his   side and listened to him intent, her large bright eyese never left his face.   Suddenly she said &quot;Hsiang Fei is really that beautiful?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;Her eyes are clearer and brighter than the water in this   mountain stream...&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Does she have fish in her eyes?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li continued &quot;Her skin is like the clouds, but fairer.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Are there birds flying in those clouds?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li continued obliviously &quot;Her lips are softer than the petal of this   flower and redder. Her lips are moist, even more than the dews on this petal.   When Hsiang Fei stands next to the river, the beauty of her reflection made all   the riverside flowers wilt in shame. Even fish dare not swim in water for fear   of rumpling her reflection. When her white hand is dipped into the river, it was   so soft that it could almost melt into the water...&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;You saw her, didn't you. How else can you describe her so   clearly?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;I saw her. I saw her very, very clearly.&quot; </p>
<p>Of course, he was referring to Si Shi, not the goddess Hsiang Fei. </p>
<p>He looked at the north. His eyes looked beyond a wide, roaring river. Is the   beauty in the royal palace of Wu. Is she with King Fu Chai? Is she thinking   about me? </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Feng Li! Your beard is strange, can I touch it?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li thought &quot;Is she weeping, or laughing?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Feng Li, you have two strands of white beard, just like my   goats.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li thought &quot;When we're separated, she wept on my shoulder. Her tear   soaked half of my robe. I never washed that robe. My tears were mingled with   hers on that robe.&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching said &quot;Feng Li. Can I pull out one of your beard? I will pull gently.   You won't feel a thing.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li thought &quot;She said she loved riding in a boat and float with the   currents. After I take her back, I will not be a court minister anymore. I will   ride a boat with her, floating in rivers and lakes, for the rest of my life.&quot; </p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his chin. Ah Ching pulled out a strand of   his beard. She laughed prettily. Suddenly the laugh was cut off and she said   &quot;You're here again!&quot; </p>
<p>A green shadow flashed as Ah Ching shot forward. A green blur and a white   blur was moving quickly around each other. </p>
<p>Feng Li cried gladly &quot;Grandpa White's here!&quot; It's a while before the two   combatants slowed down enough for him to get a good look. Then he got a great   surprise. </p>
<p>The one fighting Ah Ching wasn't human. It was a white ape. </p>
<p>The white ape, too, was holding a bamboo stick. The white ape performed   intricate sword forms. The whooshing sound of the stick signaled the great   strength it put into each form. But everytime he attack, Ah Ching was always   able to block or redirect each blow and counterattack using even more intricate   sword forms. </p>
<p>When Ah Ching fought the Wu swordmen, the forms she used were minimal. Only   now Feng Li witnessed the vast skill Ah Ching wielded. He was no expert in   swords, but he had looked at the Yueh swordmen train for many years. Now, he   realized that the best swordmen of Yueh were but children playing with toys when   compared to Ah Ching and Grandpa. </p>
<p>The white ape's attacks sped up faster and faster. Ah Ching slowed down   instead. She stood still, but each time she thrusted with her bamboo stick, the   white ape was forced to jump back. </p>
<p>Ah Ching forced the white ape three steps, then she pulled back her stick and   stood still. The white ape held his stick in two hands and jumped to attack.   Feng Li saw the strength of the attack and cried out &quot;Watch out!&quot; Ah Ching's   stick moved too fast to be seen. There were two muffled sounds of impact, then   the white ape's bamboo stick dropped to the ground. The white ape howed and   jumped up to a tree. Then it leaped away. The howl was intense, but became muter   as the it went farther away. The howl reverberated long after the white ape was   gone. </p>
<p>Ah Ching turned back and sighed &quot;Grandpa broke both of his arms. Now he won't   come play with me anymore.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said &quot;You broke his arms?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching nodded &quot; Grandpa is very angry today. Three times, he tried to leap   over and kill you.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said in surprise &quot;Kill me? Why?&quot; </p>
<p>Ah Ching shook her head &quot;I don't know.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li became scared in secret &quot;If Ah Ching didn't stop it, that white ape   can kill me, easy as blowing away a pile of ash!&quot; </p>
<p>The next morning, Ah Ching faced twenty of the best swordmen of Yueh alone.   Feng Li knew that Ah Ching could not teach other people how to use the sword the   way she did, so the only way was for the Yueh swordmen to imitate her. </p>
<p>The problem was no Yueh swordmen could last three passes from her.Whenever Ah   Ching's bamboo stick moved, her opponent either lost his sword, or got stabbed   in some delicate area. </p>
<p>The next day, she defeated thirty swordmen. The third day, thirty more lost. </p>
<p>The fourth day, Feng Li went to ask her for another lesson, but he could not   find her. He went to her home, but the house was empty. Feng Li sent hundreds of   his servants and guards into the mountains to look for her, but no one could   find any trace of her. </p>
<p>The eighty Yueh swordmen didn't learn the true sword skill from Ah Ching, but   they saw the smallest portion of the ultimate sword skill. All the swordmen now   knew the true height sword skill could go. The eighty swordmen tried to teach   the small portion they could understand to their comrades. Even this pale shadow   of a pale shadow of the ultimate skill was enough, Yueh swordmen became   invincible. </p>
<p>King Kou Chiang ordered Hsieh Chu to forge thousands of sharp swords. </p>
<p>Three years later, Kou Chiang attacked Wu. The armies of Yueh and Wu met next   to a lake. Five thousand Yueh swordmen marched forward. Wu swordmen met them.   Yueh swords flashed and the Wu army was shattered. </p>
<p>King Fu Chai retreated to Yu Hong Mountain. The army of Yueh followed. The   second battle ensued. The Wu army was again defeated. Fu Chai committed suicide   in order to avoid the cruel fate Kou Chiang had in store for him. Yueh took the   capital of Wu. </p>
<p>Feng Li led one thousand swordmen and rushed to King Fu Chai's resort palace.   That was where Si Shi lived. He ran into the palace, shouting &quot;Yi Kwan! Yi   Kwan!&quot; </p>
<p>He ran past a long corridor, his footstep echoed clearly. The corridor was   hollow underneath. Si Shi walked lightly, the rhythm of her steps was more   enchanting than any music. Fu Chai built this palace, this corridor in order to   listen to the melody of her footsteps. </p>
<p>At the other end of the corridor, music came, like the sound of a happy   mandolin, like the clear sound of a zither. A soft voice said &quot;Shao Bo, is that   really you?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li felt blood rushing upward from his chest and shouted &quot;It's I. It's I.   I have come for you.&quot; His own voice seemed like the voice of a stranger,   speaking from far away. He ran forward with uneven steps. </p>
<p>The music came down the corridor, a soft body entered his embrace. </p>
<p>The spring night was meltingly warm. Flower fragrance floated through the   curtains, entering the chambers of the resort palace. Feng Li and Si Shi talked   about their longing for each other. </p>
<p>Suddenly the sound goat penetrated into their awareness. </p>
<p>Feng LI said &quot;You can't forget you homeland? You have goats here?&quot; </p>
<p>Si Shi shook her head. She wondered about the goats, but she couldn't think   of anything else in the presence of the man she loved. She held Feng Li's hand,   and fiery blood flowed faster through their arteries. </p>
<p>Suddenly, the voice of a woman sounded &quot;Feng Li! Bring out you Si Shi. I'll   kill her!&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li stood up. Si Shi felt his palm suddenly turning cold. Feng Li   recognized Ah Ching's voice. Her voice came from outside of the resort palace. </p>
<p>Feng Li was fearful and puzzled. &quot;Why does she want to kill Yi Kwan? Yi Kwan   had never wronged her.&quot; Then he understood &quot;She's not really a simple village   girl. She always liked me.&quot; The understanding only made him more fearful. </p>
<p>He had gone through many, many difficult decisions as well as dangerous   situations. The fear he felt when he was trapped with Kou Chiang in a Wu siege   was far less than what he felt now. Si Shi felt his palm trembbling and covered   with cold sweat. </p>
<p>Feng Li was not afraid of his own death. He feared for Si Shi. </p>
<p>Feng Li pulled himself under control and said &quot;I will go see this person.&quot; He   released Si Shi's hand and walked out of the palace. </p>
<p>Eighteen swordmen followed him. They all heard Ah Ching's cry. They were   baffled and curious. Feng Li oly saw the clear moonlight outside, but no one was   visible. He cried out loudly &quot;Lady Ah Ching, please come here. We have things to   talk about.&quot; But he heard no reply. He waited, but Ah Ching did not come. He   ordered one thousand armored soldiers and one thousand elite swordmen to be   moved to the resort palace. </p>
<p>He returned to Si Shi and held her hands again. He didn't say anything. He   was planning as he never planned before &quot;Should I let one of the servant maids   pretending to be Si Shi and let Ah Ching kill her? Should I commit suicide   before Ah Ching so she will spare Si Shi? Should I order two thousand archers   surrounding this place and shoot Ah Ching full of arrows if she tries to force   her way in?&quot; Every plan he had was flawed. He also didn't want to kill Ah Ching,   who had made the destruction of Wu possible. He stared at Shi Si. Suddenly he   felt warmth in his heart &quot;It's good that we'll die this way. At least we spend   sometime together before we die together.&quot; </p>
<p>Hours passed. Si Shi felt that Feng's hand became warmer. He lost his fear   and began to smile. </p>
<p>The rising sun cast its rays through the window. </p>
<p>Suddenly the the sound of a fight came from outside the palace door. Then the   incessant sound of weapons dropping to the ground. The sound drew closer and   closer, like a giant serpent worming its way into the palace. Then the sound of   dropping weapons came from the walkways just outside the room they were in. Two   thousand warriors were not enough to stop Ah Ching. </p>
<p>Ah Ching's voice said &quot;Feng Li, where are you?&quot; </p>
<p>Feng Li said calmly &quot;Ah Ching, I'm here.&quot; </p>
<p>Before he even finished the word &quot;here&quot;, the curtain parted and a green   shadow came flying in. Ah Ching, dressed in her usual green stood before them.   She pointed her bamboo stick at Si Shi. She stared at the face of Shi Si, the   killing rage on face gradually disappeared, replaced with disappointment and   self-pity, then it changed to surprise, admiration and finally worship. She   whispered &quot;There...there really is such beauty under heaven! Feng Li, she is   even more....more beautiful than you described.&quot; Her slender waist turned. With   a cry, she flew up through the window. The cry went farther and farther until   its reverberation was left. </p>
<p>The surviving guards ran inside the room. One of them bowed &quot;Minister, are   you all right?&quot; Feng Li merely dismissed them with a wave of his hand. Then he   held Si Shi's hand and said &quot;Let's change into the clothes of commners. We'll go   rowing a boat upon Lake Tai and never return to this place.&quot; </p>
<p>Happiness shone from Si Shi's eyes. Suddenly she frowned and she reached   toward her heart. Ah Ching's bamboo stick didn't touch her, but the pure chi   from the stick had reached into her body and did her some slight harm. </p>
<p>In the next two thousand years, all people know that the most beautiful image   in the world was Si Shi holding her hands in front of her bosom. </p>
<h3>Where are they now?</h3>
King Kou Chiang finally got his vengeance, but   something had happened to him during all those years when the only emotion he   could feel was hate. Feng Li must have sensed it. He resigned his post and told   his buddy Wen Chung to resign with him. He said &quot;Kou Chiang is someone who you   can depend on during hard times, but it will be impossible to share good times   with him.&quot; Wen Chung didn't believe his old friend. He believed that he could   finally enjoy the rewards he deserved.
<p>Feng Li disappeared from history. Some said that he became a hermit. Some   said that he became a merchant prince who owned the wealth of kingdoms. Si Shi   became the Chinese version of Helen, the beauty who destroyed a great kingdom.   Some said that Si Shi went with Feng Li and they lived happily ever after. Some   said that Si Shi died when Kou Chiang's wife, fearing losing her husband, tied a   rock to the woman's back and sank her in a lake, gloating &quot;Now, you never have   to grow old.&quot; You can pick the ending you prefer. </p>
<p>Kou Chiang became as Feng Li predicted, cruel and merciless. Wen Chung was   forced to commit suicide when he was wrongfully charged with treason. The end he   inflicted upon Wu Tzu-shi became his own end. Kou Chiang became full of pride.   He made war with the great powers of northern China. The wars brought no   decisive victory. Then he died. After his death his kingdom fell apart.   Eventually, Chuh absorbed the territories of Wu and Yueh. The Yueh people fled   south. Over the centuries, they were pushed farther south by the expanding   Chinese empire until they entered present day Vietnam. They are there still. </p>
<p>Recently, an archaeological excavation in Hunan uncovered two bronze swords.   One of them was thought to be the sword of Fu Chai. The other was attributed to   be the sword owned by Kou Chiang. The legends of the precious swords have some   basis in fact. If anyone know more about the archaeological findings, please   e-mail me. The swords Fish Intestine and Defeater of Evil were buried with King   Ho Lu, Fu Chai's father. The locals swore that they periodically saw a white   tiger standing upon the tomb of Ho Lu. The white tiger was the symbol of metal,   so the locals believe that the tiger was the personification of the magic swords   under there. Believe it or not. </p>
<p>As for the Yueh Maiden, she never existed in real history. She always existed   in the land of legends and there, presumably, she roams still. Doubtlessly she   has performed many great deeds there, deeds which will remain unknown until some   scribe comes and tell the tales as they deserve to be told. </p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>“请！”</p><p>“请！”<p/>
<p> 
两名剑士各自倒转剑尖，右手握剑柄，左手搭于右手手背，躬身行礼。<p/>
<p>   
两人身子尚未站直，突然间白光闪动，跟着铮的一声响，双剑相交，两人各退一步。旁观众人都是“咦”的一声轻呼。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士连劈三剑，锦衫剑士一一格开。青衣剑士一声吒喝，长剑从左上角直划而下，势劲力急。锦衫剑士身手矫捷，向后跃开，避过了这剑。他左足刚着地，身子跟着弹起，刷刷两剑，向对手攻去。青衣剑士凝里不动，嘴角边微微冷笑，长剑轻摆，挡开来剑。<p/>
<p>   
锦衫剑士突然发足疾奔，绕着青衣剑士的溜溜的转动，脚下越来越快。青衣剑士凝视敌手长剑剑尖，敌剑一动，便挥剑击落。锦衫剑士忽而左转，忽而右转，身法变幻不定。青衣剑士给他转得微感晕眩，喝道：“你是比剑，还是逃命？”刷刷两剑，直削过去。但锦衫剑士奔转甚急，剑到之时，人已离开，敌剑剑锋总是和他身子差了尺许。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士回剑侧身，右腿微蹲，锦衫剑士看出破绽，挺剑向他左肩疾刺。不料青衣剑士这一蹲乃是诱招，长剑突然圈转，直取敌人咽喉，势道劲急无伦。锦衫剑士大骇之下，长剑脱手，向敌人心窝激射过去。这是无可奈何同归于尽的打法，敌人若是继续进击，心窝必定中剑。当此情形，对方自须收剑挡格，自己便可摆脱这无可挽救的绝境。<p/>
<p>   
不料青衣剑士竟不挡架闪避，手腕抖动，噗的一声，剑尖刺入了锦衫剑士的咽喉。跟着当的一响，掷来的长剑刺中了他胸膛，长剑落地。青衣剑士嘿嘿一笑，收剑退立，原来他衣内胸口藏着一面护心铁镜，剑尖虽是刺中，却是丝毫无伤。那锦衫剑士喉头鲜血激喷，身子在地下不住扭曲。当下便有从者过来抬开尸首，抹去地下血迹。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士还剑入鞘，跨前两步，躬身向北首高坐于锦披大椅中的一位王者行礼。<p/>
<p>   
那王者身披锦袍，形貌拙异，头颈甚长，嘴尖如鸟，微微一笑，嘶声道：“壮士剑法精妙，赐金十斤。”青衣剑士右膝跪下，躬身说道：“谢赏！”那王者左手一挥，他右首一名高高瘦瘦、四十来岁的官员喝道：“吴越剑士，二次比试！”<p/>
<p>   
东首锦衫剑士队走出一条身材魁梧的汉子，手提大剑。这剑长逾五尺，剑身极厚，显然份量甚重。西首走出一名青衣剑士，中等身材，脸上尽是剑疤，东一道、西一道，少说也有十二三道，一张脸已无复人性，足见身经百战，不知已和人比过多少次剑了。二人先向王者屈膝致敬，然后转过身来，相向而立，躬身行礼。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士站直身子，脸露狞笑。他一张脸本已十分丑陋，这么一笑，更显得说不出的难看。锦衫剑士见了他如鬼似魅的模样，不由得机伶伶打个冷战，波的一声，吐了口长气，慢慢伸过左手，搭住剑柄。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士突然一声狂叫，声如狼嗥，挺剑向对手急刺过去。锦衫剑士也是纵声大喝，提起大剑，对着他当头劈落。青衣剑士斜身闪开，长剑自左而右横削过去。那锦衫剑士双手使剑，一柄大剑舞得呼呼作响。这大剑少说也有五十来斤重，但他招数仍是迅捷之极。<p/>
<p>   
两人一搭上手，顷刻间拆了三十来招，青衣剑士被他沉重的剑力压得不住倒退。站在大殿西首的五十余名锦衫剑士人人脸有喜色，眼见这场比试是赢定了。<p/>
<p>   
只听得锦衫剑士一声大喝，声若雷震，大剑横扫过去。青衣剑士避无可避，提长剑奋力挡格。当的一声响，双剑相交，半截大剑飞了出去，原来青衣剑士手中长剑锋利无比，竟将大剑斩为两截，那利剑跟着直划而下，将锦衫剑士自咽喉而至小腹，划了一道两尺来长的口子。锦衫剑士连声狂吼，扑倒在地。青衣剑士向地下魁梧的身形凝视片刻，这才还剑入鞘，屈膝向王者行礼，脸上掩不住得意之色。<p/>
<p>   
王者身旁的一位官员道：“壮士剑利术精，大王赐金十斤。”青衣剑士称谢退开。<p/>
<p>   
西首一列排着八名青衣剑士，与对面五十余名锦衫剑士相比，众寡甚是悬殊。<p/>
<p>   
那官员缓缓说道：“吴越剑士，三次比剑！”两队剑士队中各走出一人，向王者行礼后相向而立。突然青光耀眼，众人均觉寒气袭体。但见那青衣剑士手中一柄三尺长剑不住颤动，便如一根闪闪发出丝光的缎带。那官员赞道：“好剑！”青衣剑士微微躬身为礼，谢他称赞。那官员道：“单打独斗已看了两场，这次两个对两个！”<p/>
<p>   
锦衫剑士队中一人应声而出，拔剑出鞘。那剑明亮如秋水，也是一口利器。青衣剑士队中又出来一人。四人向王者行过礼后，相互行礼，跟着剑光闪烁，斗了起来。这二对二的比剑，同伙剑士互相照应配合。数合之后，嗤的一声，一名锦衫剑士手中长剑竟被敌手削断。这人极是悍勇，提着半截断剑，飞身向敌人扑去。那青衣剑士长剑闪处，嗤的一声响，将他右臂齐肩削落，跟着补上一剑，刺中他的心窝。<p/>
<p>   
另外二人兀自缠斗不休，得胜的青衣剑士窥伺在旁，突然间长剑递出，嗤的一声，又就锦衫剑士手中长剑削断。另一人长剑中宫直进，自敌手胸膛贯入，背心穿出。<p/>
<p>   
那王者呵呵大笑，拍手说道：“好剑，好剑法！赏酒，赏金！咱们再来瞧一场四个对四个的比试。”<p/>
<p>   
两边队中各出四人，行过礼后，出剑相斗。锦衫剑士连输三场，死了四人，这时下场的四人狠命相扑，说什么也要赢回一场。只见两名青衣剑士分从左右夹击一名锦衫剑士。余下三名锦衫剑士上前邀战，却给两名青衣剑士挡住，这两名青衣剑士取的纯是守势，招数严密，竟一招也不还击，却令三名锦衫剑士无法过去相援同伴，余下两名青衣剑士以二对一，十余招间便将对手杀死，跟着便攻向另一名锦衫剑士。先前两名青衣剑士仍使旧法，只守不攻，挡住两名锦衫剑士，让同伴以二对一，杀死敌手。<p/>
<p>   
旁观的锦衫剑士眼见同伴只剩下二人，胜负之数已定，都大声鼓噪起来，纷纷拔剑，便欲一拥而上，就八名青衣剑士乱剑分尸。<p/>
<p>   
那官员朗声道：“学剑之士，当守剑道！”他神色语气之中有一股凛然之威，一众锦衫剑士立时都静了下来。<p/>
<p>   
这时众人都已看得分明，四名青衣剑士的剑法截然不同，二人的守招严密无比，另二人的攻招却是凌厉狠辣，分头合击，守者缠住敌手，只剩下一人，让攻者以众凌寡，逐一蚕食杀戮。以此法迎敌，纵然对方武功较高，青衣剑士一方也必操胜算。别说四人对四人，即使是四人对六人甚或八人，也能取胜。那二名守者的剑招施展开来，便如是一道剑网，纯取守势，要挡住五六人实是绰绰有余。<p/>
<p>   
这时场中两名青衣剑士仍以守势缠住了一名锦衫剑士，另外两名青衣剑士快剑攻击，杀死第三名锦衫剑士后，转而向第四名敌手相攻。取守势的两名青衣剑士向左右分开，在旁掠阵。余下一名锦衫剑士虽见败局已成，却不肯弃剑投降，仍是奋力应战。突然间四名青衣剑士齐声大喝，四剑并出，分从前后左右，一齐刺在锦衫剑士的身上。<p/>
<p>   
锦衫剑士身中四剑，立时毙命，只见他双目圆睁，嘴巴也是张得大大的。四名青衣剑士同时拔剑，四人抬起左脚，将长剑剑刃在鞋底一拖，抹去了血渍，刷的一声，还剑入鞘。这几下动作干净利落，固不待言，最难得的是齐整之极，同时抬脚，同时拖剑，回剑入鞘却只发出一下声响。<p/>
<p>   
那王者呵呵大笑，鼓掌道：“好剑法，好剑法！上国剑士名扬天下，可教我们今日大开眼界了。四位剑士各赐金十斤。”四名青衣剑士一齐躬身谢赏。四人这么一弯腰，四个脑袋摆成一道直线，不见有丝毫高低，实不知花了多少功夫才练得如此划一。<p/>
<p>   
一名青衣剑士转过身去，捧起一只金漆长匣，走上几步，说道：“敝国君王多谢大王厚礼，命臣奉上宝剑一口还答，此剑乃敝国新铸，谨供大王玩赏。”<p/>
<p>   
那王者笑道：“多谢了。范大夫，接过来看看。”<p/>
<p>   
那王者是越王勾践。那官员是越国大夫范蠡。锦衫剑士是越王宫中的卫士，八名青衣剑士则是吴王夫差派来送礼的使者。越王昔日为夫差所败，卧薪尝胆，欲报此仇，面子上对吴王十分恭顺，暗中却日夜不停的训练士卒，俟机攻吴。他为了试探吴国军力，连出卫士中的高手和吴国剑士比剑，不料一战之下，八名越国好手尽数被歼。勾践又惊又怒，脸上却不动声色，显得对吴国剑士的剑法欢喜赞叹，衷心钦服。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡走上几步，接过了金漆长匣，只觉轻飘飘地，匣中有如无物，当下打开了匣盖。旁边众人没见到匣中装有何物，却见范蠡的脸上陡然间罩上了一层青色薄雾，都是“哦”的一声，甚感惊讶。当真是剑气映面，发眉俱碧。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡托着漆匣，走到越王身前，躬身道：“大王请看！”勾践见匣中铺以锦缎，放着一柄三尺长剑，剑身极薄，刃上宝光流动，变幻不定，不由得赞道：“好剑！”握住剑柄，提了起来，只见剑刃不住颤动，似乎只须轻轻一抖，便能折断，心想：“此剑如此单薄，只堪观赏，并无实用。”<p/>
<p>   
那为首的青衣剑士从怀中取出一块轻纱，向上抛起，说道：“请大王平伸剑刃，剑锋向上，待纱落在剑上，便见此剑与众不同。”眼见一块轻纱从半空中飘飘扬扬的落将下来，越王平剑伸出，轻纱落在剑上，不料下落之势并不止歇，轻纱竟已分成两块，缓缓落地。原来这剑已将轻纱划而为二，剑刃之利，实是匪夷所思。殿上殿下，采声雷动。<p/>
<p>   
青衣剑士说道：“此剑虽薄，但与沉重兵器相碰，亦不折断。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践道：“范大夫，拿去试来。”范蠡道：“是！”双手托上剑匣，让勾践将剑放入匣中，倒退数步，转身走到一名锦衫剑士面前，取剑出匣，说道：“拔剑，咱们试试！”<p/>
<p>   
那锦衫剑士躬身行礼，拔出佩剑，举在空中，不敢下击。范蠡叫道：“劈下！”锦衫剑士道：“是！”挥剑劈下，落剑处却在范蠡身前一尺。范蠡提剑向上一撩，嗤的一声轻响，锦衫剑士手中的长剑已断为两截。半截断剑落下，眼见便要碰到范蠡身上，范蠡轻轻一跃避开。众人又是一声采，却不知是称赞剑利，还是范大夫身手敏捷。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡将剑放回匣中，躬身放在越王脚边。<p/>
<p>   
勾践说道：“上国剑士，请赴别座饮宴领赏。”八名青衣剑士行礼下殿。勾践手一挥，锦衫剑士和殿上侍从也均退下，只除下范蠡一人。<p/>
<p>   
勾践瞧瞧脚边长剑，又瞧瞧满地鲜血，只是出神，过了半晌，道：“怎样？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡道：“吴国武士剑术，未必尽如这八人之精，吴国武士所用兵刃，未必尽如此剑之利。但观此一端，足见其余。最令人心忧的是，吴国武士群战之术，妙用孙武子兵法，臣以为当今之世，实乃无敌于天下。”勾践沉吟道：“夫差派这八人来送宝剑，大夫你看是何用意？”范蠡道：“那是要咱们知难而退，不可起侵吴报仇之心。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践大怒，一弯身，从匣中抓起宝剑，回手一挥，察的一声响，将坐椅平平整整的切去了一截，大声道：“便有千难万难，勾践也决不知难而退。终有一日，我要擒住夫差，便用此剑将他脑袋砍了下来！”说着又是一剑，将一张檀木椅子一劈为二。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡躬身道：“恭喜大王，贺喜大王！”勾践愕然道：“眼见吴国剑士如此了得，又有甚么喜可贺？”范蠡道：“大王说道便有千难万难，也决不知难而退。大王即有此决心，大事必成。眼前这难事，还须请文大夫共同商议。”勾践道：“好，你去传文大夫来。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡走下殿去，命宫监去传大夫文种，自行站在宫门之侧相候。过不多时，文种飞马赶到，与范蠡并肩入宫。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡本是楚国宛人，为人倜傥，不拘小节，所作所为，往往出人意表，当地人士都叫他“范疯子”。文种来到宛地做县令，听到范蠡的名字，便派部属去拜访。那部属见了范蠡，回来说道：“这人是本地出名的疯子，行事乱七八糟。”文种笑道：“一个人有与众不同的行为，凡人必笑他胡闹，他有高明独特的见解，庸人自必骂他糊涂。你们又怎能明白范先生呢？”便亲自前去拜访。范避而不见，但料到他必定去而复来，向兄长借了衣冠，穿戴整齐。果然过了几个时辰，文种又再到来。两人相见之后，长谈王霸之道，投机之极，当真是相见恨晚。<p/>
<p>   
两人都觉中原诸国暮气沉沉，楚国邦大而乱，眼前霸兆是在东南。于是文种辞去官位，与范蠡同往吴国。其时吴王正重用伍子胥的种种兴革措施确是才识卓越。自己未必胜得他过。两人一商量，以越国和吴国邻近，风俗相似，虽然地域较小，却也大可一显身手，于是来到越国。勾践接见之下，于二人议论才具颇为赏识，均拜为大夫之职。<p/>
<p>   
后来勾践不听文种、范蠡劝谏，兴兵和吴国交战，以石买为将，在钱塘江边一战大败，勾践在会稽山被围，几乎亡国殒身。勾践在危机之中用文种、范蠡之计，买通了吴王身边的奸臣太宰伯pi，替越王陈说。吴王夫差不听伍子胥的忠谏，答允与越国讲和，将勾践带到吴国，后来又放他归国。其后勾践卧薪尝胆，决定复仇，采用了文种的灭吴九术。<p/>
<p>   
那九术第一是尊天地，事鬼神，令越王有必胜之心。第二是赠送吴王大量财币，既是他习于奢侈，又去其防越之意。第三是先向吴国借粮，再以蒸过的大谷归还，吴王见谷大，发给农民当谷种，结果稻不生长，吴国大饥。第四是赠送美女西施和郑旦，使吴王迷恋美色，不理政事。第五是赠送巧匠，引诱吴王大起宫室高台，耗其财力民力。第六是贿赂吴王左右的奸臣，使之败坏朝政，第七是离间吴王的忠臣，终于迫得伍子胥自杀。第八是积蓄粮草，充实国家财力。第九是铸造武器，训练士卒，待机攻吴。<p/>
<p>   
八术都已成功，最后的第九术却在这时遇上了重大困难。眼见吴王派来剑士八人，所显示的兵刃之利、剑术之精，实非越国武士所能匹敌。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡将适才比剑的情形告知了文种。文种皱眉道：“范贤弟，吴国剑士剑利术精。固是大患，而他们在群斗之时，善用孙武子遗法，更是难破难当。”范蠡道：“正是，当年孙武子辅佐吴王，统兵破楚，攻入郢都，用兵如神，天下无敌。虽齐晋大国，亦畏其锋，他兵法有言道：'我专为一，敌分为十，是以十攻其一也，则我众而敌寡。能以众击寡者，则吾之所与战者，约矣。'吴士四人与我越士四人相斗，吴士以二人专攻一人，以众击寡，战无不胜。”<p/>
<p>   
言谈之间，二人到了越王面前，只见勾践手中提着那柄其薄如纸的利剑，兀自出神。<p/>
<p>   
过了良久，勾践抬起头来，说道：“文大夫，当年吴国有干将莫邪夫妇，善于铸剑。我越国有良工欧治子，铸剑之术，亦不下于彼。此时干将、莫邪、欧治子均已不在人世。吴国有这等铸剑高手，难道我越国自欧治子一死，就此后继无人吗？”文种道：“臣闻欧治子传有弟子二人，一名风胡子，一名薛烛。风胡子在楚，薛烛尚在越国。”勾践大喜，道：“大夫速召薛烛前来，再遣人入楚，以重金聘请风胡子来越。”文种遵命而退。<p/>
<p>   
次日清晨，文种回报已遣人赴楚，薛烛则已宣到。<p/>
<p>   
勾践召见薛烛，说道：“你师父欧治子曾奉先王之命，铸剑五口。这五口宝剑的优劣，你倒说来听听。”薛烛磕头道：“小人曾听先师言道，先师为先王铸剑五口，大剑三，小剑二，一曰湛卢，二曰纯钧，三曰胜邪，四曰鱼肠，五曰巨阙。至今湛卢在楚，胜邪、鱼肠在吴，纯钧、巨阙二剑则在大王宫中。”勾践道：“正是。”<p/>
<p>   
原来当年勾践之父越王允常铸成五剑后，吴王得讯，便来相求。允常畏吴之强，只得以湛卢、胜邪、鱼肠三剑相献。后来吴王阖庐以鱼肠剑遣专诸刺杀王僚。湛卢剑落入水中，后为楚王所得，秦王闻之，求而不得，兴师击楚，楚王始终不与。<p/>
<p>   
薛烛禀道：“兴师曾言，五剑之中，胜邪最上，纯钧、湛卢二剑其次，鱼肠又次之，巨阙居末。铸巨阙之时，金锡和铜而离，因此此剑只是利剑，而非宝剑。”勾践道：“然则我纯钧、巨阙二剑，不敌吴王之胜邪、鱼肠二剑了？”薛烛道：“小人死罪，恕小人直言。”勾践抬头不语，从薛烛这句话中，已知越国二剑自非吴国二剑之敌。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡说道：“你既得传尊师之术，可即开炉铸剑。铸将几口宝剑出来，未必便及不上吴国的宝剑。”薛烛道：“回禀大夫：小人已不能铸剑了。”范蠡道：“却是为何？”薛烛伸出手来，只见他双手的拇指食指具已不见，只剩下六根手指。薛烛黯然道：“铸剑之劲，全仗拇指食指。小人苟延残喘，早已成为废人。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践奇道：“你这四根手指，是给仇家割去的么？”薛烛道：“不是仇家，是给小人的师兄割去的。”勾践更加奇怪，道：“你的师兄，那不是风胡子么？他为甚么要割你手指？啊，一定是你铸剑之术胜过师兄，他心怀妒忌，断你手指，教你再也不能铸剑。”勾践自加推测，薛烛不便说他猜错，只有默然不语。<p/>
<p>   
勾践道：“寡人本要派人到楚国去召风胡子来。他怕你报仇，或许不敢回来。”薛烛道：“大王明鉴，风师兄目下是在吴国，不在楚国。”勾践微微一惊，说道：“他……他在吴国，在吴国干甚么？”<p/>
<p>   
薛烛道：“三年之前，风师兄来到小人家中，取出宝剑一口，给小人观看。小人一见之下，登时大惊，原来这口宝剑，乃先师欧治子为楚国所铸，名曰工布，剑身上文如流水，自柄至尖，连绵不断。小人曾听先师说过，一见便知。当年先师为楚王铸剑三口，一曰龙渊、二曰泰阿、三曰工布。楚王宝爱异常，岂知竟为师哥所得。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践道：“想必是楚王赐给你师兄了。”<p/>
<p>   
薛烛道：“若说是楚王所赐，原也不错，只不过是转了两次手。风师兄言道，吴师破楚之后，伍子胥发楚平王之棺，鞭其遗尸，在楚王墓中得此宝剑。后来回吴之后，听到风师兄的名字，便叫人将剑送去楚国给他，说道此是先师遗泽，该由风师兄承受。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践又是一惊，沉吟道：“伍子胥居然舍得此剑，此人真乃英雄，真乃英雄也！”突然间哈哈大笑，说道：“幸好夫差中我之计，已逼得此人自杀，哈哈，哈哈！”<p/>
<p>   
勾践长笑之时，谁都不敢作声。他笑了好一会，才问：“伍子胥将工布宝剑赠你师兄，要办甚么事？”薛烛道：“风师兄言道，当时伍子胥只说仰慕先师，别无所求。风师兄得到此剑后，心下感激，寻思伍将军是吴国上卿，赠我希世珍宝，岂可不去当面叩谢？于是便去到吴国，向伍将军致谢。伍将军待以上宾之礼，替风师兄置下房舍，招待极是客气。”勾践道：“伍子胥叫人为他卖命，用的总是这套手段，当年叫专诸刺王僚，便是如此。”<p/>
<p>   
薛烛道：“大王料事如神。但风师兄不懂得伍子胥的阴谋，受他如此厚待，心下过意不去，一再请问，有何用己之处。伍子胥总说：'阁下枉驾过吴，乃是吴国嘉宾，岂敢劳动尊驾？'”勾践骂道：“老奸巨滑，以退为进！”薛烛道：“大王明见万里。风师兄终于对伍子胥说，他别无所长，只会铸剑，承蒙如此厚待，当铸造几口希世的宝剑相赠。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践伸手在大腿上一拍，道：“着了道儿啦！”薛烛道：“那伍子胥却说，吴国宝剑已多，也不必再铸了。而且铸剑极耗心力，当年干将莫邪铸剑不成，莫邪自身投入剑炉，宝剑方成。这种惨事，万万不可再行。”勾践奇道：“他当真不要风胡子铸剑？那可奇了。”薛烛道：“当时风师兄也觉奇怪。一日伍子胥又到宾馆来和风师兄闲谈，说起吴国与北方齐晋两国争霸，吴士勇悍，时占上风，便是车战之术有所不及，若与之以徒兵步战，所用剑戟又不够锋锐。风师兄便与之谈论铸造剑戟之法。原来伍子胥所要铸的，不是一口两口宝剑，而是千口万口利剑。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践登时省悟，忍不住“啊哟”一声，转眼向文种、范蠡二人瞧去，只见文种满脸焦虑之色，范蠡却是呆呆出神，问道：“范大夫，你以为如何？”范蠡道：“伍子胥虽然诡计多端，别说此人已死，就算仍在世上，也终究逃不脱大王的掌心。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践笑道：“嘿嘿，只怕寡人不是伍子胥的对手。”范蠡道：“伍子胥已被大王巧计除去，难道他还能奈何我越国吗？”勾践呵呵大笑，道：“这话倒也不错。薛烛，你师兄听了伍子胥之言，便助他铸造利剑了？”薛烛道：“正是。风师哥当下便随着伍子胥，来到莫干山上的铸剑房，只见有一千余名剑匠正在铸剑，只是其法未见其善，于是风师兄逐一点拨，此后吴剑锋利，诸国莫及。”勾践点头道：“原来如此。”<p/>
<p>   
薛烛道：“铸得一年，风师哥劳瘁过度，精力不支，便向伍子胥说起小人名字，伍子胥备下礼物，要风师哥来召小人前往吴国，相助风师哥铸剑。小人心想吴越世仇，吴国铸了利剑，固能杀齐人晋人，也能杀我越人，便劝风师哥休得再回吴国。”勾践道：“是啊，你这人甚有见识。”<p/>
<p>   
薛烛磕头道：“多谢大王奖勉。可是风师哥不听小人之劝，当晚他睡在小人家中，半夜之中，他突然以利剑架在小人颈中，再砍去了小人四根手指，好教小人从此成为废人。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践大怒，厉声说道：“下次捉到风胡子，定将他斩成肉酱。”<p/>
<p>   
文种道：“薛先生，你自己虽不能铸剑，但指点剑匠，咱们也能铸成千口万口利剑。”薛烛道：“回禀文大夫：铸剑之铁，吴越均有，唯精铜在越，良锡在吴。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡道：“伍子胥早已派兵守住锡山，不许百姓采锡，是不是？”薛烛脸现惊异之色，道：“范大夫，原来你早知道了。”范蠡微笑道：“我只是猜测而已，现下伍子胥已死，他的遗命吴人未必遵守。高价收购，要得良锡也是不难。”<p/>
<p>   
勾践道：“然而远水救不着近火，待得采铜、炼锡、造炉、铸剑，铸得不好又要从头来起，少说也是两三年的事。如果夫差活不到这么久，岂不成终生之恨？”<p/>
<p>   
文种、范蠡同时躬身道：“是。臣等当再思良策。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡退出宫来，寻思：“大王等不得两三年，我是连多等一日一夜，也是……”想到这里，胸口一阵隐隐发痛，脑海中立刻出现了那个惊世绝艳的丽影。<p/>
<p>   
那是浣纱溪畔的西施。是自己亲去访寻来的天下无双美女夷光，自己却亲身将她送入了吴宫。<p/>
<p>   
从会稽到姑苏的路程很短，只不过几天的水程，但便在这短短的几天之中，两人情根深种，再也难分难舍。西施皓洁的脸庞上，垂着两颗珍珠一般的泪珠，声音像若耶溪中温柔的流水：“少伯，你答应我，一定要接我回来，越快越好，我日日夜夜的在等着你。你再说一遍，你永远永远不会忘了我。”<p/>
<p>   
越国的仇非报不可，那是可以等的。但夷光在夫差的怀抱之中，妒忌和苦恼在咬啮着他的心。必须尽快大批铸造利剑，比吴国剑士所用利剑更加锋锐……<p/>
<p>   
他在街上漫步，十八名卫士远远在后面跟着。<p/>
<p> 
突然间长街西首传来一阵吴歌合唱：“我剑利兮敌丧胆，我剑捷兮敌无首……”<p/>
<p>   
八名身穿青衣的汉子，手臂挽着手臂，放喉高歌，旁若无人的大踏步过来。行人都避在一旁。那正是昨日在越宫中大获全胜的吴国剑士，显然喝了酒，在长街上横冲直撞。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡皱起了眉头，愤怒迅速在胸口升起。<p/>
<p>   
八名吴国剑士走到了范蠡身前。为首一人醉眼惺忪，斜睨着他，说道：“你……你是范大夫……哈哈，哈哈，哈哈！”范蠡的两名卫士抢了上来，挡在范蠡身前，喝道：“不得无礼，闪开了！”八名剑士纵声大笑，学着他们的声调，笑道：“不得无礼，闪开了！”两名卫士抽出长剑，喝道：“大王有命，冲撞大夫者斩！”<p/>
<p>   
为首的吴国剑士身子摇摇晃晃，说道：“斩你，还是斩我？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡心想：“这是吴国使臣，虽然无礼，不能跟他们动手。”正要说：“让他过去！”突然间白光闪动，两名卫士齐声惨叫，跟着当当两声响，两人右手手掌随着所握长剑都已掉在地下。那为首的吴国剑士缓缓还剑入鞘，满脸傲色。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡手下的十六名卫士一齐拔剑出鞘，团团将八名吴国剑士围住。<p/>
<p>   
为首的吴士仰天大笑，说道：“我们从姑苏来到会稽，原是不想再活着回去，且看你越宫要动用多少军马，来杀我吴国八名剑士。”说到最后一个“士”字时，一声长啸，八人同时执剑在手，背靠背的站在一起。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡心想：“小不忍则乱大谋，眼下我国准备未周，不能杀了这八名吴士，致与夫差起衅。”喝道：“这八名是上国使者，大家不得无礼，退开了！”说着让在道旁。他手下卫士都是怒气填膺，眼中如要喷出火来，只是大夫有令，不敢违抗，当即也都让在街边。<p/>
<p>   
八名吴士哈哈大笑，齐声高歌：“我剑利兮敌丧胆，我剑捷兮敌无首！”<p/>
<p>   
忽听得咩咩羊叫，一个身穿浅绿衫子的少女赶着十几头山羊，从长街东端走来。这群山羊来到吴士之前，便从他们身边绕过。<p/>
<p>   
一名吴士兴犹未尽，长剑一挥，将一头山羊从头至臀，剖为两半，便如是划定了线仔细切开一般，连鼻子也是一分为二，两片羊身分倒左右，剑术之精，实是骇人听闻。七名吴士大声喝彩。范蠡心中也忍不住叫一声：“好剑法！”<p/>
<p>   
那少女手中竹棒连挥，将余下的十几头山羊赶到身后，说道：“你为甚么杀我山羊？”声音又娇嫩，也含有几分愤怒。<p/>
<p>   
那杀羊吴士将溅着羊血的长剑在空中连连虚劈，笑道：“小姑娘，我要将你也这样劈为两半！”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡叫道：“姑娘，你快过来，他们喝醉了酒。”<p/>
<p> 
那少女道：“就算喝醉了酒，也不能随便欺侮人。”<p/>
<p>   
那吴国剑士举剑在她头顶绕了几个圈子，笑道：“我本想将你这小脑袋瓜儿割了下来，只是瞧你这么漂亮，可当真舍不得。”七名吴士一齐哈哈大笑。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡见这少女一张瓜子脸，睫长眼大，皮肤白晰，容貌甚是秀丽，身材苗条，弱质纤纤，心下不忍，又叫：“姑娘，快过来！”那少女转头应声道：“是了！”<p/>
<p>   
那吴国剑士长剑探出，去割她腰带，笑道：“那也……”只说得两个字，那少女手中竹棒一抖，戳在他手腕之上。那剑士只觉腕上一阵剧痛，呛啷一声，长剑落地。那少女竹棒挑起，碧影微闪，已刺入他左眼之中。那剑士大叫一声，双手捧住了眼睛，连声狂吼。<p/>
<p>   
这少女这两下轻轻巧巧的刺出，戳腕伤目，行若无事，不知如何，那吴国剑士竟是避让不过。余下七名吴士大吃一惊，一名身材魁梧的吴士提起长剑，剑尖也往少女左眼刺去。剑招嗤嗤有声，足见这一剑劲力十足。<p/>
<p>   
那少女更不避让，竹棒刺出，后发先至，噗的一声，刺中了那吴士的右肩。那吴士这一剑之劲立时卸了。那少女竹棒挺出，已刺入他右眼之中。那人杀猪般的大嗥，双拳乱挥乱打，眼中鲜血涔涔而下，神情甚是可怖。<p/>
<p>   
这少女以四招戳瞎两名吴国剑士的眼睛，人人眼见她只是随手挥刺，对手便即受伤，无不耸然动容。六名吴国剑士又惊又怒，各举长剑，将那少女围在核心。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡略通剑术，眼见这少女不过十六七岁年纪，只用一根竹棒便戳瞎了两名吴国高手的眼睛，手法如何虽然看不清楚，但显是极上乘的剑法，不由得又惊又喜，待见六名剑士各挺兵刃围住了她，，心想她剑术再精，一个少女终是难敌六名高手，当即郎声说道：“吴国众位剑士，六个打一个，不怕坏了吴国的名声？倘若以多为胜，嘿嘿！”双手一拍，十六名越国卫士立即挺剑散开，围住了吴国剑士。<p/>
<p>   
那少女冷笑道：“六个打一个，也未必会赢！”左手微举，右手中的竹棒已向一名吴士眼中戳去。那人举剑挡格，那少女早已兜转竹棒，戳向另一名吴士胸口。便在此时，三名吴士的长剑齐向那少女身上刺到。那少女身法灵巧之极，一转一侧，将来剑尽数避开，噗的一声，挺棒戳中左首一名吴士的手腕。那人五指不由自主的松了，长剑落地。<p/>
<p>   
十六名越国卫士本欲上前自外夹击，但其时吴国剑士长剑使开，已然幻成一道剑网，青光闪烁，那些越国卫士如何欺得近身？<p/>
<p>   
却见那少女在剑网之中飘忽来去，浅绿色布衫的衣袖和带子飞扬开来，好看已极，但听得“啊哟”、呛啷之声不断，吴国众剑士长剑一柄柄落地，一个个退开，有的举手按眼，有的蹲在地下，每一人都被刺瞎了一只眼睛，或伤左目，或损右目。<p/>
<p>   
那少女收棒而立，娇声道：“你们杀了我羊儿，赔是不赔？”<p/>
<p>   
八名吴国剑士又是惊骇，又是愤怒，有的大声咆哮，有的全身发抖。这八人原是极为勇悍的吴士，即使给人砍去了双手双足，也不会害怕示弱，但此刻突然之间为一个牧羊少女所败，实在摸不着半点头脑，震骇之下，心中都是一团混乱。<p/>
<p>   
那少女道：“你们不赔我羊儿，我连你们另一只眼睛也戳瞎了。”八剑士一听，不约而同的都退了一步。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡叫道：“这位姑娘，我赔你一百只羊，这八个人便放他们去吧！”那少女向他微微一笑，道：“你这人很好，我也不要一百只羊，只要一只就够了。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡向卫士道：“护送上国使者回宾馆休息，请医生医治伤目。”卫士答应了，派出八人，挺剑押送。八名吴士手无兵刃，便如打败了的公鸡，垂头丧气的走开。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡走上几步，问道：“姑娘尊姓？”那少女道：“你说甚么？”范蠡道：“姑娘姓甚么？”那少女道：“我叫阿青，你叫甚么？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡微微一笑：心想：“乡下姑娘，不懂礼法，只不知她如何学会了这一身出神入化的剑术。只须问到她的师父是谁，再请她师父来教练越士，何愁吴国不破？”想到和西施重逢的时刻指日可期，不由得心口感到一阵热烘烘得暖意，说道：“我叫范蠡，姑娘，请你到我家吃饭去。”阿青道：“我不去，我要赶羊去吃草。”范蠡道：“我家里有大好的草地，你赶羊去吃，我再赔你十头肥羊。”<p/>
<p>   
阿青拍手笑道：“你家里有大草地吗？那好极了。不过我不要你赔羊，我这羊儿又不是你杀的。”她蹲下地来，抚摸被割成了两片的羊身，凄然道：“好老白，乖老白，人家杀死了你，我……我可救你不活了。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡吩咐卫士道：“把老白的两片身子缝了起来，去埋在姑娘屋子的旁边。”<p/>
<p>   
阿青站起身来，面额上有两滴泪珠，眼中却透出喜悦的光芒，说道：“范蠡，你……你不许他们把老白吃了？”范蠡道：“自然不许。那是你的好老白，乖老白，谁都不许吃。”阿青叹了口气，道：“你真好。我最恨人家拿我的羊儿去宰来吃了，不过妈说，羊儿不卖给人家，我们就没钱买米。”范蠡道：“打从今儿起，我时时叫人送米送布给你妈，你养的羊儿，一只也不用卖。”阿青大喜，一把抱住范蠡，叫道：“你真是个好人。”<p/>
<p>   
众卫士见她天真烂漫，既直呼范蠡之名，又当街抱住了他，无不好笑，都转过了头，不敢笑出声来。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡挽住了她的手，似乎生怕这是个天上下凡的仙女，一转身便不见了，在十几头山羊的咩咩声中，和她并肩缓步，同回府中。<p/>
<p>   
阿青赶着羊走进范蠡的大夫第，惊道：“你这屋子真大，一个人住得了吗？”范蠡微微一笑，说道：“我正嫌屋子太大，回头请你妈和你一起来住好不好？你家里还有什么人？”阿青道：“就是我妈和我两个人，不知道我妈肯不肯来。我妈叫我别跟男人多说话。不过你是好人，不会害我们的。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡要阿青将羊群赶入花园之中，命婢仆取出糕饼点心，在花园的凉亭中殷勤款待。众仆役见羊群将花园中的牡丹、芍药、玫瑰种种名花异卉大口咬嚼，而范蠡却笑吟吟的瞧着，无不骇异。<p/>
<p>   
阿青喝茶吃饼，很是高兴。范蠡跟她闲谈半天，觉她言语幼稚，于世务全然不懂，终于问道：“阿青姑娘，教你剑术的那位师父是谁？”<p/>
<p>   
阿青睁着一双明澈的大眼，道：“什么剑术？我没有师父啊。”范蠡道：“你用一根竹棒戳瞎了八个坏人的眼睛，这本事就是剑术了，那是谁教你的？”阿青摇头道：“没有人教我，我自己会的。”范蠡见她神情坦率，实无丝毫作伪之态，心下暗异：“难道当真是天降异人？”说道：“你从小就玩这竹棒？”<p/>
<p>   
阿青道：“本来是不会的，我十三岁那年，白公公来骑羊玩儿，我不许他骑，用竹棒来打我，我就和他对打。起初他总是打到我，我打不着他。我们天天这样打着玩，近来我总是打到他，戳得他很痛，他可戳我不到。他也不大来跟我玩了。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡又惊又喜，道：“白公公住在哪里？你带我去找他好不好？”阿青道：“他住在山里，找他不到的。只有他来找我，我从来没去找过他。”范蠡道：“我想见见他，有没有法子？”阿青沉吟道：“嗯，你跟我一起去牧羊，咱们到山边等他。就是不知道他什么时候会来。”叹了口气道：“进来好久没见到他啦！”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡心想：“为了越国和夷光，跟她去牧羊却又怎地？”便道：“好啊，我就陪你去牧羊，等那位白公公。”寻思：“这阿青姑娘的剑术，自然是那位山中老人白公公所教的了。料想白公公见她年幼天真，便装作用竹棒跟她闹着玩。他能令一个乡下姑娘学到如此神妙的剑术，请他去教练越国吴士，破吴必矣！”<p/>
<p>   
请阿青在府中吃了饭后，便跟随她同到郊外的山里去牧羊。他手下部属不明其理，均感骇怪。一连数日，范蠡手持竹棒，和阿青在山野间牧羊唱歌，等候白公公到来。<p/>
<p>   
第五日上，文种来到范府拜访，见范府掾吏面有忧色，问道：“范大夫多日不见，大王颇为挂念，命我前来探望，莫非范大夫身子不适么？”那掾吏道：“回禀文大夫：范大夫身子并无不适，只是……只是……”文种道：“只是怎样？”那掾吏道：“文大夫是范大夫的好友，我们下吏不敢说的话，文大夫不妨去劝劝他。”文种更是奇怪，问道：“范大夫有什么事？”那掾吏道：“范大夫迷上了那个……那个会使竹棒的乡下姑娘，每天一早便陪着她去牧羊，不许卫士们跟随保护，直到天黑才会来。小吏有公务请示，也不敢前去打扰。”<p/>
<p>   
文种哈哈大笑，心想：“范贤弟在楚国之时，楚人都叫他范疯子。他行事与众不同，原非俗人所能明白。”<p/>
<p>   
这时范蠡正坐在山坡草地上，讲述楚国湘妃和山鬼的故事。阿青坐在他身畔凝神倾听，一双明亮的眼睛，目不转瞬的瞧着他，忽然问道：“那湘妃真是这样好看么？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡轻轻说道：“她的眼睛比这溪水还要明亮，还要清澈……”阿青道：“她眼睛里有鱼游么？”范蠡道：“她的皮肤比天上的白云还要柔和，还要温软……”阿青道：“难道也有小鸟在云里飞吗？”范蠡道：“她的嘴唇比这朵小红花的花瓣还要娇嫩，还要鲜艳，她的嘴唇湿湿的，比这花瓣上的露水还要晶莹。湘妃站在水边，倒影映在清澈的湘江里，江边的鲜花羞惭的都枯萎了，鱼儿不敢在江里游，生怕弄乱了她美丽的倒影。她白雪一般的手伸到湘江里，柔和得好像要溶在水里一样……”<p/>
<p>   
阿青道：“范蠡，你见过她的是不是？为甚么说得这样仔细？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡轻轻叹了口气，说道：“我见过她的，我瞧得非常非常仔细。”<p/>
<p> 
他说的是西施，不是湘妃。<p/>
<p>   
他抬头向着北方，眼光飘过了一条波浪滔滔的大江，这美丽的女郎是在姑苏城中吴王宫里，她这时候在做什么？是在陪伴吴王么？是在想着我么？<p/>
<p>   
阿青道：“范蠡，你的胡子中有两根是白色的，真有趣，像是我羊儿的毛一样。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡想：分手的那天，她伏在我肩上哭泣，泪水湿透了我半边衣衫，这件衫子我永远不洗，她的泪痕之中，又加上了我的眼泪。<p/>
<p>   
阿青说：“范蠡，我想拔你一根胡子来玩，好不好？我轻轻的拔，不会弄痛你的。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡想：她说最爱坐了船在江里湖里慢慢的顺水漂流，等我将她夺回来之后，我大夫也不做了，便是整天和她坐了船，在江里湖里漂流，这么漂游一辈子。<p/>
<p>   
突然之间，颏下微微一痛，阿青已拔下了他一根胡子，只听得她在咯咯娇笑，蓦地里笑声中断，听得她喝道：“你又来了！”<p/>
<p>   
绿影闪动，阿青已激射而出，只见一团绿影、一团白影已迅捷无伦的缠斗在一起。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡大喜：“白公公到了！”眼见两人斗得一会，身法渐渐欢乐下来，他忍不住“啊”的一声叫了出来。<p/>
<p>   
和阿青相斗的竟然不是人，而是一头白猿。<p/>
<p>   
这白猿也拿着一根竹棒，和阿青手中竹棒纵横挥舞的对打。这白猿出棒招数巧妙，劲道凌厉，竹棒刺出时带着呼呼风声，但每一棒刺来，总是给阿青拆解开去，随即以巧妙之极的招数还击过去。<p/>
<p>   
数日前阿青与吴国剑士在长街相斗，一棒便戳瞎一名吴国剑士的眼睛，每次出棒都一式一样，直到此刻，范蠡方见到阿青剑术之精。他于剑术虽然所学不多，但常去临观越国剑士练剑，剑法优劣一眼便能分别。当日吴越剑士相斗，他已看得挤舌不下，此时见到阿青和白猿斗剑，手中所持虽然均是竹棒，但招法之精奇，吴越剑士相形之下，直如儿戏一般。<p/>
<p>   
白猿的竹棒越使越快，阿青却时时凝立不动，偶尔一棒刺出，便如电光急闪，逼得白猿接连倒退。<p/>
<p>   
阿青将白猿逼退三步，随即收棒而立。那白猿双手持棒，身子飞起，挟着一股劲风，向阿青急刺过来。范蠡见到这般猛恶的情势，不由得大惊，叫道：“小心！”却见阿青横棒挥出，拍拍两声轻响，白猿的竹棒已掉在地下。<p/>
<p>   
白猿一声长啸，跃上树梢，接连几个纵跃，已窜出数十丈外，但听得啸声凄厉，渐渐远去，山谷间猿啸回声，良久不绝。<p/>
<p>   
阿青回过身来，叹了口气，道：“白公公断了两条手臂，再也不肯来跟我玩了。”范蠡道：“你打断了它两条手臂？”阿青点头道：“今天白公公凶得很，一连三次，要扑过来刺死你。”范蠡惊道：“它……它要刺死我？为什么？”阿青摇了摇头，道：“我不知道。”范蠡暗暗心惊：“若不是阿青挡住了它，这白猿要刺死我当真是不费吹灰之力。”<p/>
<p>   
第二天早晨，在越王的剑室之中，阿青手持一根竹棒，面对着越国二十名第一流剑手。范蠡知道阿青不会教人如何使剑，只有让越国剑士模仿她的剑法。<p/>
<p>   
但没一个越国剑士能当到她的三招。<p/>
<p> 
阿清竹棒一动，对手若不是手腕被戳，长剑脱手，便是要害中棒，委顿在地。<p/>
<p>   
第二天，三十名剑士败在她的棒下。第三天，又是三十名剑士在她一根短竹棒下腕折臂断，狼狈败退。<p/>
<p>   
到第四天上，范蠡再要找她去会斗越国剑士时，阿青已失了踪影，寻到她的家里，只余下一间空屋，十几头山羊。范蠡派遣数百名部署在会稽城内城外，荒山野岭中去找寻，在也觅不到这个小姑娘的踪迹。<p/>
<p>   
八十名越国剑士没学到阿青的一招剑法，但他们已亲眼见到了神剑的影子。每个人都知道了，世间确有这样神奇的剑法。八十个人将一丝一忽勉强捉摸到的剑法影子传授给了旁人，单是这一丝一忽的神剑影子，越国吴士的剑法便已无敌于天下。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡命薛烛督率良工，铸成了千千万万口利剑。<p/>
<p>   
三年之后，勾践兴兵伐吴，战于五湖之畔。越军五千人持长剑面前，吴兵逆击。两军交锋，越兵长剑闪烁，吴兵当者披靡，吴师大败。<p/>
<p>   
吴王夫差退到余杭山。越兵追击，二次大战，吴病始终挡不住越兵的快剑。夫差兵败自杀。越军攻入吴国的都城姑苏。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡亲领长剑手一千，直冲到吴王的馆娃宫。那是西施所住的地方。他带了几名卫士，奔进宫去，叫道：“夷光，夷光！”<p/>
<p>   
他奔过一道长廊，脚步成发出清朗的回声，长廊下面是空的。西施脚步轻盈，每一步都像是弹琴鼓瑟那样，有美妙的音乐节拍。夫差建了这道长廊，好听她奏着音乐般的脚步声。<p/>
<p>   
在长廊彼端，音乐般的脚步声响了起来，像欢乐的锦瑟，像清和的瑶琴，一个轻柔的声音在说：“少伯，真的是你么？”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡胸口热血上涌，说道：“是我，是我！我来接你了。”他听得自己的声音嘶嘎，好像是别人在说话，好像是很远很远的声音。他踉踉跄跄的奔过去。<p/>
<p>   
长廊上乐声繁音促节，一个柔软的身子扑入了他怀里。<p/>
<p>   
春夜溶溶。花香从园中透过帘子，飘进馆娃宫。范蠡和西施在倾诉着别来得相思。<p/>
<p> 
忽然间寂静之中传来了几声咩咩的羊叫。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡微笑道：“你还是忘不了故乡的风光，在宫室之中也养了山羊吗？”<p/>
<p>   
西施笑着摇了摇头，她有些奇怪，怎么会有羊叫？然而在心爱之人的面前，除了温柔的爱念，任何其他的念头都不会在心中停留长久。她慢慢伸手出去，握住了范蠡的左手。炽热的血同时在两人脉管中迅速流动。<p/>
<p>   
突然间，一个女子声音在静夜中响起：“范蠡！你叫你的西施出来，我要杀了她！”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡陡地站起身来。西施感到他的手掌忽然间变得冰冷。范蠡认得这是阿青的声音。她的呼声越过馆娃宫的高墙，飘了进来。<p/>
<p>   
“范蠡，范蠡，我要杀你的西施，她逃不了的。我一定要杀你的西施。”<p/>
<p>   
范蠡又是惊恐，又是迷惑：“她为甚么要杀夷光？夷光可从来没得罪过她！”蓦地立心中一亮，霎时之间都明白了：“她并不真是个不懂事的乡下姑娘，她一直在喜欢我。”<p/>
<p>   
迷惘已去，惊恐更甚。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡一生临大事，决大疑，不知经历过多少风险，当年在会稽山被吴军围困，粮尽援绝之时，也不及此刻的惧怕。西施感到他手掌中湿腻腻的都是冷汗，觉到他的手掌在发抖。<p/>
<p>   
如果阿青要杀的是他自己，范蠡不会害怕的，然而她要杀的是西施。<p/>
<p> 
“范蠡，范蠡！我要杀了你的西施，她逃不了的！”<p/>
<p>   
阿青的声音忽东忽西，在宫墙外传进来。<p/>
<p> 
范蠡定了定神，说道：“我要去见见这人。”轻轻放脱了西施的手，快步向宫门走去。<p/>
<p>   
十八名卫士跟随在他身后。阿青的呼声人人都听见了，耳听得她在宫外直呼破吴英雄范大夫之名，大家都感到十分诧异。<p/>
<p>   
范蠡走到宫门之外，月光铺地，一眼望去，不见有人，朗声说道：“阿青姑娘，请你过来，我有话说。”四下里寂静无声。范蠡又道：“阿青姑娘，多时不见，你可好么？”可是仍然不闻回答。范蠡等了良久，始终不见阿青现身。<p/>
<p>   
他低声吩咐卫士，立即调来一千名甲士、一千名剑士，在馆娃宫前后守卫。<p/>
<p>   
他回到西施面前，坐了下来，握住她的双手，一句话也不说。从宫外回到西施身畔，他心中已转过了无数念头：“令一个宫女假装夷光，让阿青杀了她？我和夷光化装成为越国甲士，逃出吴宫，从此隐姓埋名？阿青来时，我在她面前自杀，求她饶了夷光？调二千名弓箭手守住宫门，阿青若是硬闯，那便万剑齐发，射死了她？”但每一个计策都有破绽。阿青于越国有大功，也不忍将她杀死，他怔怔的瞧着西施，心头忽然感到一阵温暖：“我二人就这样一起死了，那也好得很。我二人在临死之前，终于是聚在一起了。”<p/>
<p>   
时光缓缓流过。西施觉到范蠡的手掌温暖了。他不再害怕，脸上露出了笑容。<p/>
<p> 
破晓的日光从窗中照射进来。<p/>
<p>   
蓦地里宫门外响起了一阵吆喝声，跟着呛啷郎、呛啷朗响声不绝，那是兵刃落地之声。这声音从宫门外直响进来，便如一条极长的长蛇，飞快的游来，长廊上也响起了兵刃落地的声音。一千名甲士和一千名剑士阻挡不了阿青。<p/>
<p>   
只听得阿青叫道：“范蠡，你在哪里？”<p/>
<p> 
范蠡向西施瞧了一眼，朗声道：“阿青，我在这里。”<p/>
<p>   
“里”字的声音甫绝，嗤的一声响，门帷从中裂开，一个绿衫人飞了进来，正是阿青。她右手竹棒的尖端指住了西施的心口。<p/>
<p>   
她凝视着西施的容光，阿青脸上的杀气渐渐消失，变成了失望和沮丧，再变成了惊奇、羡慕，变成了崇敬，喃喃的说：“天……天下竟有着……这样的美女！范蠡，她……她比你说的还……还要美！”纤腰扭处，一声清啸，已然破窗而出。<p/>
<p>   
清啸迅捷之极的远去，渐远渐轻，余音袅袅，良久不绝。<p/>
<p>   
数十名卫士疾步奔到门外。卫士长躬身道：“大夫无恙？”范蠡摆了摆手，众卫士退了下去。范蠡握着西施的手，道：“咱们换上庶民的衣衫，我和你到太湖划船去，再也不回来了。”<p/>
<p>   
西施眼中闪出无比快乐的光芒，忽然之间，微微蹙起了眉头，伸手捧着心口。阿青这一棒虽然没戳中她，但棒端发出的劲气已刺伤了她心口。<p/>
<p>   
两千年来人们都知道，“西子捧心”是人间最美丽的形象。[完]
