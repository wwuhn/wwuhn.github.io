  <div class="left">IT WAS ONE of those rare December days when the sun was almost as warm as Indian summer. Dry red leaves still clung to the oak in Aunt Pitty’s yard and a faint yellow green still persisted in the dying grass. Scarlett, with the baby in her arms, stepped out onto the side porch and sat down in a rocking chair in a patch of sunshine. She was wearing a new green challis dress trimmed with yards and yards of black rickrack braid and a new lace house cap which Aunt Pitty had made for her. Both were very becoming to her and she knew it and took great pleasure in them. How good it was to look pretty again after the long months of looking so dreadful!</div>
  <div class="right">１２月里，难得有这么一天，太阳暖烘烘的，差不多和小阳春时节一样，皮蒂姑妈院里的橡树上仍然挂着干了的红叶子，渐渐枯萎的小草还能看出一丝黄绿色，思嘉抱着孩子来到侧面的回廓上，在一片有阳光照耀的地方坐在了摇椅子。她身装一件崭新的绿色薄长裙，裙上镶着许多波浪式的黑色花边，头戴一顶新的网眼便帽。这都是皮蒂姑妈给她做的。这两件东西都对她很合适，她也知道，因此心里十分高兴，几个月以来一直那么难看，现在又漂亮起来了，多开心呀！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As she sat rocking the baby and humming to herself, she heard the sound of hooves coming up the side street and, peering curiously through the tangle of dead vines on the porch, she saw Rhett Butler riding toward the house.
<p>He had been away from Atlanta for months, since just after Gerald died, since long before Ella Lorena was born. She had missed him but she now wished ardently that there was some way to avoid seeing him. In fact, the sight of his dark face brought a feeling of guilty panic to her breast. A matter in which Ashley was concerned lay on her conscience and she did not wish to discuss it with Rhett, but she knew he would force the discussion, no matter how disinclined she might be.</p>He drew up at the gate and swung lightly to the ground and she thought, staring nervously at him, that he looked just like an illustration in a book Wade was always pestering her to read aloud.
</div>
  <div class="right">她坐在摇椅上，一面摇着孩子，一面哼着小曲儿，忽然听见后街上传来马蹄声，她从过道上杂乱的枯藤缝里好奇地向外探望，只见瑞德.巴特勒正骑着马朝她家走来。<p>他离开亚特兰大有好几个月了。他走的时候，杰拉尔德刚去世，爱拉.洛雷纳还差很长时间没有出生。思嘉曾经想念过他，但是此刻她真想找个什么法子躲开，不见他。实际上，她一看见他那黑脸膛，心里就因内疚而感到慌乱。有件事涉及艾希礼，一直使她心里不安，而她不愿意与瑞德讨论这件事，但是她知道，不论她多么不想讨论，瑞德是一定要讨论的。</p>他在大门外停下来，翻身轻轻地下了马，思嘉一边紧张注视着他。一边想，发现他很像韦德常常央求好读给他听的一本书里画的插图。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“All he needs is earrings and a cutlass between his teeth,” she thought. “Well, pirate or no, he’s not going to cut my throat today if I can help it.”
<p>As he came up the walk she called a greeting to him, summoning her sweetest smile. How lucky that she had on her new dress and the becoming cap and looked so pretty! As his eyes went swiftly over her, she knew he thought her pretty, too.</p>“A new baby! Why, Scarlett, this is a surprise!” he laughed, leaning down to push the blanket away from Ella Lorena’s small ugly face.
<p>“Don’t be silly,” she said, blushing. “How are you, Rhett? You’ve been away a long time.”</p>“So I have. Let me hold the baby, Scarlett. Oh, I know how to hold babies. I have many strange accomplishments. Well, he certainly looks like Frank. All except the whiskers, but give him time.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“他就缺少一副耳环和衔在嘴里的短刀了，"思嘉想。"唉，管他是不是海盗，只要我有办法，今天无论如何也不能让他把我给杀了。"<p>他顺着小路走过来，思嘉跟他打个招呼，同时装出一副最甜密的笑脸。她正好穿着一件新衣服，戴着一顶适合于她的帽子，显得那么漂亮，真是幸运啊！他迅速地打量了她一番，立刻思嘉知道，他也认为她是很漂亮的。</p>“刚生的孩子！哎呀，思嘉，可真没想到哇！"他一边说，一边笑了，同时弯腰掀开毯子，看了看爱拉.洛雷纳难看的小脸。<p>“看你说的，"思嘉说着，脸都红了。"瑞德，你好吗？你走了很长时间了呢。"</p>“的确是这样。思嘉，让我抱抱孩子吧。唔，我懂得怎么抱孩子，我有许多奇怪的才干。他可真像弗兰克，就是没有胡子，不过到时候会长的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I hope not. It’s a girl.”
<p>“A girl? That’s better still. Boys are such nuisances. Don’t ever have any more boys, Scarlett.”</p>It was on the tip of her tongue to reply tartly that she never intended to have any more babies, boys or girls, but she caught herself in time and smiled, casting about quickly in her mind for some topic of conversation that would put off the bad moment when the subject she feared would come up for discussion.
<p>“Did you have a nice trip, Rhett? Where did you go this time?”</p>“Oh—Cuba—New Orleans—other places. Here, Scarlett, take the baby. She’s beginning to slobber and I can’t get to my handkerchief. She’s a fine baby, I’m sure, but she’s wetting my shirt bosom.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“还是别长的好。这是个女孩儿。"<p>“是个女孩儿？那就更好了，男孩子都讨人嫌。你可别再生男孩儿了，思嘉。"</p>思嘉本来想回敬他一句，说不管男孩儿女孩儿都不愿再生了，可是话到嘴边，她又咽下去了。她笑了笑，在脑子里到处搜寻合适的话题，以拖延时间，暂时不讨论她怕谈的那个问题。<p>“这次出去，一切都好吗，瑞德？你这次去了哪里？"</p>“唔，到了古巴--新奥尔良----还有一些别的地方。哎呀，思嘉。快把孩子接过去吧，她流哈喇子了，我又没法掏手绢儿。我知道，她是好孩子，不过她把我的前襟弄湿了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She took the child back into her lap and Rhett settled himself lazily on the banister and took a cigar from a silver case.
<p>“You are always going to New Orleans,” she said and pouted a little. “And you never will tell me what you do there.”</p>“I am a hard-working man, Scarlett, and perhaps my business takes me there.”
<p>“Hard-working! You!” she laughed impertinently. “You never worked in your life. You’re too lazy. All you ever do is finance Carpetbaggers in their thieving and take half the profits and bribe Yankee officials to let you in on schemes to rob us taxpayers.” </p>He threw back his head and laughed.
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉把孩子接过来，放在腿上，瑞德懒洋洋地坐在栏杆上，从一个银盒子里取出一根雪茄。<p>“你老去新奥尔良去，"她说，她撅了撅嘴又接着说：“你从来不肯告诉我去那儿干什么呢。"</p>“我这个人工作勤奋呢。思嘉，我大概是为了公事而去的吧。”<p>“你还工作勤奋！”她毫不客平地笑起来。"你一辈子就没工作过。你太懒了。你就会资助北方来的冒险家，让他们偷盗，好处和你对半分，然后你就贿赂北方的官员，让你参加与他们的规划，来掠夺我们这些纳税人。"</p>他把头往后一仰，大笑起来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“And how you would love to have money enough to bribe officials, so you could do likewise!”
<p>“The very idea—” She began to ruffle.</p>“But perhaps you will make enough money to get into bribery on a large scale some day. Maybe you’ll get rich off those convicts you leased.”
<p>“Oh,” she said, a little disconcerted, “how did you find out about my gang so soon?”</p>“I arrived last night and spent the evening in the Girl of the Period Saloon, where one hears all the news of the town. It’s a clearing house for gossip. Better than a ladies’ sewing circle. Everyone told me that you’d leased a gang and put that little plug-ugly, Gallegher, in charge to work them to death.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你是多么想赚够了钱去贿赂官员们，你也好那么干呀！"<p>“你这种想法--"思嘉开始有些恼怒。</p>“也许有朝一日你赚足了钱以后，就大规模行贿。说不定你靠那些雇来的犯人能发大财呢。"<p>“啊！"思嘉说。她有些心烦意乱了。"你怎么这么快就知道我雇用犯人了？"</p>“我昨天晚上就到这里，在时代少女酒馆过的夜，那里消息满天飞，是个闲言碎语大汇合的地方，比妇女缝纫会可强多了。大家都说你雇用了一伙犯人，让那个小恶棍加勒格尔管着他们，要把他们累死。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“That’s a lie,” she said angrily. “He won’t work them to death. I’ll see to that”
<p>“Will you?”</p>“Of course I will! How can you even insinuate such things?”
<p>“Oh, I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Kennedy! I know your motives are always above reproach. However, Johnnie Gallegher is a cold little bully if I ever saw one. Better watch him or you’ll be having trouble when the inspector comes around.”</p>“You tend to your business and I’ll tend to mine,” she said indignantly. “And I don’t want to talk about convicts any more. Everybody’s been hateful about them. My gang is my own business— And you haven’t told me yet what you do in New Orleans. You go there so often that everybody says—” She paused. She had not intended to say so much.
</div>
  <div class="right">“这不是真的。"她忿怒地说。“他不会把他们累死的。我可以保证。"<p>“你能保证吗？"</p>“我当然能保证，你怎么会提出这样的问题？"<p>“唔，请原谅，肯尼迪太太！我知道你的动机一向是无可非议的。然而约翰尼.加勒格尔是个冷酷的小无赖。我没见过第二个人像他那样的人。最好盯着他点，要不检查员一来，你就麻烦了。"</p>“你走你的阳关道。我过我的独木桥，”思嘉生气地说。“犯人的事，我不想多说了。人们都说不赞成，可雇用犯人是我自己的事--你还没告诉我你在新奥尔良干什么呢？你老往那里跑，大家都说--"说到这里，她住了口，她本来不想提这件事。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“What do they say?”
<p>“Well—that you have a sweetheart there. That you are going to get married. Are you, Rhett?”</p>She had been curious about this for so long that she could not refrain from asking the point-blank question. A queer little pang of jealousy jabbed at her at the thought of Rhett getting married, although why that should be she did not know.
<p>His bland eyes grew suddenly alert and he caught her gaze and held it until a little blush crept up into her cheeks.</p>“Would it matter much to you?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“大家都说什么？”<p>“说--说你在那里有个情人。说你要结婚了。是吗，瑞德？"</p>她很久以来就想知道到底有没有这回事，所以现在她按捺不住，就坦率地提出了这个问题，她一想到瑞德要结婚，就有一种莫名其妙的妒忌心理使她感到隐隐痛苦。至于为什么这样，她自己也说不清楚。<p>他平静的眼神顿时机警起来，他迎着思嘉的视线，盯着她看，看得她两颊泛起了红晕。</p>“这对你有很大关系吗？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, I should hate to lose your friendship,” she said primly and, with an attempt at disinterestedness, bent down to pull the blanket closer about Ella Lorena’s head.
<p>He laughed suddenly, shortly, and said: “Look at me, Scarlett.”</p>She looked up unwillingly, her blush deepening.
<p>“You can tell your curious friends that when I marry it will be because I couldn’t get the woman I wanted in any other way. And I’ve never yet wanted a woman bad enough to marry her.”</p>Now she was indeed confused and embarrassed, for she remembered the night on this very porch during the siege when he had said: “I am not a marrying man” and casually suggested that she become his mistress—remembered, too, the terrible day when he was in jail and was shamed by the memory. A slow malicious smile went over his face as he read her eyes.
</div>
  <div class="right">“怎么说呢，我不想失去你的友情啊，"思嘉一本正经地说。为了显得对这件事并不十分在意，她还低下头拉了拉毯子，把孩子的头围了围。<p>他突然大笑一声，接着说。"思嘉你看着我。"</p>她勉强抬起头来，脸更红了。<p>“你那些朋友要是问起来，你就说要是我结婚，那是因为我没有别的办法把那个女人弄到手。到现在为止，我还没有发现一个女人我非要娶她不可呢。"</p>这样一来，她倒真的弄不明白了，而且感到难堪。因为她想起围城期间，有一天晚上，也是在这个回廊上，他说：我这个男人是不打算结婚的，而且流露出要她做情妇的意思。她还想起那天到监狱去看他的可怕情景，想到这里她又感到一阵羞愧。瑞德注视着她的眼神，脸上渐渐露出了一副讥笑。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“But I will satisfy your vulgar curiosity since you ask such pointed questions. It isn’t a sweetheart that takes me to New Orleans. It’s a child, a little boy.”
<p>“A little boy!” The shock of this unexpected information wiped out her confusion.</p>“Yes, he is my legal ward and I am responsible for him. He’s in school in New Orleans. I go there frequently to see him.”
<p>“And take him presents?” So, she thought, that’s how he always knows what kind of presents Wade likes!</p>“Yes,” he said shortly, unwillingly.
</div>
  <div class="right">“不过你既然坦率问我，我还是满足你这无聊的好奇心吧。我到新奥尔良去，不是为了什么情人，而是为一个孩子，一个小男孩儿。"<p>“一个小男孩儿！"这突如起来的消息使她十分惊讶，她倒明白了。</p>“是的，我是他的监护人，要对他负责。他在新奥尔良上学。我常常那里去，主是去看他的。"<p>“给他带礼物吗？"她问。这时她明白了为什么他总知道韦德喜欢什么礼物。</p>“是的，"他有些不耐烦，简短回答说。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, I never! Is he handsome?”
<p>“Too handsome for his own good.”</p>“Is he a nice little boy?”
<p>“No. He’s a perfect hellion. I wish he had never been born. Boys are troublesome creatures. Is there anything else you’d like to know?”
</p>He looked suddenly angry and his brow was dark, as though he already regretted speaking of the matter at all.
</div>
  <div class="right">“我可从来不给，他长得好看吗？”<p>“太好看了，不过这对他并没有好处。"</p>“他乖吗？"<p>“不乖，可调皮了，我真希望从来就没这么个孩子，男孩子都讨人赚。你还有什么要问的吗？"</p>他突然脸色不快，象生气似的似乎后悔不该提起这件事。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, not if you don’t want to tell me any more,” she said loftily, though she was burning for further information. “But I just can’t see you in the role of a guardian,” and she laughed, hoping to disconcert him.
<p>“No, I don’t suppose you can. Your vision is pretty limited.”</p>He said no more and smoked his cigar in silence for a while. She cast about for some remark as rude as his but could think of none.
<p>“I would appreciate it if you’d say nothing of this to anyone,” he said finally. “Though I suppose that asking a woman to keep her mouth shut is asking the impossible.”</p>“I can keep a secret,” she said with injured dignity.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你要是不想说，我当然就不问了，"她傲慢地说，其实她是很想再了解一些情况的。”不过我实在看不出你可以当监护人。"说完了，大笑起来，想借此来刺他一下。<p>“你自然看不出，你的视野是很有限的嘛。"</p>他没有说下去，抽着烟沉默了一会儿，思嘉很想找一句无礼的话来回敬他，可是怎么也想不出来。<p>“这件事你要是不跟别人说，我就非常感激你了，"他最后说，"不过我知道要求一个女人保守秘密是不可能的。"</p>“我是能保守秘密的，"她说，觉得自尊心受到了伤害。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Can you? It’s nice to learn unsuspected things about friends. Now, stop pouting, Scarlett. I’m sorry I was rude but you deserved it for prying. Give me a smile and let’s be pleasant for a minute or two before I take up an unpleasant subject.”
<p>Oh, dear! she thought. Now, he’s going to talk about Ashley and the mill! and she hastened to smile and show her dimple to divert him. “Where else did you go, Rhett? You haven’t been in New Orleans all this time, have you?”</p>“No, for the last month I’ve been in Charleston. My father died.”
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.”</p>“Don’t be. I’m sure he wasn’t sorry to die, and I’m sure I’m not sorry he’s dead.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你能吗？了解到朋友的真实情况当然是很好的。思嘉，别撅着嘴了。很抱歉，我刚才失礼了，不过你非要盘根问底，也只好怪你自己了。对我笑一笑，我们愉快地待一会儿吧，下面我就要提出一个令人不快的话题了。"<p>“哎呀！"她心想，“现在他肯定要谈艾希礼的木材厂的事了。"于是她很快装出一副笑脸，露出酒窝，想借以讨他的欢心，"瑞德，你还去过什么地方？总不至于一直待在新奥尔良吧，对不对？"</p>“对，最近这一个月，我在查尔斯顿，我父亲去世了。"<p>“唔，真遗憾。"</p>“不必感到遗憾，对于他的死，我敢说，他不遗憾，我也不遗憾。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>“Rhett, what a dreadful thing to say!”</p>“It would be much more dreadful if I pretended to be sorry, when I wasn’t, wouldn’t it? There was never any love lost between us. I cannot remember when the old gentleman did not disapprove of me. I was too much like his own father and he disapproved heartily of his father. And as I grew older his disapproval of me became downright dislike, which, I admit, I did little to change. All the things Father wanted me to do and be were such boring things. And finally he threw me out into the world without a cent and no training whatsoever to be anything but a Charleston gentleman, a good pistol shot and an excellent poker player. And he seemed to take it as a personal affront that I did not starve but put my poker playing to excellent advantage and supported myself royally by gambling. He was so affronted at a Butler becoming a gambler that when I came home for the first time, he forbade my mother to see me. And all during the war when I was blockading out of Charleston, Mother had to lie and slip off to see me. Naturally that didn’t increase my love for him.”
</div>
  <div class="right"><p>“瑞德，你怎么这样说话，太可怕啦！"</p>“我是明明不遗憾，却硬作装遗憾的样子，岂不更可怕吗？我们两个人之间一直没有好感，我想不起老头子在我哪件事情上持过赞成的态度，我太像我爷爷了。而他对我爷爷也总是说不赞成就不赞成。我长大以后，他从不赞成渐渐变成了不折的不扣的厌恶，我承认，我也没有想办法改变他对我的这种态度。父亲要求我做什么事，做什么人，都是非常无聊的。最后他把我赶出家门，我身无分文，也没受过什么教育，只能当一个查尔斯顿男子汉、神枪手和扑克高手。我没有饿死，而是充分发挥了打扑克的本事，靠赌博，日子过得很不错。而我父亲觉得这是对他的莫大侮辱，巴特勒家出了赌徒，他受不了，所以我第一次回家，他就不容许我母亲见我。战争期间，我要查尔顿外面跑封锁线的时候，母亲撒了个谎，才溜出来看了看我，这自然不会增加我对他的好感。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, I didn’t know all that!”
<p>“He was what is pointed out as a fine old gentleman of the old school which means that he was ignorant, thick headed, intolerant and incapable of thinking along any lines except what other gentlemen of the old school thought. Everyone admired him tremendously for having cut me off and counted me as dead. ‘If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out.’ I was his right eye, his oldest son, and he plucked me out with a vengeance.”</p>He smiled a little, his eyes hard with amused memory.
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，这些情况原来我一点不知道。"<p>“我父亲，人们说他是一位正派的老先生，是属于老派的，也就是说，他既无知，又顽固，而且容不得人，和老派的先生们想法一模一样，没有自己的想法，他抛弃我，说我死了，大家都很佩服他。""'你假如你的右眼使你犯罪，把它挖出来，'我就是他的右眼，他的长子，他为了报复，就把我挖掉了。"</p>说到这里，他面露微笑，由于回忆这段有趣的往事，他两眼一动不动。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, I could forgive all that but I can’t forgive what he’s done to Mother and my sister since the war ended. They’ve been practically destitute. The plantation house was burned and the rice fields have gone back to marsh lands. And the town house went for taxes and they’ve been living in two rooms that aren’t fit for darkies. I’ve sent money to Mother, but Father has sent it back—tainted money, you see!—and several times I’ve gone to Charleston and given money, on the sly, to my sister. But Father always found out and raised merry hell with her, till her life wasn’t worth living, poor girl. And back the money came to me. I don’t know how they’ve lived. ... Yes, I do know. My brother’s given what he could, though he hasn’t much to give and he won’t take anything from me either—speculator’s money is unlucky money, you see! And the charity of their friends. Your Aunt Eulalie, she’s been very kind. She’s one of Mother’s best friends, you know. She’s given them clothes and— Good God! My mother on charity!”</div>
  <div class="right">“唉，这一切我都可以原谅，但是一想到战后他是怎样对待我母亲和我妹妹的，我就不能宽恕他。她们生活没有来源。农场的房子烧掉了，稻田又变成了沼泽地。因为纳不起税，镇上的房子也完了。她们住着连黑人都不住的两间房子。我给母亲寄钱去，可父亲又把钱退回来--这钱不干净啊，你明白吗？--好几次我回到查尔斯顿，偷偷把钱塞给我妹妹。可是父亲总能发现，对她大发脾气，闹得她活不下去，真可怜啊！钱还是退回来了，我不知道她们是怎么。……我也不是不知道。我弟弟尽力帮助，但又没有多少钱来，他也是不肯接受我的帮助--用投机商的钱会倒梅，你明白吗？另外就是靠朋友接济。你姨妈尤拉莉一直对她们很好。你知道，她是和我母亲最要好。她送给她们衣服，还有--我的天啊！我母亲到了靠人济的地步！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was one of the few times she had ever seen him with his mask off, his face hard with honest hatred for his father and distress for his mother.
<p>“Aunt ‘Lalie! But, good Heavens, Rhett, she hasn’t got anything much above what I send her!”</p>“Ah, so that’s where it comes from! How ill bred of you, my dear, to brag of such a thing in the face of my humiliation. You must let me reimburse you!”
<p>“With pleasure,” said Scarlett, her mouth suddenly twisting into a grin, and he smiled back.</p>“Ah, Scarlett, how the thought of a dollar does make your eyes sparkle! Are you sure you haven’t some Scotch or perhaps Jewish blood as well as Irish?”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉很少见他这样摘去面具，他脸上露出了对父亲的痛恨，和对母亲的怜恤。<p>“尤拉莉姨吗？真是天知道，瑞德，除了我给她的钱以外，她还有什么呢？”</p>“噢，原来她的钱是从你这里来的！你可真没教养了。我的宝贝儿，居然当着我的面吹嘘这件事来寒碜我。我非把钱还给你不可！"<p>“那太好了，"思嘉说。她突然一咧嘴笑了，瑞德也朝她咧嘴笑了。</p>“唔，思嘉，怎么一提到钱，你就眉开眼笑？你能肯定除了爱尔兰血统以外，你身上没有一点苏格兰血统吗？说不定还有犹太血统呢！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Don’t be hateful! I didn’t mean to throw it in your face about Aunt ‘Lalie. But honestly, she thinks I’m made of money. She’s always writing me for more and, God knows, I’ve got enough on my hands without supporting all of Charleston. What did your father die of?”
<p>“Genteel starvation, I think—and hope. It served him right. He was willing to let Mother and Rosemary starve with him. Now that he’s dead, I can help them. I’ve bought them a house on the Battery and they’ve servants to look after them. But of course, they couldn’t let it be known that the money came from me.”</p>“Why not?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“真讨厌！我刚才并不是有意说起尤拉莉姨妈，让你感到难为情。但是说实话，她认为我浑身是钱，所以总写信来要钱。天晓得，就算不接济查尔斯顿那边，我的开销也已经够多了，你父亲是怎么死的？"<p>“慢慢饿死的，我想是这样--我也希望是这样，他罪有应得。他是想让母亲和罗斯玛丽和他一起饿死的。现在他死了，我就可以帮助她们了。我在炮台山给她们买了一栋房子，还有佣人伺候她们，当然她们不愿说钱是我给的。"</p>“那是为什么？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“My dear, surely you know Charleston! You’ve visited there. My family may be poor but they have a position to uphold. And they couldn’t uphold it if it were known that gambling money and speculator’s money and Carpetbag money was behind it. No, they gave it out that Father left an enormous life insurance—that he’d beggared himself and starved himself to death to keep up the payments, so that after he died, they’d be provided for. So he is looked upon as an even greater gentleman of the old school than before. ... In fact, a martyr to his family. I hope he’s turning in his grave at the knowledge that Mother and Rosemary are comfortable now, in spite of his efforts. ... In a way, I’m sorry he’s dead because he wanted to die— was so glad to die.”</div>
  <div class="right">“亲爱的，你还不了解查尔顿吗？你到那里去过，我家虽然穷，也得维持它的社会地位，要是让人家知道这是用了赌徒的钱，投机商的钱，北方来的冒险家的钱，这地位就无法维持了，她们对外是这么说的：父亲留下了一大笔人寿保险金--他生前为了按期付款，节衣缩食以至于饿死，就是为了他死后他们生活有保证，这样一来，他这个老派先生的名声可就更大了。……实际上，他成了为家殉难的人。他要是在九泉之下知道母亲和罗斯玛瓦都过上了好日子，他的劲儿都白费了，因而不能瞑目，那就好了。……他是想死的--是很愿意去死的，所以我对他的死，可以说不感到遗憾。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why?”
<p>“Oh, he really died when Lee surrendered. You know the type. He never could adjust himself to the new times and spent his time talking about the good old days.”</p>“Rhett, are all old folks like that?” She was thinking of Gerald and what Will had said about him.
</div>
  <div class="right">“为什么？"<p>“唔，事实上他是李将军投降的时候就死了。你知道他那种人。永远也不可能适应新的时代，没完没了地唠叨过去的好日子。"</p>“瑞德，老年人都是这样吗？"她想到父亲杰拉尔德以及威尔说的关于他的情况。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Heavens, no! Just look at your Uncle Henry and that old wild cat, Mr. Merriwether, just to name two. They took a new lease on life when they marched out with the Home Guard and it seems to me that they’ve gotten younger and more peppery ever since. I met old man Merriwether this morning driving René’s pie wagon and cursing the horse like an army mule skinner. He told me he felt ten years younger since he escaped from the house and his daughter-in-law’s coddling and took to driving the wagon. And your Uncle Henry enjoys fighting the Yankees in court and out and defending the widow and the orphan—free of charge, I fear—against the Carpetbaggers. If there hadn’t been a war, he’d have retired long ago and nursed his rheumatism. They’re young again because they are of use again and feel that they are needed. And they like this new day that gives old men another chance. But there are plenty of people, young people, who feel like my father and your father. They can’t and won’t adjust and that brings me to the unpleasant subject I want to discuss with you, Scarlett.”</div>
  <div class="right">“天啊，不是的。你就看享利叔叔和那老猫梅里韦瑟先生，就以他们二人为例吧。他们随乡团出征的时候，就开始了一种新生活。依我看，从那以后他们显得更年轻了，更有活力了。我今天早上还遇到梅里韦瑟老人，他赶着雷内的馅饼车，和军队里赶车的一样，一边走，一边骂牲口。他对我说，自从他走出家门，避开媳妇的照顾，开始赶车以来，他感到年轻了十岁。还有你那享利叔叔，他在法庭内外和北方佬斗，保护寡妇和孤儿，对付北方来的冒险家，干得可起劲了--我估计他是不要钱的。要不是爆发了战争，他早就退休，去治他的关节炎去了，他们又年轻了，这是因为他们又有用了，而且发现人们需要他们，新的时代给老年人提供了机会，他们是喜欢这个新时代的。但是许多人，包括许多年轻人与我父亲和你父亲一样，他们既不能适应，也不想适应。既然说到这里，我就要和你讨论一个不愉快的问题了，思嘉。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">His sudden shift so disconcerted her that she stammered: “What—what—” and inwardly groaned: “Oh, Lord! Now, it’s coming. I wonder if I can butter him down?”
<p>“I shouldn’t have expected either truth or honor or fair dealing from you, knowing you as I do. But foolishly, I trusted you.”</p>“I don’t know what you mean.”
<p>“I think you do. At any rate, you look very guilty. As I was riding along Ivy Street a white ago, on my way to call on you, who should hail me from behind a hedge but Mrs. Ashley Wilkes! Of course, I stopped and chatted with her.”</p>“Indeed?”
</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德突然改变了话题，使得思嘉一阵慌乱，所以她结结巴巴地说：“什么--什么--"而在内心里痛苦地说：“老天爷，问题来了。不知能不能把他压祝"<p>“我了解你的为人，所以不指望你说实话，顾面子，公平交易。但是我当时信任你，真是太傻了。"</p>"我不明白你的意思。"<p>“我想你明白的，无论如何，你看上去是心虚的。我刚才来的时候，路过艾维街，有人在篱笆后面跟我打招呼，不是别人，正是艾希礼.威尔克斯太太，我当然停下来，和她聊了一会儿。"</p>“真的吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes, we had an enjoyable talk. She told me she had always wanted to let me know how brave she thought I was to have struck a blow for the Confederacy, even at the eleventh hour.”
<p>“Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! Melly’s a fool. She might have died that night because you acted so heroic.”</p>“I imagine she would have thought her life given in a good cause. And when I asked her what she was doing in Atlanta she looked quite surprised at my ignorance and told me that they were living here now and that you had been kind enough to make Mr. Wilkes a partner in your mill.”
<p>“Well, what of it?” questioned Scarlett, shortly.</p>“When I lent you the money to buy that mill I made one stipulation, to which you agreed, and that was that it should not go to the support of Ashley Wilkes.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“真的。我们谈得非常愉快。她说她一直想告诉我，她认为我在最后时刻还能为了联盟而出击，这是多么勇敢的行为埃"<p>“一派胡言！媚兰是个糊涂虫，由于你的英雄行为，那天晚上她差一点死了。"</p>“如果死了，我想她会认为自己是为了高尚的事业而牺牲的。我问她在亚特兰大干什么，她对我这样不了解情况感到惊讶，她说他们现在搬到这里来住了，还说你待他们很好，让威尔克斯先生与你合伙经营木材厂了。"<p>“那有什么关系？"思嘉简捷地问。</p>“我借钱给你买那家木材厂的时候，曾作过一条规定，你当时也同意了的。那就是不能用这家木材厂来养活艾希礼.威尔克斯。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You are being very offensive. I’ve paid you back your money and I own the mill and what I do with it is my own business.”
<p>“Would you mind telling me how you made the money to pay back my loan?”</p>“I made it selling lumber, of course.”
<p>“You made it with the money I lent you to give you your start. That’s what you mean. My money is being used to support Ashley. You are a woman quite without honor and if you hadn’t repaid my loan, I’d take great pleasure in calling it in now and selling you out at public auction if you couldn’t pay.”</p>He spoke lightly but there was anger flickering in his eyes.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你可真讨厌。你的钱我已经还了，现在这个厂归我所有，我要怎么办，那是我自己的事。"<p>“你能不能告诉我，你还帐的钱是怎么来的？”</p>“当然是卖木材赚的。"<p>“你是利用我借给你创业的钱赚来的。这才应该是你的意思。你利用我的钱来养活艾希礼，你这个女人完全不讲信用，如果你现在还没有还我的钱，我就会来逼债，你要是还不起，我就会把你拍卖，那才有意思呢。"</p>他的话虽然不重，眼里却冒着怒火。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett hastily carried the warfare into the enemy’s territory.
<p>“Why do you hate Ashley so much? I believe you’re jealous of him.”</p>After she had spoken she could have bitten her tongue, for he threw back his head and laughed until she went red with mortification.
<p>“Add conceit to dishonor,” he said. “You’ll never get over being the belle of the County, will you? You’ll always think you’re the cutest little trick in shoe leather and that every man you meet is expiring for love of you.”</p>“I don’t either!” she cried hotly. “But I just can’t see why you hate Ashley so much and that’s the only explanation I can think of.”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉急忙把战火引到敌人的领土上去。<p>“你为什么这么恨艾希礼？我想你准是妒忌他吧。"</p>她话一出口，恨不得把舌头咬掉，因为瑞德仰天大笑，弄得她很难为情，满脸通红。<p>“你不但不讲信用，而且还非常自负，"他说。"你以为你这全区的大美人儿可以没完没了地当下去，是不是？你以为自己总是漂亮的小姑娘，男人见了没有不爱的。"</p>“不对！"她气愤地说。"可我就是不明白你为什么这么恨艾希礼。我能想到的就只有这个理由。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, think something else, pretty charmer, for that’s the wrong explanation. And as for hating Ashley— I don’t hate him any more than I like him. In fact, my only emotion toward him and his kind is pity.”
<p>“Pity?”</p>“Yes, and a little contempt. Now, swell up like a gobbler and tell me that he is worth a thousand blackguards like me and that I shouldn’t dare to be so presumptuous as to feel either pity or contempt for him. And when you have finished swelling, I’ll tell you what I mean, if you’re interested.”
<p>“Well, I’m not.”</p>“I shall tell you, just the same, for I can’t bear for you to go on nursing your pleasant delusion of my jealousy. I pity him because he ought to be dead and he isn’t. And I have a contempt for him because he doesn’t know what to do with himself now that his world is gone.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你再想想，小妖精。这个理由不对。至于我恨艾希礼--我既不喜欢他，也不恨他。事实上，我对他和他这一类的人只感到怜悯。”<p>“怜悯？"</p>“是的，还加一点鄙视。你现在可以像火鸡那样叫唤，你可以告诉我像我这样的流氓，一千个顶不上他一个，怎么竟敢如此狂妄，竟然对他表示怜悯或鄙视呢。等你发完了火，我再向你说明我的意思，如果你有兴趣的话。"<p>"唔，我没有兴趣。"</p>“我还是告诉你吧，因为我不忍心让你继续作你的美梦，以为我妒忌他。我怜悯他，是因为他早就应该死了，而他没有死。我鄙视他，是因他的世界已经完了，而他不知如何是好。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">There was something familiar in the idea he expressed. She had a confused memory of having beard similar words but she could not remember when and where. She did not think very hard about it for her anger was hot.
<p>“If you had your way all the decent men in the South would be dead!”</p>“And if they had their way, I think Ashley’s kind would prefer to be dead. Dead with neat stones above them, saying: ‘Here lies a soldier of the Confederacy, dead for the Southland’ or ‘Dulce et decorum est—‘ or any of the other popular epitaphs.”
<p>“I don’t see why!”</p>“You never see anything that isn’t written in letters a foot high and then shoved under your nose, do you? If they were dead, their troubles would be over, there’d be no problems to face, problems that have no solutions. Moreover, their families would be proud of them through countless generations. And I’ve heard the dead are happy. Do you suppose Ashley Wilkes is happy?”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉感到他这些话有点耳熟。她隐隐约约记得听过类似的话，但想不起来是在什么时候，什么地方听到的了。她正在气头儿上，所以也没有多想。<p>“照你这么说，南方所有正经人就都该死了！"</p>“要是按照他们的想法去做，我想艾希礼之类的人是宁愿死了的。死了就可以在坟上竖一块方方正正的碑，上面写着'联盟战士为南国而战死长眠于此'。或者写着'dulceetdecorumest--'或者写着其它常见的碑文。"<p>“我不明白这是什么意思！"</p>“要是不用一英尺高的字母写出来，放在你鼻子底下，你是什么也看不明白的，对不对？我是说，一了百了，他们死了就不必解决问题了，那些问题也是无法解决的。除此之外，他们的家庭会世世代代为他们而感到骄傲。我听说死人都是很幸福的。你觉得艾希礼.威尔克幸福吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why, of course—” she began and then she remembered the look in Ashley’s eyes recently and stopped.
<p>“Is he happy or Hugh Elsing or Dr. Meade? Any more than my father and your father were happy?”</p>“Well, perhaps not as happy as they might be, because they’ve all lost their money.”
<p>He laughed.</p>“It isn’t losing their money, my pet. I tell you it’s losing their world—the world they were raised in. They’re like fish out of water or cats with wings. They were raised to be certain persons, to do certain things, to occupy certain niches. And those persons and things and niches disappeared forever when General Lee arrived at Appomattox. Oh, Scarlett, don’t look so stupid! What is there for Ashley Wilkes to do, now that his home is gone and his plantation taken up for taxes and fine gentlemen are going twenty for a penny? Can he work with his head or his hands? I’ll bet you’ve lost money hand over fist since he took over that mill.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“那当然--"她没有说下去，因为她想起最近见到艾希礼的眼神。<p>“难道他，还有休.埃尔辛，还有米德大夫，他们都幸福吗？他们比我父亲、比你父亲幸福吗？"</p>“唉。也许他们没有感到幸福。因为他们都失去了自己的钱财。"<p>他笑了。</p>“不是因为失去了钱财，我的宝贝儿。我告诉你吧，是因为失去了他们的世界--他们从小就生活在里面的那个世界。他们如今好像鱼离开了水，猫长了翅儿。他们受的教育要求他们成为某一种人，做某一种事，占有某一种地位。李将军一到阿波马托克斯，那种人，那种事，那种地位就都一扫而光了。思嘉呀，瞧你那副傻样子！你想，现在的艾希礼，家没有了，农场也因交税的事而被没收了。至于文雅的绅士，现在一分钱能买２０个。在这种情况下，艾希礼.威尔克斯能干什么呢？他是能用脑子，还是能用手干活呢？我敢打赌，自从让他经管木才厂以厂你的钱是越赔越多了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I have not!”
<p>“How nice. May I look over your books some Sunday evening when you are at leisure?”</p>“You can go to the devil and not at your leisure. You can go now, for all I care.”
<p>“My pet, I’ve been to the devil and he’s a very dull fellow. I won’t go there again, even for you. ... You took my money when you needed it desperately and you used it. We had an agreement as to how it should be used and you have broken that agreement. Just remember, my precious little cheat, the time will come when you will want to borrow more money from me. You’ll want me to bank you, at some incredibly low interest, so you can buy more mills and more mules and build more saloons. And you can whistle for the money.”</p>“When I need money I’ll borrow it from the bank, thank you,” she said coldly, but her breast was heaving with rage.
</div>
  <div class="right">“不对！"<p>“太对了！哪个星期天晚上你有空，给我看看你帐本好吗？"</p>“你见鬼去吧，而且用不着等你有空。你可以走了，随你的便吧。”<p>“我的宝贝儿，鬼我见过了，他是个非常无聊的家伙。我不想再去见他。就是你让我去，我也不去了。……当初你急需用钱，我借给你了，你也用了，我们那时有一个协议，规定这笔钱应该如何用，可你违反了这个协议。请你记住，可爱的小骗子，有朝一日你还要向我借钱的。你会让我资助你，利息低得难以想像，这样你就可以再买几家木材厂，再买几头骡子再开几家酒馆。到那时个，你就别想再弄到一个钱。"</p>“需要钱的时候，我会到银行去借。谢谢你吧，"她冷淡地说，但胸口一起一伏，气得不得了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Will you? Try to do it. I own plenty of stock in the bank.”
<p>“You do?”</p>“Yes, I am interested in some honest enterprises.”
<p>“There are other banks—”</p>“Plenty of them. And if I can manage it, you’ll play hell getting a cent from any of them. You can go to the Carpetbag usurers if you want money.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“是吗？那你就试试看吧，我在银行里有很多的股份。"<p>“真的吗？"</p>“是啊，我对一些可靠的企业很感兴趣。"<p>“还有别的银行嘛--"</p>“银行倒是不少。不过我要是想点办法，你就别想从他们那里借到一分钱，你要是想用钱，去找北方来的高利贷的吧。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’ll go to them with pleasure.”
<p>“You’ll go but with little pleasure when you learn their rates of interest. My pretty, there are penalties in the business world for crooked dealing. You should have played straight with me.”</p>“You’re a fine man, aren’t you? So rich and powerful yet picking on people who are down, like Ashley and me!”
<p>“Don’t put yourself in his class. You aren’t down. Nothing will down you. But he is down and he’ll stay there unless there’s some energetic person behind him, guiding and protecting him as long as he lives. I’m of no mind to have my money used for the benefit of such a person.”</p>“You didn’t mind helping me and I was down and—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我会很高兴去找他们的。"<p>“你可以去找他们，但是一听他们提出的利息，你是会吃惊的，我的小宝贝儿，你应该知道，生意之间，搞鬼是要受罚的。你应该规规矩矩地跟我打交道。"</p>“你不是个好心人吗？又有钱，又有势，何必跟艾希礼和我这样有困难的人过不去呢？"<p>“不要把你自己和他强扯在一起，你根本算不上有困难。因为什么也难不住你，但是他有困难，而且解脱不了，除非他一辈子都有一个强有力的人支持他，引导他，帮助他。我决不希望有人拿我的钱来帮助这样一个人。"</p>“你就曾帮过我的忙，当时我有困难，而且--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You were a good risk, my dear, an interesting risk. Why? Because you didn’t plump yourself down on your male relatives and sob for the old days. You got out and hustled and now your fortunes are firmly planted on money stolen from a dead man’s wallet and money stolen from the Confederacy. You’ve got murder to your credit, and husband stealing, attempted fornication, lying and sharp dealing and any amount of chicanery that won’t bear close inspection. Admirable things, all of them. They show you to be a person of energy and determination and a good money risk. It’s entertaining, helping people who help themselves. I’d lend ten thousand dollars without even a note to that old Roman matron, Mrs. Merriwether. She started with a basket of pies and look at her now! A bakery employing half a dozen people, old Grandpa happy with his delivery wagon and that lazy little Creole, René, working hard and liking it. ... Or that poor devil, Tommy Wellburn, who does two men’s work with half a man’s body and does it well or—well, I won’t go on and bore you.”</div>
  <div class="right">“亲爱的，你是个冒险家，是个很有意思的冒险家，为什么呢？因为你没有依赖亲属中的男人，没有为怀念过去而流泪。你出来大干了一场，现在你的财产有了牢固的基础，这里面不仅有从一位死者的钱包里偷来的钱，还有从联盟偷来的钱。你的成就包括杀人，抢别人的丈夫，有意乱搞，说谎骗人，坑人的交易，还有各种阴谋诡计，没有一项是经得起认真审查的。真是令人佩服。这已足够说明你是一个精力充沛、意志坚强的人，是一个很会赚钱的冒险家。能帮助那些自己肯干的人，是件很愉快的事。我宁愿借一万块钱给那位罗马式的老妇人梅里韦瑟太太，甚至可以不要借据。她是从一篮子馅饼起家的，看看她现在怎么样了！开了一家面包房，有五六个伙计，上了年纪的爷爷高高兴兴地送货，那个法国血统的不爱干活的年轻人雷内，现在也干得很起劲，而且喜欢这份工作。……还有那可怜的托米.韦尔伯恩，他的身体相当于半个人，却干着两个人的活儿，而且干得很好--唉，我不说了，再说你就烦了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You do bore me. You bore me to distraction,” said Scarlett coldly, hoping to annoy him and divert him from the ever-unfortunate subject of Ashley. But he only laughed shortly and refused to take up the gauntlet.
<p>“People like them are worth helping. But Ashley Wilkes—bah! His breed is of no use or value in an upside-down world like ours. Whenever the world up-ends, his kind is the first to perish. And why not? They don’t deserve to survive because they won’t fight—don’t know how to fight. This isn’t the first time the world’s been upside down and it won’t be the last. It’s happened before and it’ll happen again. And when it does happen, everyone loses everything and everyone is equal. And then they all start again at taw, with nothing at all. That is, nothing except the cunning of their brains and strength of their hands. But some people, like Ashley, have neither cunning nor strength or, having them, scruple to use them. And so they go under and they should go under. It’s a natural law and the world is better off without them. But there are always a hardy few who come through and given time, they are right back where they were before the world turned over.”</p>“You’ve been poor! You just said that your father turned you out without a penny!” said Scarlett, furious. “I should think you’d understand and sympathize with Ashley!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我已经烦了，烦得快要发疯了，"她冷冰冰地说了这么一句，故意让他生气，改变话题，不再谈这件涉及艾希礼的倒霉事。而他却只笑了笑，并不理会她的挑战。<p>“像他们这样的人是值得帮助的，而艾希礼.威尔克斯--呸！在我们这样一个天翻地覆的世界里，他这样的人是无用的，是没有价值的。每缝这个世界底儿朝天的时候，首先消失的就是他这样的人，怎么不会这样呢？他们没有资格继续生存下去，因为他们不斗争--也不知道怎样斗争。天翻地覆，这不是第一次，也不是最后一次。过去发生过，以后还会发生。一旦发生天翻地覆的大事变，个人的一切全都失去，人人平等，然后白手起家，大家都重新开始。所谓白手起家，就是说除了脑子好使手有劲之外，别的什么也没有。但有些人，比如艾希礼，脑子既不好使，手也没有劲，或者说，虽然脑子好使手有劲，却顾虑重重，不敢加以利用，就这样，他们沉了底，他们也应该沉底，这是自然规律，除掉这样的人，世界会更美好，但总有少数坚强的人能够挺过来，过些时候，他们就恢复到大事变之前的状况。"</p>“你也过过穷日子！你刚才还说你父亲把你赶出家门的时候，你身无分文，"思嘉气愤地说。"我觉得你应理解而且同情艾希礼才对呀！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">"I do understand;” said Rhett, “but I’m damned if I sympathize. After the surrender Ashley had much more than I had when I was thrown out. At least, he had friends who took him in, whereas I was Ishmael. But what has Ashley done with himself?”
<p>“If you are comparing him with yourself, you conceited thing, why— He’s not like you, thank God! He wouldn’t soil his hands as you do, making money with Carpetbaggers and Scalawags and Yankees. He’s scrupulous and honorable!”</p>“But not too scrupulous and honorable to take aid and money from a woman.”
<p>“What else could he have done?”</p>“Who am I to say? I only know what I did, both when I was thrown out and nowadays. I only know what other men have done. We saw opportunity in the ruin of a civilization and we made the most of our opportunity, some honestly, some shadily, and we are still making the most of it. But the Ashleys of this world have the same chances and don’t take them. They just aren’t smart, Scarlett, and only the smart deserve to survive.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我是理解他的，"瑞德说。“但如果说我同情他，那就见鬼了。南方投降以后，艾希礼的财产比我被赶出家门的时候多得多。他至少有些朋友肯收留他，而我是个被社会唾弃的人，但是艾希礼又为自己做了些什么呢？”<p>“你要是拿他和你自己相比，你这个高傲自负的家伙，那为什么--感谢上帝，他和你不一样，他不愿意你那样把两手弄脏，和北方佬、冒险家投靠北方的人一块儿去赚钱，他是一个谨慎、正直的人。"</p>“可是他并没有因为谨慎、正直而不接受一个女人给他的帮助，给他的钱。"<p>“他不这样又怎么办呢？”</p>“我怎么能说呢？我只知道我自己，被赶出来的时候干了什么，现在干什么。我只知道另外有些男人干了什么。我们发现在旧文明的废墟上有机会可以利用，于是我们就充分利用这个机会。有的光明磊落，有的见不得人，现在我们还尽可能利用这个机会。艾希礼之流在这个世界上也有同样的机会，却不加以利用。他们就是不会想办法，思嘉。而只有会想办法的人才有资格活下去。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She hardly heard what he was saying, for now there was coming back to her the exact memory which had teased her a few minutes before when he first began speaking. She remembered the cold wind that swept the orchard of Tara and Ashley standing by a pile of rails, his eyes looking beyond her. And he had said—what? Some funny foreign name that sounded like profanity and had talked of the end of the world. She had not known what he meant then but now bewildered comprehension was coming to her and with it a sick, weary feeling.</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德说了些什么，思嘉几乎没有听进去，因为瑞德开始讲话时她回想起来的一些模糊印象。现在清楚了，她记得那天冷风吹过塔拉的果园，艾希礼面对着她，站在一堆准备做栏杆的木棍旁，两眼望着远处，他说--他说什么了？他得到一个很滑稽的外国名字，听起来像是异教徒的语言，他还谈到了世界的末日，当时她不理解他的意思，现在她明白了，感到非常吃惊，同时也有一种疲倦、不适的感觉。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why, Ashley said—”
<p>“Yes?”</p>“Once at Tara he said something about the—a—dusk of the gods and about the end of the world and some such foolishness.”
<p>“Ah, the Gotterdammerung!” Rhett’s eyes were sharp with interest. “And what else?”</p>“Oh, I don’t remember exactly. I wasn’t paying much mind. But—yes—something about the strong coming through and the weak being winnowed out.”
</div>
  <div class="right">哎，艾希礼说过--”<p>“他说过什么？”</p>“在塔拉的时候，他有一天谈到--谈到诸神的末日，谈到世界的末日，以及诸如类的傻话。"<p>“啊，Gotterdammerung!"瑞德的眼神表现出极大的兴趣。"他还说什么？"</p>“唉，记不清了，我当时也没注意听。噢，对了，他还说过什么强者通过，弱者被淘汰。"</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Ah, so he knows. Then that makes it harder for him. Most of them don’t know and will never know. They’ll wonder all their lives where the lost enchantment has vanished. They’ll simply suffer in proud and incompetent silence. But he understands. He knows he’s winnowed out.”
<p>“Oh, he isn’t! Not while I’ve got breath in my body.”</p>He looked at her quietly and his brown face was smooth.
<p>“Scarlett, how did you manage to get his consent to come to Atlanta and take over the mill? Did he struggle very hard against you?”</p>She had a quick memory of the scene with Ashley after Gerald’s funeral and put it from her.
</div>
  <div class="right">"这么说，他是清楚的。这他就更难以忍受了。他们大部分人不清楚，也永远弄不清楚。他们一辈子都弄不明白，失去的幻影消失到哪里去了，他们只好默默地忍受着一切，既感到高傲，又感到无能为力，但艾希礼和他们不同，他是清楚的，他知道自己已被淘汰了。"<p>“不对，他没有被淘汰！只要我还有一口气，就不能让他被淘汰。"</p>瑞德静静地看着思嘉，他那棕色的脸膛是舒展的。<p>“思嘉。你是怎么取得他的同意，到亚特兰大来为你经营这个木材厂的？当时他有没有极力推辞？"</p>思嘉马上想起父亲葬礼之后她和艾希礼谈话的情景，但随即置之脑后。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why, of course not,” she replied indignantly. “When I explained to him that I needed his help because I didn’t trust that scamp who was running the mill and Frank was too busy to help me and I was going to—well, there was Ella Lorena, you see. He was very glad to help me out.”
<p>“Sweet are the uses of motherhood! So that’s how you got around him. Well, you’ve got him where you want him now, poor devil, as shackled to you by obligations as any of your convicts are by their chains. And I wish you both joy. But, as I said at the beginning of this discussion, you’ll never get another cent out of me for any of your little unladylike schemes, my double-dealing lady.”</p>She was smarting with anger and with disappointment as well. For some time she had been planning to borrow more money from Rhett to buy a lot downtown and start a lumber yard there.
</div>
  <div class="right">“当然没有，"他显得很生气的样子回答道，"我对他说我需要他帮忙，因为当时我信不过经管木材的那个家伙，弗兰克自己又忙得顾不上帮我，而且我也快要--快要生这个小爱拉了。他是很愿意来给我帮忙的。"<p>“拿做母亲当借口可真是个不错的理由！原来你是这样说服他的。现在你把这个可怜虫放到你需要他的地方，并用他的责任心把他拴住，和用链子把你那些犯人拴住是没有区别的。我祝你们二人幸福。不过刚才一开始我就说了，今后不管你耍什么见不得人的鬼把戏，也别想再从我这里得到一分钱。你这个两面三刀的女人。"</p>思嘉既生气，又失望，非常难过。她已经盘算了很久，想再向瑞德借钱在城里买一块地，再开一家木材厂。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I can do without your money,” she cried. “I’m making money out of Johnnie Gallegher’s mill, plenty of it, now that I don’t use free darkies and I have some money out on mortgages and we are coining cash at the store from the darky trade.”
<p>“Yes, so I heard. How clever of you to rook the helpless and the widow and the orphan and the ignorant! But if you must steal, Scarlett, why not steal from the rich and strong instead of the poor and weak? From Robin Hood on down to now, that’s been considered highly moral.”</p>“Because,” said Scarlett shortly, “it’s a sight easier and safer to steal—as you call it—from the poor.”
<p>He laughed silently, his shoulders shaking.</p>“You’re a fine honest rogue, Scarlett!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我用不着你的钱。"她说。"我靠约翰尼.加勒格尔那个厂，赚了很多钱，因为现在不用自由的黑人了。我还有作抵押的钱，而且我们的店做黑人生意，也很赚钱。"<p>“是啊，我听说了！你可真聪明，专门找那些生活没有着落的人，孤儿寡妇，愚昧无知的人，从他们身上捞钱。思嘉，你要是非捞不可，为什么不去找那些有钱有势的人，而非找这些软弱的穷人呢？自从罗宾汉到现在，劫富济贫才是最高尚的行为！"</p>“那是因为穷人的钱好捞得多，而且捞起来也安全得多--姑且就用说你的这个"捞"字吧"思嘉直截了当地说。<p>他悄悄地笑起来，连肩膀都抖动了。</p>“思嘉，你是一个很坦率的流氓！”</div></div>

  <div class="left">A rogue! Queer that that term should hurt. She wasn’t a rogue, she told herself vehemently. At least, that wasn’t what she wanted to be. She wanted to be a great lady. For a moment her mind went swiftly down the years and she saw her mother, moving with a sweet swish of skirts and a faint fragrance of sachet, her small busy hands tireless in the service of others, loved, respected, cherished. And suddenly her heart was sick.</div>
  <div class="right">流氓！这话也能使她伤心，真有意思。她激动地对自己说，我可不是流氓埃,至少她并不想去当流氓。她想当一个有地位的上等人。她突然回想起很多年前的情况，仿佛看见母亲在走来走去，层层的裙子沙沙作响，随身的香囊散发着清香，两只小手不知疲倦地为别人操劳，赢得了人们的爱戴、尊敬和怀念。想到这里，她心里突然感到非常难受。</div></div>

  <div class="left">“If you are trying to devil me,” she said tiredly, “it’s no use. I know I’m not as—scrupulous as I should be these days. Not as kind and as pleasant as I was brought up to be. But I can’t help it, Rhett. Truly, I can’t. What else could I have done? What would have happened to me, to Wade, to Tara and all of us if I’d been—gentle when that Yankee came to Tara? I should have been—but I don’t even want to think of that. And when Jonas Wilkerson was going to take the home place, suppose I’d been—kind and scrupulous? Where would we all be now? And if I’d been sweet and simple minded and not nagged Frank about bad debts we’d—oh, well. Maybe I am a rogue, but I won’t be a rogue forever, Rhett. But during these past years—and even now—what else could I have done? How else could I have acted? I’ve felt that I was trying to row a heavily loaded boat in a storm. I’ve had so much trouble just trying to keep afloat that I couldn’t be bothered about things that didn’t matter, things I could part with easily and not miss, like good manners and—well, things like that. I’ve been too afraid my boat would be swamped and so I’ve dumped overboard the things that seemed least important.”</div>
  <div class="right">“你要是存心折磨我，那全是白费功夫，"她说，脸上显得有些疲倦。"我知道我近来已放松应有的谨慎，也不像小时候的教育要求的那样宽厚、和气。可是，瑞德，我也是没有办法呀。的确是没办法。不这样做又怎么办呢？那个北方佬闯进塔拉的时候，我要是手软一点，会怎么样呢？我和韦德，整个塔拉，我们所有的人，会有什么结果呢？我当时是应该--不过现在我连想也不愿意想了。还有乔斯.威尔克森来抢占房子的时候，我要是宽宏、谨慎又会怎么样呢？我们大家现在住到哪里去呢？还有我当时要是天真、顺从而没有盯着弗兰克去解决那倒霉的债务税金，我们就会--唉，不要说了。也许我是个流氓，瑞德，但我不会永远愿意当流氓的。可是这些年来，甚至现在，不这样又怎么办呢？我有什么别的出路呢？我觉得仿佛是在风暴中划一只装载很满的船，勉强保持在水面上已经很不容易了。我哪里还顾得上那些无关要紧的东西，那些放弃也并不可惜的东西，比如仪态端庄，以及--以及如此类型的东西，我非常害怕船会沉下去，就把看起来最不重要的东西全扔掉了。"</div></div>

  <div class="left">“Pride and honor and truth and virtue and kindliness,” he enumerated silkily. “You are right, Scarlett. They aren’t important when a boat is sinking. But look around you at your friends. Either they are bringing their boats ashore safely with cargoes intact or they are content to go down with all flags flying.”
<p>“They are a passel of fools,” she said shortly. “There’s a time for all things. When I’ve got plenty of money, I’ll be nice as you please, too. Butter won’t melt in my mouth. I can afford to be then.”</p>You can afford to be—but you won’t. It’s hard to salvage jettisoned cargo and, if it is retrieved, it’s usually irreparably damaged. And I fear that when you can afford to fish up the honor and virtue and kindness you’ve thrown overboard, you’ll find they have suffered a sea change and not, I fear, into something rich and strange. ...”
</div>
  <div class="right">“自尊心、体面、真诚、纯洁、宽厚，"他和颜悦色地一一列举。“思嘉，你做得很对呀！船要沉的时候，这些东西是重要的，可是看一看你周围的朋友吧，他们或者把船安全地划到岸边，使货物完好无损，或者宁愿仪容整平地全船覆没。"<p>“他们是一群大傻瓜，"她怒气冲冲地说。"此一时彼一时嘛，等我有了很多钱，我也会像说的那样好好地去做人，我会做一个老实忠厚的人。到时候我就做得起老实人了。"</p>“现在你也做得起--但是你并不愿意去做。落水后的货物是难以打捞上来的即使打捞上来，也往往损坏得面目全非，无法恢复原状了。恐怕等你认为有能力把你扔掉的体面、纯洁与宽厚打捞上来的时候，你会发现它们已经在海里起了很大变化，但我想并没有变得充实，变得新奇。……"</div></div>

  <div class="left">He rose suddenly and picked up his hat.
<p>“You are going?”</p>“Yes. Aren’t you relieved? I leave you to what remains of your conscience.”
<p>He paused and looked down at the baby, putting out a finger for the child to grip.</p>“I suppose Frank is bursting with pride?”
</div>
  <div class="right">他突然站起来，拿起帽子。<p>“你要走吗？”</p>“是的。你不觉得松了一口气吗？你要是还有良心的话，我走以后，你就好好扪心自问自己的良心吧。"<p>说到这里，他停了下来，低头看了看孩子，伸出一个手指让孩子来抓。</p>“我想弗兰克一定美得很吧？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, of course.”
<p>“Has a lot of plans for this baby, I suppose?”</p>“Oh, well, you know how silly men are about their babies.”
<p>“Then, tell him,” said Rhett and stopped short, an odd look on his face, “tell him if he wants to see his plans for his child work out, he’d better stay home at night more often than he’s doing.”</p>“What do you mean?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“当然了，当然。”<p>“我想他一定为孩子作了很多按排？”</p>“哎呀，你难道不知道男人对孩子总是胡思乱想。"<p>“那就告诉他，"瑞德说到这里突然停下来，脸上有一种奇怪的表情。"告诉他如果他想实现他对孩子的那些安排，他就最好晚上多待在家里，而不要像现在这样。"</p>“你这是什么意思？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Just what I say. Tell him to stay home.”
<p>“Oh, you vile creature! To insinuate that poor Frank would—”</p>“Oh, good Lord!” Rhett broke into a roar of laughter. “I didn’t mean he was running around with women! Frank! Oh, good Lord!”
<p>He went down the steps still laughing.</p></div>
  <div class="right">“没有什么别的意思，告诉他待在家里。"<p>“你这个坏蛋！你怎么敢说可怜的弗兰克会—-"</p>“哎呀，我的天啊！"瑞德放声大笑起来。"我不是说他去玩儿女人去了！弗兰克！啊，我的天啊！"<p>他一边笑着，一边走下台阶。</p></div></div>
