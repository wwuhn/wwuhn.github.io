  Second arrival of Atlanta</div> <div class="right3"></div>  </div>

</div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">A COLD WIND was blowing stiffly and the scudding clouds overhead were the deep gray of slate when Scarlett and Mammy stepped from the train in Atlanta the next afternoon. The depot had not been rebuilt since the burning of the city and they alighted amid cinders and mud a few yards above the blackened ruins which marked the site. Habit strong upon her, Scarlett looked about for Uncle Peter and Pitty’s carriage, for she had always been met by them when returning from Tara to Atlanta during the war years. Then she caught herself with a sniff at her own absent-mindedness. Naturally, Peter wasn’t there for she had given Aunt Pitty no warning of her coming and, moreover, she remembered that one of the old lady’s letters had dealt tearfully with the death of the old nag Peter had “ ‘quired” in Macon to bring her back to Atlanta after the surrender.</div>
  <div class="right">第二天一早，思嘉和嬷嬷迎着寒风凛冽和彤云疾卷的阴沉天气在亚特兰大下了火车。火车站在全城大火中毁了，还没有重建起来，她们是在那堆高出废墟好几码的灰烬和烂泥中跳下来的，它们告诉人们，这里就是火车站了。思嘉习惯性的环顾一下周围，寻找彼得大叔和皮蒂姑妈的马车，因为在战争年月每次她从塔拉回到亚特兰大时都是他们来接的。随即她忽然醒悟起来，对自己的下意识举动一笑置之。当然了，彼得没有来，因为她并没有把自己要到这里来的事预先通告皮蒂姑妈，而且她想起老太太在有一封信里悲伤地说过，投降后彼得在梅里要求领回来的那匹老马已经死了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She looked about the rutted and cut-up space around the depot for the equipage of some old friend or acquaintance who might drive them to Aunt Pitty’s house but she recognized no one, black or white. Probably none of her old friends owned carriages now, if what Pitty had written them was true. Times were so hard it was difficult to feed and lodge humans, much less animals. Most of Pitty’s friends, like herself, were afoot these days.
<p>There were a few wagons loading at the freight cars and several mud-splashed buggies with rough-looking strangers at the reins but only two carriages. One was a closed carriage, the other open and occupied by a well-dressed woman and a Yankee officer. Scarlett drew in her breath sharply at the sight of the uniform. Although Pitty had written that Atlanta was garrisoned and the streets full of soldiers, the first sight of the bluecoat startled and frightened her. It was hard to remember that the war was over and that this man would not pursue her, rob her and insult her.</p></div>
  <div class="right">她环顾车站周围车辙纵横和被分割得零零碎碎的空地，想找到一位老朋友和旧相识的马车，好恳求人家把她们带到皮蒂姑妈的住处去，可是无论黑人白人她一个也不认识。如果皮蒂写信告诉他们的情况属实，也许她的熟人中谁都没有马车了。时世这么艰苦，人有吃有住就很不容易了，那顾得上牲畜。皮蒂的大多数朋友，像她自己一样，现在都是双脚步行了。<p>有很少几辆货车在运化车厢旁装货，还有几辆溅满了泥污的四轮单座马，车上坐着粗壮的车夫，但载人的车只有两辆，其中一辆是轿车，另一辆是逢车，里面坐着一个穿着华丽的妇人和一个军官。思嘉一见那身制服便狠狠地吸了一口气。尽管皮蒂姑妈在信中说过亚特兰大驻扎一军队，街上到处是大兵，思嘉猛一见到这些穿蓝军服的人还是觉得惊异和害怕。这很难使人感到战争已经结束，也难相信这些人不会追逐她，抢劫她，侮辱她。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The comparative emptiness around the train took her mind back to that morning in 1862 when she had come to Atlanta as a young widow, swathed in crêpe and wild with boredom. She recalled how crowded this space had been with wagons and carriages and ambulances and how noisy with drivers swearing and yelling and people calling greetings to friends. She sighed for the light-hearted excitement of the war days and sighed again at the thought of walking all the way to Aunt Pitty’s house. But she was hopeful that once on Peachtree Street, she might meet someone she knew who would give them a ride.
<p>As she stood looking about her a saddle-colored negro of middle age drove the dosed carriage toward her and, leaning from the box, questioned: “Cah’ige, lady? Two bits fer any whar in ‘Lanta.”</p>Mammy threw him an annihilating glance.
</div>
  <div class="right">车站周围空荡荡的景象使她想起１８６２年的一个早晨，那时她作为年轻寡妇身穿丧服、满怀厌倦地来到了亚特兰大。她记得这个地方当时多么拥挤，到处是货车、客车和运送伤员的车辆，车夫们的漫骂声和叹息声，人们迎接朋友的招呼声汇成一片喧闹，她不禁为战时那种心情轻松愉快的景象而感叹，接着又叹息又如今不得不步行到皮蒂姑妈家去。但他仍然满怀希望，觉得只要到了桃树街，她就会遇到熟人让她们搭车。<p>正当她站在那里环顾观望时，一个棕色皮肤的中年黑人赶着一辆轿车向她驶来，并从车里探出身来问：“要车吗，太太？两块钱，到亚特兰大城里啥地方都行。</p>“嬷嬷恶狠狠地瞪了他一眼。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“A hired hack!” she rumbled. “Nigger, does you know who we is?”
<p>Mammy was a country negro but she had not always been a country negro and she knew that no chaste woman ever rode in a hired conveyance—especially a closed carriage—without the escort of some male member of her family. Even the presence of a negro maid would not satisfy the conventions. She gave Scarlett a glare as she saw her look longingly at the hack.</p>“Come ‘way frum dar, Miss Scarlett! A hired hack an’ a free issue nigger! Well, dat’s a good combination.”
<p>“Ah ain’ no free issue nigger,” declared the driver with heat. “Ah b’longs ter Ole Miss Talbot an’ disyere her cah’ige an’ Ah drives it ter mek money fer us.”</p>“Whut Miss Talbot is dat?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“是辆野鸡车！"她嘀古着，"黑鬼，你把我们当成什么人了？"嬷<p>嬷是个乡下黑人，但她又并不经常住乡下；她清楚没有哪个体面妇女会坐野鸡车，尤其是轿车的，除非家里有男人在身边护送。即使有个黑人侍女跟在身边，从习俗上讲也还是不够的。嬷嬷看见思嘉仍在恋恋不舍地打量那辆出租马车，便恶狠狠地瞪了她一眼。</p>“我们走吧，思嘉小姐！一辆野鸡车和一个刚刚冒出来的黑鬼！不错，真是个好搭档！"<p>“我可不是刚冒出来的自由黑人。"车夫生气地辩解道。“我是老塔尔拍特小姐家的。这是她家的马车，我赶出来给家里挣点钱花。”</p>“哪个老塔尔伯特小姐？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Miss Suzannah Talbot of Milledgeville. Us done move up hyah affer Old Marse wuz kilt.”
<p>“Does you know her, Miss Scarlett?”</p>“No,” said Scarlett, regretfully. “I know so few Milledgeville folks.”
<p>“Den us’ll walk,” said Mammy sternly. “Drive on, nigger.”</p>She picked up the carpetbag which held Scarlett’s new velvet frock and bonnet and nightgown and tucked the neat bandanna bundle that contained her own belongings under her arm and shepherded Scarlett across the wet expanse of cinders. Scarlett did not argue the matter, much as she preferred to ride, for she wished no disagreement with Mammy. Ever since yesterday afternoon when Mammy had caught her with the velvet curtains, there had been an alert suspicious look in her eyes which Scarlett did not like. It was going to be difficult to escape from her chaperonage and she did not intend to rouse Mammy’s fighting blood before it was absolutely necessary.
</div>
  <div class="right">“米尔格维尔的苏珊娜.塔尔伯特小姐呀。我们是老马尔斯被打死以后搬到这里来的。"<p>“你认识她吗，思嘉小姐？”</p>“不认识，"思嘉遗憾地说。"我认识的米尔格维尔人很少。"<p>“那好，我们走，“嬷嬷断然地说。"你赶你的车吧，黑鬼。"</p>她提起里面装着思嘉的新天鹅绒长袍、帽子和睡衣的帆衣布袋，把包着自己衣物的干净包袱夹在腋下，然后领着思嘉走过到处是煤渣和灰烬的湿地。思嘉尽管想坐车，但没和她理论，因为她不想与嬷嬷发生争执。自头一天午她摘窗帘被嬷嬷抓住，嬷嬷眼里始流露出一副警惕的疑惑神情，这是思嘉很厌烦的。看来难以逃脱她的陪伴，而且只要不是必须要求，她也并不想激起嬷嬷的好斗脾气。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As they walked along the narrow sidewalk toward Peachtree, Scarlett was dismayed and sorrowful, for Atlanta looked so devastated and different from what she remembered. They passed beside what had been the Atlanta Hotel where Rhett and Uncle Henry had lived and of that elegant hostelry there remained only a shell, a part of the blackened walls. The warehouses which had bordered the train tracks for a quarter of a mile and held tons of military supplies had not been rebuilt and their rectangular foundations looked dreary under the dark sky. Without the wall of buildings on either side and with the car shed gone, the railroad tracks seemed bare and exposed. Somewhere amid these ruins, undistinguishable from the others, lay what remained of her own warehouse on the property Charles had left her. Uncle Henry had paid last year’s taxes on it for her. She’d have to repay that money some time. That was something else to worry about.</div>
  <div class="right">她们沿着狭窄的人行道向桃树街走去，思嘉一路上都感到惊恐和悲伤，因为亚特兰大已经变得如此荒凉，跟她记忆中的情景大不一样了。她们走过从前瑞德和享利大叔叔住过的亚特兰大饭店所在地，如今那高雅的建筑只剩下一个空架和部分焦黑的断垣残壁了。那些毗连铁路长达四分之一英里、存放着大量军需品的库房还没重建起来，它们那些长方形屋基在灰暗的天空下看来分外凄凉。由于两旁都没有了建筑物的墙壁，同时车库已经消失，因此火车道上的铁轨便显得赤裸裸地毫无遮掩了。这些废墟中有一个与别处没有什么区别的地方，还保留着查尔斯留给她的产业上的仓库遗址。享利叔叔已经替她付过去年的租金。过些时她得偿还这笔钱。这又是一件叫她烦恼的事。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As they turned the corner into Peachtree Street and she looked toward Five Points, she cried out with shock. Despite all Frank had told her about the town burning to the ground, she had never really visualized complete destruction. In her mind the town she loved so well still stood full of close-packed buildings and fine houses. But this Peachtree Street she was looking upon was so denuded of landmarks it was as unfamiliar as if she had never seen it before. This muddy street down which she had driven a thousand times during the war, along which she had fled with ducked head and fear-quickened legs when shells burst over her during the siege, this street she had last seen in the heat and hurry and anguish of the day of the retreat, was so strange looking she felt like crying.</div>
  <div class="right">她们拐了个弯走进桃树街时，她向五点镇望去，不禁大声惊叫起来，尽管佛兰克告诉过她城镇已被大火夷为平地，她也从没想到这样彻底的毁灭。在她心目中，她所热爱的那个城镇仍然处处是密集的建筑物和漂亮的房子。可是她现在看到的这条桃树街连一个旧的标志也没有了，它显得如此陌生，仿佛她从没见过似的。这条泥泞的大街，战时她曾驾车走过千百次的大街，围城时她低着头冒着在空中开花的炮弹慌慌张张奔跑过的大街，她在撤离那天紧张匆忙而痛苦的时刻最后告别的大街，如今竟是这样陌生，以致她伤心得要哭了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Though many new buildings had sprung up in the year since Sherman marched out of the burning town and the Confederates returned, there were still wide vacant lots around Five Points where heaps of smudged broken bricks lay amid a jumble of rubbish, dead weeds and broom-sedge. There were the remains of a few buildings she remembered, roofless brick walls through which the dull daylight shone, glassless windows gaping, chimneys towering lonesomely. Here and there her eyes gladly picked out a familiar store which had partly survived shell and fire and had been repaired, the fresh red of new brick glaring bright against the smut of the old walls. On new store fronts and new office windows she saw the welcome names of men she knew but more often the names were unfamiliar, especially the dozens of shingles of strange doctors and lawyers and cotton merchants. Once she had known practically everyone in Atlanta and the sight of so many strange names depressed her. But she was cheered by the sight of new buildings going up all along the street.</div>
  <div class="right">尽管自从谢尔曼在大火中撤出这座城镇和联盟军回来那一年起，这里已陆续重建了许多新房子，可是五点镇周围依然有大片大片的空地，荒榛枯草中是一堆堆烧焦的断砖碎瓦，其中又有几幢房子的遗址是她能勉强辩认出来的，房子只剩下几截砖墙在暗淡的阳光里兀立着，没有玻璃的窗户张开大口，摇摇欲坠的烟囱显得分外孤单。她也偶尔高兴地看见一两家熟悉的店铺，那是在炮火中幸存下来并修复了的，其中那些耀眼的新红砖与灰色的旧墙形成强烈的对照。她从那些新店铺门面和新办公楼的窗口看到令人兴奋的旧相识的牌号，但更多的名字是不的熟悉的，尤其那成百上千的陌行医生、律师和棉花商的牌号。以前她在亚特兰大几乎认识每个人，而现在眼前出现了这么多陌生的名字，这使她感到丧气。当然，眼看着街道两旁新建筑物迎面而来，她也不能不为之振奋。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">There were dozens of them and several were three stories high! Everywhere building was going on, for as she looked down the street, trying to adjust her mind to the new Atlanta, she heard the blithe sound of hammers and saws, noticed scaffoldings rising and saw men climbing ladders with hods of bricks on their shoulders. She looked down the street she loved so well and her eyes misted a little.
<p>“They burned you,” she thought, “and they laid you flat. But they didn’t lick you. They couldn’t lick you. You’ll grow back just as big and sassy as you used to be!”</p>As she walked along Peachtree, followed by the waddling Mammy, she found the sidewalks just as crowded as they were at the height of the war and there was the same air of rush and bustle about the resurrecting town which had made her blood sing when she came here, so long ago, on her first visit to Aunt Pitty. There seemed to be just as many vehicles wallowing in the mud holes as there had been then, except that there were no Confederate ambulances, and just as many horses and mules tethered to hitching racks in front of the wooden awnings of the stores. Though the sidewalks were jammed, the faces she saw were as unfamiliar as the signs overhead, new people, many rough-looking men and tawdrily dressed women. The streets were black with loafing negroes who leaned against walls or sat on the curbing watching vehicles go past with the naive curiosity of children at a circus parade.
</div>
  <div class="right">这些建筑物也是成百千的，有些还是三层楼房呢！到处都处在兴建新房子。她在大街上朝前望去，想要让自己的观念适应这新的亚特兰大，这时她耳边是一片欢快的锯子声和锒头声，眼前是一个又一个高耸的脚手架，人们扛着砖头在梯子上攀登。她朝前望去，望着这条自己那么喜爱的大街，眼睛不觉有点湿润了。她心想：<p>“他们把你烧成灰烬了，他们把你夷为了平地，可是他们并没有把你打垮。他们打不垮你。你重获新生，变得像你过去那样雄伟，那样壮丽！"</p>她顺着桃树街往前走。后面跟着蹒跚的嬷嬷。一路发现人行道上仍像战争紧张时期那么拥挤，这复苏的城镇周围仍然是那种仓皇喧扰的气氛，许久以前，她头一次拜访皮蒂姑妈来到这里时，这城镇曾使她极为兴奋，仿佛浑身血液都要歌唱似的，如今也像当时一样有那么多的车辆（只不过没有运送伤员的军车）在泥泞中挣扎，有那么多马匹和骡子拴在店铺木棚前面的拴马桩上。人行道上拥挤不堪，她所看到的面孔像头顶上的招牌一样，都是陌生的，都是些新人，许许多多容貌粗鲁的男人和穿着俗丽的女人。街上到处是游手好闲的黑人，有的斜靠着墙壁，有的坐在路边石上，像小孩天真地看马戏团游行的一样，好奇地观看着过往的车辆。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Free issue country niggers,” snorted Mammy. “Ain’ never seed a proper cah’ige in dere lives. An’ impident lookin’, too.”
<p>They were impudent looking, Scarlett agreed, for they stared at her in an insolent manner, but she forgot them in the renewed shock of seeing blue uniforms. The town was full of Yankee soldiers, on horses, afoot, in army wagons, loafing on the street, reeling out of barrooms.</p>I’ll never get used to them, she thought, clenching her fists. Never! and over her shoulder: “Hurry, Mammy, let’s get out of this crowd.”
<p>“Soon’s Ah kick dis black trash outer mah way,” answered Mammy loudly, swinging the carpetbag at a black buck who loitered tantalizingly in front of her and making him leap aside. “Ah doan lak disyere town, Miss Scarlett. It’s too full of Yankees an’ cheap free issue.”</p>“It’s nicer where it isn’t so crowded. When we get across Five Points, it won’t be so bad.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“尽是些刚放出来的自由黑鬼！"嬷嬷打鼻子里哼了一声。“他们一辈子都没有个体面样儿。还有那一脸的粗鲁相。"<p>他们就是一副粗鲁相，思嘉也这样想，因为他们总是无礼地盯着她，不过她一看到那些穿蓝军服的大兵，便吓得把这些黑人忘记了。城里到处是北方佬士兵，有的骑着马，有的步行，有的坐在军车里，在街上闲档，从酒吧间出出进进。</p>我永远也看不惯这些家伙，她握紧双拳，心里想。永远也不会！一面回过头去对嬷嬷说：“快说，嬷嬷，赶快离开这群家伙。"<p>“等我踢开这些挡路的黑鬼再说，"嬷嬷大声回答道，一面用提包猛撞那个在她前面故意慢悠悠地磨蹭的黑人，使他不得不闪到一边去了。"我不喜欢这个城镇，思嘉小姐。这里北方佬和刚放出来的黑鬼太多了。"</p>“那些不怎么拥挤的地方会好一些。只要我们过了五点镇，就不会这样了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">They picked their way across the slippery stepping stones that bridged the mud of Decatur Street and continued up Peachtree, through a thinning crowd. When they reached Wesley Chapel where Scarlett had paused to catch her breath that day in 1864 when she had run for Dr. Meade, she looked at it and laughed aloud, shortly and grimly. Mammy’s quick old eyes sought hers with suspicion and question but her curiosity went unsatisfied. Scarlett was recalling with contempt the terror which had ridden her that day. She had been crawling with fear, rotten with fear, terrified by the Yankees, terrified by the approaching birth of Beau. Now she wondered how she could have been so frightened, frightened like a child at a loud noise. And what a child she had been to think that Yankees and fire and defeat were the worst things that could happen to her! What trivialities they were beside Ellen’s death and Gerald’s vagueness, beside hunger and cold and back-breaking work and the living nightmare of insecurity. How easy she would find it now to be brave before an invading army, but how hard to face the danger that threatened Tara! No, she would never again be afraid of anything except poverty.</div>
  <div class="right">她们择路越过那些放置在迪凯特街泥泞里的溜滑的垫脚石，然后继续顺桃树街往前走。这里行人比较稀疏了。她们到了韦斯利礼拜堂，这是１８６４年思嘉去找米德大夫那天停下来歇口气的地方，现在她注视着它，不由得鄙夷地冷冷一笑。嬷嬷的机警眼光带着猜疑和询问的神色搜索她，但她的好奇心没有获得满足。原来思嘉是在回想那天自己的恐惧心情，觉得太可笑了。那时她被北方佬吓坏了，被媚兰既将分娩的紧张状况吓坏了，简直是在心惊胆战地爬行埃现在想起来，她真不明白有什么必要那样害怕，就像孩子听到一声巨声那样害怕呢？而且那时她觉得，北方佬和大火，以及战争失败的结局，将是她可能碰到的最坏的事情。可它们同爱伦的死和杰拉尔德的精神恍惚比起来，同饥饿，同累断脊梁的劳动和面临不安全的活生生的梦魇比起来，是多么无关紧要的事啊！如今叫她在侵略军面前英勇无畏，那是很容易做到的，可是要面对塔拉被侵吞的危险却显得非常困难了。不，除了挨饿，她什么也不怕！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Up Peachtree came a closed carriage and Scarlett went to the curb eagerly to see if she knew the occupant, for Aunt Pitty’s house was still several blocks away. She and Mammy leaned forward as the carriage came abreast and Scarlett, with a smile arranged, almost called out when a woman’s head appeared for a moment at the window—a too bright red head beneath a fine fur hat. Scarlett took a step back as mutual recognition leaped into both faces. It was Belle Watling and Scarlett had a glimpse of nostrils distended with dislike before she disappeared again. Strange that Belle’s should be the first familiar face she saw.</div>
  <div class="right">一辆轿式马车在桃树街迎面驶来，思嘉急切地站到路边石上瞧是否认识车上的人，因为皮蒂姑妈的住处离这里还有好几条街呢。马车路过身边，她和嬷嬷都凑近去细看，这时思嘉正准备露出一个微笑，可是当轿车窗口探出一个女人的头--一个戴着高贵的毛皮帽的红得耀眼的头时，她几乎失声喊叫起来。原来双方都认出来了，脸上都露出惊异的神情，思嘉更不由得后退了一步。这是贝尔.沃特琳！在她再次缩回头去之前，思嘉还瞧见她那两只因表示憎恶而张大的鼻孔。真奇怪，她首先看到的那张熟悉面孔竟然是贝尔的！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Who dat?” questioned Mammy suspiciously. “She knowed you but she din’ bow. Ah ain’ never seed ha’r dat color in mah life. Not even in de Tarleton fambly. It look—well, it look dyed ter me!”
<p>“It is,” said Scarlett shortly, walking faster.</p>“Does you know a dyed-ha’rd woman? Ah ast you who she is.”
<p>“She’s the town bad woman,” said Scarlett briefly, “and I give you my word I don’t know her, so shut up.”</p>“Gawdlmighty!” breathed Mammy, her jaw dropping as she looked after the carriage with passionate curiosity. She had not seen a professional bad woman since she left Savannah with Ellen more than twenty years before and she wished ardently that she had observed Belle more closely.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是谁呀？"嬷嬷猜疑地问。"她认识你却不向你鞠躬。我可一辈子也没见过这样颜色的头发。就连在塔尔顿家也没见过。可好像—-嗯，我看是染过的！"<p>“是染过，"思嘉不屑地回答了一声，加快了脚步。</p>“你认识一个染了发的女人？我问你，她究竟是谁？"<p>“她是一个坏女人，"思嘉简捷地回答说。"我向你保证，我并不认识她，你别问了。"</p>“天哪，"嬷嬷轻轻叹了一口气，用满怀好奇的眼光望着那辆驶去的马车，呆呆地连下颚都快掉下来了。自从二十年前她同爱伦离开萨凡纳以来，还从没见过妓女，因此她很遗憾刚才没有仔细看个清楚。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“She sho dressed up fine an’ got a fine cah’ige an’ coachman,” she muttered. “Ah doan know whut de Lawd thinkin’ ‘bout lettin’ de bad women flurrish lak dat w’en us good folks is hongry an’ mos’ barefoot.”
<p>“The Lord stopped thinking about us years ago,” said Scarlett savagely. “And don’t go telling me Mother is turning in her grave to hear me say it, either.”</p>She wanted to feel superior and virtuous about Belle but she could not. If her plans went well, she might be on the same footing with Belle and supported by the same man. While she did not regret her decision one whit, the matter in its true light discomfited her. “I won’t think of it now,” she told herself and hurried her steps.
</div>
  <div class="right">“她穿得这么华丽，还有这么漂亮的一辆马车和一个车夫，"她喃喃地自言自语。"我不懂上帝安的什么心，让那些坏女人这样享福，而我们好人倒要饿肚子，打赤脚。"<p>“很久以来上帝就不管我们了，"思嘉粗鲁地说。"可是你也不用对我说，母亲听我这种话会在坟墓里翻来覆去睡不着。"</p>她理应觉得自己在社会地位和德行上高于贝尔，但是做不到。如果她的计划能顺利进行，她就会处于贝尔同样的地位并受到同一个男人的资助了。她尽管对自己的决定一点也不后悔，但这件事实质上还是使她感到难堪的。"我现在不去想它，"她心里对自己说，同时加快了脚步。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">They passed the lot where the Meade house had stood and there remained of it only a forlorn pair of stone steps and a walk, leading up to nothing. Where the Whitings’ home had been was bare ground. Even the foundation stones and the brick chimneys were gone and there were wagon tracks where they had been carted away. The brick house of the Elsings still stood, with a new roof and a new second floor. The Bonnell home, awkwardly patched and roofed with rude boards instead of shingles, managed to look livable for all its battered appearance. But in neither house was there a face at the window or a figure on the porch, and Scarlett was glad. She did not want to talk to anyone now.
<p>Then the new slate roof of Aunt Pitty’s house came in view with its red-brick walls, and Scarlett’s heart throbbed. How good of the Lord not to level it beyond repair! Coming out of the front yard was Uncle Peter, a market basket on his arm, and when he saw Scarlett and Mammy trudging along, a wide, incredulous smile split his black face.</p>"I could kiss the old black fool, I’m so glad to see him, thought Scarlett, joyfully and she called: “Run get Auntie’s swoon bottle, Peter! It’s really me!”
</div>
  <div class="right">她们经过以前米德大夫住宅所在的那个地段，可是住宅只剩下两个石级和一条走道，上面什么都没有了。至于原来惠廷家所在的地方，如今已完全夷为平地，连那些屋基石和砖的烟囱也不见了，只有运走它们留下的车轮痕迹还依稀可辩。埃尔辛家的砖房仍兀立在那里，而且新盖了二楼层和一个新的屋顶，邦内尔家修补得很难看，上面用粗木板当瓦盖了个屋顶，看来是在设法掩饰那副破烂相，想尽量显得适合于居祝然而，这些房子的窗口没有一张面孔露出来，门廊里也看不见一个人，这倘使思嘉感到高兴些。她现在不想跟任何人谈话。<p>皮蒂姑妈家的新石板屋顶和红色砖墙，终于在前面出现了，这时思嘉的心也怦怦地跳起来。上帝多么仁慈啊，竟没有让这所房子损毁得不可收拾！彼得大叔正从前院走出来，胳膊上挎着一只采购的篮子，他瞧见思嘉和嬷嬷一跟艰难地走过来，黝黑的脸庞上漾开了一丝爽朗又不敢轻信似的微笑。思嘉暗暗想道，</p>"我要狠狠地吻这个老迈的黑傻瓜，我多么高兴看到他呀！”她随即快活地喊道：“彼得，快去把姑妈的眩晕药瓶子拿来，真的是我呀！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">That night the inevitable hominy and dried peas were on Aunt Pitty’s supper table and, as Scarlett ate them, she made a vow that these two dishes would never appear on her table when she had money again. And, no matter what price she had to pay, she was going to have money again, more than just enough to pay the taxes on Tara. Somehow, some day she was going to have plenty of money if she had to commit murder to get it.
<p>In the yellow lamplight of the dining room, she asked Pitty about her finances, hoping against hope that Charles’ family might be able to lend her the money she needed. The questions were none too subtle but Pitty, in her pleasure at having a member of the family to talk to, did not even notice the bald way the questions were put. She plunged with tears into the details of her misfortunes. She just didn’t know where her farms and town property and money had gone but everything had slipped away. At least, that was what Brother Henry told her. He hadn’t been able to pay the taxes on her estate. Everything except the house she was living in was gone and Pitty did not stop to think that the house had never been hers but was the joint property of Melanie and Scarlett. Brother Henry could just barely pay taxes on this house. He gave her a little something every month to live on and, though it was very humiliating to take money from him, she had to do it.</p></div>
  <div class="right">当天晚上，皮蒂姑妈家的晚餐上摆着不少了的玉米粥和干碗豆。思嘉一面吃一面暗暗发誓，一旦她又有了钱，便决不让这两样东西出现在她的餐桌上。而且，无论付出什么样的代价，她也要再捞些钱，比交纳塔拉的税金还要多的钱。总之，有一天她会捞到许多钱，即使杀人也在的所不惜。<p>在饭厅的暗淡灯光下，思嘉问皮蒂的经济状况怎样，她希望事情会出乎她的意料，查尔斯家能够借给她所需要的那笔钱。这个问题本来一点儿也不微妙，皮蒂正高兴有机会同一位亲戚谈话，对于提问题的这种方式并没有注意，她马上伤心地谈起自己所有的苦难来了。她连自己的农尝城里的财产和钱到哪里去了也不知道，只发现一切都失去了。至少享利兄弟是这样对她说的。他已经付不出她的地产税了。除了她现在住的这栋房子外，一切都已化为乌有，何况皮蒂还没有想到这所房子并不属她一人所有，而是与媚兰和思嘉的共同财产。享利兄弟仅仅能够交纳这所房子税金。他每月给一点点生活费。尽管要他的钱十分寒碜的。她也只好这样做了。</p></div></div>

  <div class="left">“Brother Henry says he doesn’t know how he’ll make ends meet with the load he’s carrying and the taxes so high but, of course, he’s probably lying and has loads of money and just won’t give me much.”
<p>Scarlett knew Uncle Henry wasn’t lying. The few letters she had had from him in connection with Charles’ property showed that. The old lawyer was battling valiantly to save the house and the one piece of downtown property where the warehouse had been, so Wade and Scarlett would have something left from the wreckage. Scarlett knew he was carrying these taxes for her at a great sacrifice.</p>“Of course, he hasn’t any money,” thought Scarlett grimly. “Well, check him and Aunt Pitty off my list. There’s nobody left but Rhett. I’ll have to do it. I must do it. But I mustn’t think about it now. ... I must get her to talking about Rhett so I can casually suggest to her to invite him to call tomorrow.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“享利兄弟说，他肩上的负担那么重，租税又那么高，他真不知怎样维持下去。不过，当然喽，他也许是在撒谎，而手头还有一大笔钱，只是不想多给我一点罢了。"<p>思嘉知道享利叔叔说的不是谎话。这从他写给她的几封谈查尔斯财产的信中可以看出，这位老律师在顽强奋斗要保住房子和城里原先仓库所在的那平地产，好让韦德和思嘉在破产之后还剩有一点东西，思嘉知道他正在冒很大的牺牲替她维持这些税金。</p>“当然，他没有什么钱了，"思嘉冷静地想。"好吧，把他和皮蒂姑妈从名单是划掉。现在除了瑞德，没有别的人了。我只好这么办。我必须这么办。不过，我现在用不着想它。………我得让她自己谈起瑞德，然后我再乘机提出叫她邀请他明天到这里来。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She smiled and squeezed the plump palms of Aunt Pitty between her own.
<p>“Darling Auntie,” she said, “don’t let’s talk about distressing things like money any more. Let’s forget about them and talk of pleasanter things. You must tell me all the news about our old friends. How is Mrs. Merriwether, and Maybelle? I heard that Maybelle’s little Creole came home safely. How are the Elsings and Dr. and Mrs. Meade?”</p>Pittypat brightened at the change of subject and her baby face stopped quivering with tears. She gave detailed reports about old neighbors, what they were doing and wearing and eating and thinking. She told with accents of horror how, before René Picard came home from the war, Mrs. Merriwether and Maybelle had made ends meet by baking pies and selling them to the Yankee soldiers. Imagine that! Sometimes there were two dozen Yankees standing in the back yard of the Merriwether home, waiting for the baking to be finished. Now that René was home, he drove an old wagon to the Yankee camp every day and sold cakes and pies and beaten biscuits to the soldiers. Mrs. Merriwether said that when she made a little more money she was going to open a bake shop downtown. Pitty did not wish to criticize but after all— As for herself, said Pitty, she would rather starve than have such commerce with Yankees. She made a point of giving a disdainful look to every soldier she met, and crossed to the other side of the street in as insulting a manner as possible, though, she said, this was quite inconvenient in wet weather. Scarlett gathered that no sacrifice, even though it be muddy shoes, was too great to show loyalty to the Confederacy, in so far as Miss Pittypat was concerned.
</div>
  <div class="right"><p>她满面笑容地紧紧握住皮蒂姑妈那双胖乎乎的手。</p>“好姑妈，"她说，"我们别再谈那些关于金钱什么的烦恼事了。让我们把这些事抛到脑后，谈些愉快的话题吧。你得告诉我每一桩关于老朋友们的新闻呀。梅里韦瑟太太怎么样了？还有梅贝尔呢？我听说梅贝尔的小克留尔安全返家了。可是埃尔辛家和米德大夫夫妇呢？“皮蒂帕特一转换话题就开颜了，她那张娃娃脸已不再在泪痕下伤心地抽搐。她一桩桩地报道老邻居的近况，他们在干什么、吃什么、穿什么、想什么。她用惊异的声调告诉思嘉，在雷内.卡德从战场上回来之前，梅里韦瑟太太和梅贝尔怎样靠做馅饼卖给北方佬大兵来维持自己的生活，想想那光景吧！有时候几十个北方佬站在梅里韦瑟家的后院里，等着母女俩把馅饼烤出来。现在雷内回来了，他每天赶着一辆旧货车到北方佬军营去卖蛋糕、馅和小面包。梅里韦瑟太太说，等到她再多赚点钱，她就要在城里开个面包铺。皮蒂并不想批评这种事，不过毕竟--至少她自己，皮蒂说，她是宁愿挨饿也不会跟北方佬做这种买卖的。她特别注意每次碰到大兵都要给他蔑神的脸色，并且走到街道的另一边去，以此来表示最大的蔑视，尽管这样做在雨天是很不方便的。思嘉看出，对于皮蒂特小姐来说，只要能表示对联盟政府的忠诚，无论什么样的牺牲，就算是两天弄脏一双鞋，都不是过分的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Mrs. Meade and the doctor had lost their home when the Yankees fired the town and they had neither the money nor the heart to rebuild, now that Phil and Darcy were dead. Mrs. Meade said she never wanted a home again, for what was a home without children and grandchildren in it? They were very lonely and had gone to live with the Elsings who had rebuilt the damaged part of their home. Mr. and Mrs. Whiting had a room there, too, and Mrs. Bonnell was talking of moving in, if she was fortunate enough to rent her house to a Yankee officer and his family.
<p>“But how do they all squeeze in?” cried Scarlett “There’s Mrs. Elsing and Fanny and Hugh—”</p>“Mrs. Elsing and Fanny sleep in the parlor and Hugh in the attic,” explained Pitty, who knew the domestic arrangements of all her friends. “My dear, I do hate to tell you this but—Mrs. Elsing calls them ‘paying guests’ but, Pitty dropped her voice, “they are really nothing at all except boarders. Mrs. Elsing is running a boarding “house! Isn’t that dreadful?”
</div>
  <div class="right">米德大夫夫妇的房屋是在北方佬放火烧城时毁掉的，后来费尔和达西相继牺牲，他们便既无钱也无心思来重建了。米德太太说她再也不想建立家庭，因为没有儿孙住在一起还算个什么家呢。他们感到十分孤独，只得去和埃尔辛一家住在一起，后者总算把自己房子的损坏地方修复了。惠廷夫妇也在那里占有一个房间，如果邦内尔太太能幸运地把自己的房子租给一个北方佬军官和他一家去住，那么她也有意要搬进去。<p>“可是，他们这么多人怎么挤得下呀？"思嘉大声问。"有埃尔辛太太，有范妮，还有休--"</p>埃尔辛太太和范妮住在厅里，休住在阁楼上，"皮蒂解释说，她是了解所有朋友们的家务安排的。"亲爱的，我本不想告诉你这些事，可是--埃尔辛太太称他们为'房客'，可是，"皮蒂压低声音，"他们真是地地道道的寄宿者埃埃尔辛太太就是在开旅店嘛！你说可怕不可怕？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I think it’s wonderful,” said Scarlett shortly. “I only wish we’d had ‘paying guests’ at Tara for the last year instead of free boarders. Maybe we wouldn’t be so poor now.”
<p>“Scarlett, how can you say such things? Your poor mother must be turning in her grave at the very thought of charging money for the hospitality of Tara! Of course, Mrs. Elsing was simply forced to it because, while she took in fine sewing and Fanny painted china and Hugh made a little money peddling firewood, they couldn’t make ends meet. Imagine darling Hugh forced to peddle wood! And he all set to be a fine lawyer! I could just cry at the things our boys are reduced to!”</p>Scarlett thought of the rows of cotton beneath the glaring coppery sky at Tara and how her back had ached as she bent over them. She remembered the feel of plow handles between her inexperienced, blistered palms and she felt that Hugh Elsing was deserving of no special sympathy. What an innocent old fool Pitty was and, despite the ruin all around her, how sheltered!
</div>
  <div class="right">“我想这是了不起的。"思嘉冷冷地说，"我倒宁愿去年在塔拉有这样一批房客，而不是免费寄宿。要是这样，我们现在也不会这样穷了。"<p>“思嘉，你怎么能说出这种话来？你母亲在坟墓里连想起要向在塔拉接待的亲友们收费，也会感到不安的！当然，埃尔辛太太这样做也纯粹是迫不得已的，因为单靠她揽点缝纫活，范妮画瓷器，休叫卖柴火，是维持不了生活的。想想看吧，小小的休竟卖起柴火来了！而他原来是一心要当个出色的律师的。眼看着我们的孩子竟落到这个地步，我真想哭呢。"</p>思嘉想起塔拉像铜钱般闪耀的天空下那一行行的棉花和她弓着身子侍弄它们时那种腰酸背痛的感觉。她想起自己用一双毫无经验的、满是血泡的手扶着犁把时的滋味。她觉得休.埃尔辛也并不是特别值得同情的。皮蒂是个多么天真的老傻瓜呀，而且，尽管是一片废墟，她还过得真不错呢！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“If he doesn’t like peddling, why doesn’t He practice law? Or isn’t there any law practice left in Atlanta?”
<p>“Oh dear, yes! There’s plenty of law practice. Practically everybody is suing everybody else these days. With everything burned down and boundary lines wiped out, no one knows just where their land begins or ends. But you can’t get any pay for suing because nobody has any money. So Hugh sticks to his peddling. ... Oh, I almost forgot! Did I write you? Fanny Elsing is getting married tomorrow night and, of course, you must attend. Mrs. Elsing will be only too pleased to have you when she knows you’re in town. I do hope you have some other frock besides that one. Not that it isn’t a very sweet frock, darling, but—well, it does look a bit worn. Oh, you have a pretty frock? I’m so glad because it’s going to be the first real wedding we’ve had in Atlanta since before the town fell. Cake and wine and dancing afterward, though I don’t know how the Elsings can afford it, they are so poor.”</p>“Who is Fanny marrying? I thought after Dallas McLure was killed at Gettysburg—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“要是他不高兴卖柴火，干吗不当律师呢？难道在亚特兰大就不需要律师了吗？"<p>“啊，亲爱的，不是这样！律师的事还多着呢。这些日子，实际上每个人都在控告别人。由于什么都烧光了，界线也消失了，谁也说不清自己的地界在哪里。因为大家都没有钱了。所以你要打官司也打不起。因此休只好一心一意卖自己的柴火。……啊，我差点忘了！我写信告诉了你了吗？范妮.埃尔辛明天晚上要结婚了。当然，你应该参加婚礼。埃尔辛太太只要知道你到了城里，一定很欢迎你去。我真希望你除了这身穿着还另外有件衣服。并不是说这一件不好看，亲爱的，可是--嗯，它显得有点旧了。啊，你有件漂亮的长袍？我真高兴，这将是亚特兰大沦陷以来头一次举行的真正的婚礼呢。婚礼上将有蛋糕，有酒，然后是舞会，尽管我不明白埃尔辛家怎么花得起，因为他们本来是够穷的。"</p>“范妮嫁给谁呀？我想达拉斯.麦克卢尔在葛底堡牺牲之后--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Darling, you mustn’t criticize Fanny. Everybody isn’t as loyal to the dead as you are to poor Charlie. Let me see. What is his name? I can never remember names—Tom somebody. I knew his mother well, we went to La-Grange Female Institute together. She was a Tomlinson from LaGrange and her mother was—let me see. ... Perkins? Parkins? Parkinson! That’s it. From Sparta. A very good family but just the same—well, I know I shouldn’t say it but I don’t see how Fanny can bring herself to marry him!”
<p>“Does he drink or—”</p>“Dear, no! His character is perfect but, you see, he was wounded low down, by a bursting shell and it did something to his legs—makes them—makes them, well, I hate to use the word but it makes him spraddle. It gives him a very vulgar appearance when he walks—well, it doesn’t look very pretty. I don’t see why she’s marrying him.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“乖乖，你不应该批评范妮。不是每个人都像你对查尔斯那样忠于死者呀。让我想想，他叫什么名字来着？我总是记不住名字--也许叫汤姆什么的。我和他母亲很熟，曾经一起上过拉格兰奇女子学院。她姓托姆林森，是拉格兰奇人，而她母亲是--让我想想。……姓珀金斯，珀金斯？珀金森！对了。斯巴达人。门第很好，可还是一样--嗯，我知道本来不该说的，可不明白范妮怎么愿意去嫁给他的！"<p>“他喝酒？还是--"</p>“不，亲爱的。他的个性完美无缺，不过你瞧，他下身受了伤，被一颗开花弹打的，打坏了两腿--把它们--把它们，唉，我很讨厌用那个字眼，总之他只能叉开两腿走路了。因此他行走起来非常难看--嗯，可真不体面呢。我不明白她为什么要嫁给他。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Girls have to marry someone.”
<p>“Indeed, they do not,” said Pitty, ruffling. “I never had to.”</p>“Now, darling, I didn’t mean you! Everybody knows how popular you were and still are! Why, old Judge Carlton used to throw sheep’s eyes at you till I—”
<p>“Oh, Scarlett, hush! That old fool!” giggled Pitty, good humor restored. “But, after all, Fanny was so popular she could have made a better match and I don’t believe she loves this Tom what’s-his-name. I don’t believe she’s ever gotten over Dallas McLure getting killed, but she’s not like you, darling. You’ve remained so faithful to dear Charlie, though you could have married dozens of times. Melly and I have often said how loyal you were to his memory when everyone else said you were just a heartless coquette.”</p>Scarlett passed over this tactless confidence and skillfully led Pitty from one friend to another but all the while she was in a fever of impatience to bring the conversation around to Rhett. It would never do for her to ask outright about him, so soon after arriving. It might start the old lady’s mind to working on channels better left untouched. There would be time enough for Pitty’s suspicions to be aroused if Rhett refused to marry her.
</div>
  <div class="right">“姑娘们总得嫁人嘛！"<p>“说真的，那倒不一定。"皮蒂皱皱眉头，表示异议。“我就从没想过。”</p>“你看，亲爱的，我不是说你呀！谁都知道你多么惹人爱慕，而且至今还是这样。要不，老法官卡尔顿还常常向你飞媚眼呢，以致我--"<p>“唔，思嘉，别说了！那个老傻瓜！"皮蒂格格地笑着，情绪又好起来。"不过，无论怎么说，范妮是那样可爱，她本该嫁一个更好的人，而且我就不信她真的爱上这个汤什姆什么的。我不信她忘了达拉斯.麦克卢尔。不过她跟你不一样，亲爱的，你对心爱的查理至今忠贞不渝，要是你想再嫁，可能又嫁过多次了。媚兰和我时常谈起你为查理守节多么坚贞，虽然别人在背地里议论你，说你简直是个没心肝的风流女子。"</p>思嘉对于这种不高明的恭维漠然置之，只一心要诱导皮蒂从一个朋友谈到另一个朋友，而且始终迫不及待地将谈话绕到瑞德身上。她决不会直截了当问起他的，何况自己刚到这里。而且那样做可能会引起老太太琢磨一些最好不去触动的想法。要是瑞德拒绝娶她，不愁没有机会惹起皮蒂对她的猜疑呢！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Aunt Pitty prattled on happily, pleased as a child at having an audience. Things in Atlanta were in a dreadful pass, she said, due to the vile doings of the Republicans. There was no end to their goings on and the worst thing was the way they were putting ideas in the poor darkies’ heads.
<p>“My dear, they want to let the darkies vote! Did you ever hear of anything more silly? Though—I don’t know—now that I think about it, Uncle Peter has much more sense than any Republican I ever saw and much better manners but, of course, Uncle Peter is far too well bred to want to vote. But the very notion has upset the darkies till they’re right addled. And some of them are so insolent. Your life isn’t safe on the streets after dark and even in the broad daylight they push ladies off the sidewalks into the mud. And if any gentleman dares to protest, they arrest him and— My dear, did I tell you that Captain Butler was in jail?”</p>“Rhett Butler?”
</div>
  <div class="right">皮蒂姑妈很高兴喋喋不休地说下去，就像一个孩子好不容易获得了自己的听众似的。她说在亚特兰大，因为共和党人做了许多缺德事，目前的局面是可怕的。况且这一趋势没有尽头，其中最糟糕的是他们向穷黑人头脑里灌输思想的那种方式。<p>“亲爱的，他们要让黑人投票选举呢！你说世界上还有比这更荒谬的事吗？尽管--我不明白--反正我这样想，彼得大叔比任何一个共和党人都更加清醒，也更有礼貌，不过，当然喽，像彼得大叔这样有教养的人是不会参加选举的。可是，光这种想法本身就把黑人搞得简直昏昏然了。何况他们中间有些人是那么粗野无礼。天黑以后你在大街上走路是有生命危险的，甚至大白天他们也会把姑娘们推掇到路边的泥洼里去。而且，如果有位绅士胆敢表示抗议，他们就逮捕他，以致--亲爱的，我告诉过你没有？巴特船长已经进监狱了。"</p>"瑞德.巴特勒？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Even with this startling news, Scarlett was grateful that Aunt Pitty had saved her the necessity of bringing his name into the conversation herself.
<p>“Yes, indeed!” Excitement colored Pitty’s cheeks pink and she sat upright. “He’s in jail this very minute for killing a negro and they may hang him! Imagine Captain Butler hanging!”</p>For a moment, the breath went out of Scarlett’s lungs in a sickening gasp and she could only stare at the fat old lady who was so obviously pleased at the effect of her statement.
</div>
  <div class="right">即使是这么个消息，思嘉也要感激不尽，因为皮蒂使她无需亲自提到巴特勒的名字就谈起他来了。<p>“是的，千真万确！"皮蒂已兴奋得两颊发红，腰也挺得笔直了。"他就是因为杀了一个黑人立即被抓起来的。说不定要判处绞刑呢！想想吧，巴特勒船长要被判处绞刑！"</p>思嘉顿时像个泄了气的皮球，喘不过起来了，只是呆呆地盯着这位胖老太太，老太太却因自己讲的事产生了效果而洋洋自得。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“They haven’t proved it yet but somebody killed this darky who had insulted a white woman. And the Yankees are very upset because so many uppity darkies have been killed recently. They can’t prove it on Captain Butler but they want to make an example of someone, so Dr. Meade says. The doctor says that if they do hang him it will be the first good honest job the Yankees ever did, but then, I don’t know. ... And to think that Captain Butler was here just a week ago and brought me the loveliest quail you ever saw for a present and he was asking about you and saying he feared he had offended you during the siege and you would never forgive him.”</div>
  <div class="right">“他们还没有找到充分的证据，不过的确有人杀了这个侮辱白人妇女的黑鬼。北方佬感到十分恼火，因为最近有那么多气势汹汹的黑人被杀了。他们在巴特勒船长身上找不到任何证据，可是正如--米德大夫说的，他们总得搞出一个样板。大夫认为如果他们真把他绞死，也是北方佬的第一桩大好事，不过那样一来，我就想不通。……想想看，巴特勒船长上星期还到过里，给我带来了一只怪可爱的鹌鹑当礼物呢。他还问起你，说他担心围城期间得罪过你，你大概永远也不会原谅他的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“How long will he be in jail?”
<p>“Nobody knows. Perhaps till they hang him, but maybe they won’t be able to prove the killing on him, after all. However, it doesn’t seem to bother the Yankees whether folks are guilty or not, so long as they can hang somebody. They are so upset”—Pitty dropped her voice mysteriously—“about the Ku Klux Klan. Do you have the Klan down in the County? My dear, I’m sure you must and Ashley just doesn’t tell you girls anything about it Klansmen aren’t supposed to tell. They ride around at night dressed up like ghosts and call on Carpetbaggers who steal money and negroes who are uppity. Sometimes they just scare them and warn them to leave Atlanta, but when they don’t behave they whip them and,” Pitty whispered, “sometimes they kill them and leave them where they’ll be easily found with the Ku Klux card on them. ... And the Yankees are very angry about it and want to make an example of someone. ... But Hugh Elsing told me he didn’t think they’d hang Captain Butler because the Yankees think he does know where the money is and just won’t tell. They are trying to make him tell.”</p>“The money?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“他得在监狱里呆多久？"<p>“谁知道呢。也许一直要关到执行绞刑那天吧。不过，也可能他们最终落实不了他的杀人证据。当然喽，对于北方佬来说，只要能抓住一个人判绞刑就行了。至于究竟谁有罪谁没罪，那是用不着操心的。他们愤怒极了"--皮蒂神秘地压低声音--"至于那个三Ｋ党，在你们乡下也有吧？亲爱的，我相信一定有的，只不过艾希礼不会把这种事告诉你们姑娘家罢了。三Ｋ党人是不许谈这个的，他们在晚上装扮得像魔鬼似的，骑着马四处转悠，寻找偷钱的提包党人和盛气凌人的黑鬼。有时三Ｋ党只吓唬吓唬他们。警告他们快离开亚特兰大，可是如果他们不服从就动手用鞭子抽，并且，"皮蒂悄悄地说，"有时把他们杀掉，扔到很容易发现的地方，上面还着三Ｋ党的名片呢。……所以北方佬非常气恼，想来个杀一儆百。……不过休.埃尔辛告诉我，他认为他们不至于绞死巴特勒船长，因为北方佬觉得他知道那笔钱的下落，只是不说罢了。他们正想办法让他说出来。"</p>“那笔钱？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Didn’t you know? Didn’t I write you? My dear, you have been buried at Tara, haven’t you? The town simply buzzed when Captain Butler came back here with a fine horse and carriage and his pockets full of money, when all the rest of us didn’t know where our next meal was coming from. It simply made everybody furious that an old speculator who always said nasty things about the Confederacy should have so much money when we were all so poor. Everybody was bursting to know how he managed to save his money but no one had the courage to ask him—except me and he just laughed and said: ‘In no honest way, you may be sure.’ You know how hard it is to get anything sensible out of him.”
<p>“But of course, he made his money out of the blockade—”</p>“Of course, he did, honey, some of it. But that’s not a drop in the bucket to what that man has really got. Everybody, including the Yankees, believes he’s got millions of dollars in gold belonging to the Confederate government hid out somewhere.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你还不知道吗？我不是写信告诉你了吗？亲爱的，你是给埋在塔拉了，不是吗，巴勒特船长回来时城里简直都轰动了，他驾着漂亮的马车，口袋里装满了钞票，可我们大家正愁着下顿饭没米下锅呢！这真叫每个人都气炸了，一个惯常说联盟政府脏话的老投机商竟有这么多的钱，而我们大家都穷得要命。每个人都急切地要知道他是怎样赚这--么多钱的，可是谁也没勇气去问他--就我敢问，而他只笑着说：'不是老老实实挣的，你放心好了。'你看要从他嘴里掏点正经的东西多不容易呀！"<p>“不过，当然啦，他的钱是跑封锁线捞到的--"</p>“当然，是这样，宝贝，有一部分是的。不过，跟他实实在在拥有的那笔钱比起来，这只是缸里的一滴水。每个人，包括北方佬在内，都相信他找到了藏在某个地方，属于联盟政府所有的成百万的金元。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Millions—in gold?”
<p>“Well, honey, where did all our Confederate gold go to? Somebody got it and Captain Butler must be one of the somebodies. The Yankees thought President Davis had it when he left Richmond but when they captured the poor man he had hardly a cent. There just wasn’t any money in the treasury when the war was over and everybody thinks some of the blockade runners got it and are keeping quiet about it.”</p>“Millions—in gold! But how—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“成百万的--金元？"<p>“嗯，宝贝，你说我们联盟政府的黄金到哪里去了呢？到了某些人的手里，而巴特勒可能就是这某些人中的一个。北方佬以为是戴维斯总统离开里士满时携带着这批金元，但等他们逮捕这个穷老头子时，才发现他原来身无分文。战争结束时国库是没有钱的，所以大家认为是有些跑封锁线的商人拿到了这笔钱，他们现在闭口不谈了。"</p>“成百万的--金元？可怎么-—"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Didn’t Captain Butler take thousands of bales of cotton to England and Nassau to sell for the Confederate government?” asked Pitty triumphantly. “Not only his own cotton but government cotton too? And you know what cotton brought in England during the war! Any price you wanted to ask! He was a free agent acting for the government and he was supposed to sell the cotton and buy guns with the money and run the guns in for us. Well, when the blockade got too tight, he couldn’t bring in the guns and he couldn’t have spent one one-hundredth of the cotton money on them anyway, so there were simply millions of dollars in English banks put there by Captain Butler and other blockaders, waiting till the blockade loosened. And you can’t tell me they banked that money in the name of the Confederacy. They put it in their own names and it’s still there. ... Everybody has been talking about it ever since the surrender and criticizing the blockaders severely, and when the Yankees arrested Captain Butler for killing this darky they must have heard the rumor, because they’ve been at him to tell them where the money is. You see, all of our Confederate funds belong to the Yankees now—at least, the Yankees think so. But Captain Butler says he doesn’t know anything. ... Dr. Meade says they ought to hang him anyhow, only hanging is too good for a thief and a profiteer— Dear, you look so oddly! Do you feel faint? Have I upset you talking like this? I knew he was once a beau of yours but I thought you’d fallen out long ago. Personally, I never approved of him, for he’s such a scamp—”</div>
  <div class="right">“巴特勒船长不是给联盟政府运过好几千包棉花到英国和纳索去卖了吗？"皮蒂得意地说。"不只是他自己的棉花，还有政府的棉花呢！而且你知道，战时把棉花运进英国是怎么回事。你要价多少就是多少呀！他是一个为政府办事的自由经纪人，为的是卖出棉花，然后用这笔钱给我们买进军火。好，当封锁线愈来愈紧缩时，他就没法把军火运进来了。这时他当然不可能将全部棉花用于军火，于是便有了成百万的钱由巴特勒和其他跑封锁线的商人存在英国银行里，等候放松封锁时再使用。而且很难说他们存钱时是用的联盟政府的名义。他们把钱存在自己名下，而且至今还在那里呢。……自从宣布投降以来，人人都在议论和狠狠批评那帮跑封锁线的家伙，而北方佬以杀害黑人的罪名逮捕巴特勒船长时，一定已经听到这种传闻，因为他们已经在逼迫他将钱的下落告诉他们了。你看，我们联盟政府的全部资金现在通通归北方佬所有了--至少北方佬是这样想的。可是巴特勒船长声称他什么也不知道。……米德大夫说他们还是应当把他绞死，只不过绞刑太便宜这个窃贼和投机商了--亲爱的，你怎么了，怎么这副样子！你有点头晕？我谈这些叫你厌烦吗？我知道他曾经是你的一位求爱者，可是我以为你早已把他忘到一边了呢。就人品而论，我从没喜欢过他，这么个无赖汉--"</div></div>

  <div class="left">“He’s no friend of mine,” said Scarlett with an effort. “I had a quarrel with him during the siege, after you went to Macon. Where—where is he?”
<p>“In the firehouse over near the public square!”</p>“In the firehouse?”
<p>Aunt Pitty crowed with laughter.</p>“Yes, he’s in the firehouse. The Yankees use it for a military jail now. The Yankees are camped in huts all round the city hall in the square and the firehouse is just down the street, so that’s where Captain Butler is. And Scarlett, I heard the funniest thing yesterday about Captain Butler. I forget who told me. You know how well groomed he always was—really a dandy—and they’ve been keeping him in the firehouse and not letting him bathe and every day he’s been insisting that he wanted a bath and finally they led him out of his cell onto the square and there was a long, horse trough where the whole regiment had bathed in the same water! And they told him he could bathe there and he said No, that he preferred his own brand of Southern dirt to Yankee dirt and—”

  <div class="right">“他不能算是你的朋友，"思嘉认真地说。"围城期间，你到梅肯去了以后，我跟他吵了一架，可如今他在哪里？"<p>“就在那边公共广场附近的消防站呢！"</p>“在消防站？"<p>“皮蒂姑妈格格地笑起来。</p>“是呀，他关在消防站。现在北方佬把那里当作一间军事监狱了。北方佬驻扎在广场市政厅周围的营房里，而消防站就在附近街上。所以巴特勒也关在那里，我说，思嘉，昨天我听到关于巴特勒船长的一桩最有趣的事。我忘记了是谁跟我讲的。你知道他这个人总是那么爱修饰--一个地地道道的花花公子--而他们把拘留在消防站里，不让他洗澡，他坚持一定要每天洗一次澡，最后他们只好把他从那个面对广场的小间里放出来，广场上有个长长饮马槽，所有人都在同一盆水里洗澡呢。他们告诉他可以在那里洗，他说，不，说他宁肯保留自己南方人的污垢，而决不沾上北方佬的污垢--"</div></div>

  <div class="left">Scarlett heard the cheerful babbling voice going on and on but she did not hear the words. In her mind there were only two ideas, Rhett had more money than she had even hoped and he was in jail. The fact that he was in jail and possibly might be hanged changed the face of matters somewhat, in fact made them look a little brighter. She had very little feeling about Rhett being hanged. Her need of money was too pressing, too desperate, for her to bother about his ultimate fate. Besides, she half shared Dr. Meade’s opinion that hanging was too good for him. Any man who’d leave a woman stranded between two armies in the middle of the night, just to go off and fight for a Cause already lost, deserved hanging. ... If she could somehow manage to marry him while he was in jail, all those millions would be hers and hers alone should he be executed. And if marriage was not possible, perhaps she could get a loan from him by promising to marry him when he was released or by promising—oh, promising anything! And if they hanged him, her day of settlement would never come.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉见她兴致致勃勃，喋喋不休地唠叨，可是她一句话也没听进去。她心里只有两个念头：瑞德拥有比她所想像的多得多的钱，他现在蹲在监狱里。他关在监狱里并且可能被判处绞刑这一点多少改变了事情的面貌，事实上是使事情显得稍稍明朗了一些。她没去想到瑞德要被判处绞刑。她对钱的需要太迫切，太紧急，以致没有功夫去为他的最终命运操心了。此外，她也部分同意米德大夫的意见，判绞刑太便宜他了。对于一个男人，不惜在两军对垒之际，深更半夜把一个女人扔下不管，只是为了投入一桩早已失败的事业而战斗，这样的人被绞死是活该的。……要是在他蹲监狱时她能设法跟他结婚，要是他随后被处决，那么，那成百万的金元就都是她的，都是她一个人的了。要是不能结婚呢，那么，或者她只要答应在他获释后嫁给他，或者答应--啊，管它什么都行！--她便能从他那里拿到一笔贷款。再说，如果他们把他绞死，她就永远不用偿还了。</div></div>

  <div class="left">For a moment her imagination flamed at the thought of being made a widow by the kindly intervention of the Yankee government. Millions in gold! She could repair Tara and hire hands and plant miles and miles of cotton. And she could have pretty clothes and all she wanted to eat and so could Suellen and Carreen. And Wade could have nourishing food to fill out his thin cheeks and warm clothes and a governess and afterward go to the university ... and not grow up barefooted and ignorant like a Cracker. And a good doctor could look after Pa and as for Ashley—what couldn’t she do for Ashley!
<p>Aunt Pittypat’s monologue broke off suddenly as she said inquiringly: “Yes, Mammy?” and Scarlett, coming back from dreams, saw Mammy standing in the doorway, her hands under her apron and in her eyes an alert piercing look. She wondered how long Mammy had been standing there and how much she had heard and observed. Probably everything, to judge by the gleam in her old eyes.</p>“Miss Scarlett look lak she tared. Ah spec she better go ter bed.”

  <div class="right">一想北方佬政府的好意干预下她要成为寡妇，她的想像力便顿时燃烧起来，成百万的金元呢！她能够把塔拉修复好，雇些工人种植许多英亩的棉花。她能购买许多漂亮衣服，能吃想吃的一切，还有苏伦和卡琳也是这样。韦德会有足够的营养品反他那瘦弱的身子吃得胖胖的，衣服穿得暖暖的，还要雇家庭教师，以后上大学。……再不会光着脚长大成人，成为一个像山区穷汉那样的笨蛋。那时也能雇一位医生照料爸爸了。至于艾希礼--她还有什么不能替他做呢？<p>皮蒂姑妈的独脚戏突然中断了，这时她用探询的口气说：“怎么啦，思嘉？”思嘉猛地从梦想中醒过来，看见嬷嬷站在门道里，两手藏在围裙底下，眼里流露着机警逼人的神色她不知道嬷嬷站在那里多久了，听到和观察到多少东西。从她那双老眼里的光辉看来，说不定一切明白了呢。</p>“思嘉姑娘好像是累了。我说她最好去睡吧。"</div></div>

  <div class="left">“I am tired,” said Scarlett, rising and meeting Mammy’s eyes with a childlike, helpless look, “and I’m afraid I’m catching a cold too. Aunt Pitty, would you mind if I stayed in bed tomorrow and didn’t go calling with you? I can go calling any time and I’m so anxious to go to Fanny’s wedding tomorrow night. And if my cold gets worse I won’t be able to go. And a day in bed would be such a lovely treat for me.”
<p>Mammy’s look changed to faint worry as she felt Scarlett’s hands and looked into her face. She certainly didn’t look well. The excitement of her thoughts had abruptly ebbed, leaving her white and shaking.</p>“Yo’ han’s lak ice, honey. You come ter bed an’ Ah’ll brew you some sassfrass tea an’ git you a hot brick ter mek you sweat.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我有点累了。"思嘉说，一面站起身来，用孩子般无可奈何的表情望着嬷嬷的眼睛，"我恐怕还受了点凉呢。皮蒂姑妈，万一我明天要躺着休息一天，不跟你去探望邻居，你不会介意吧？我什么时候都可以去看望他们，尤其想去参加明晚范妮的婚礼。但如果我的感冒加重，就不能去了。躺着休息，一天便是给我的最好不过的治疗了。"<p>嬷嬷摸了摸思嘉的手，看了看她的脸色，显得有点着急。她准是神色不怎么好。她昂奋的思绪突然低落下去，她的脸色苍白，身子微微颤抖。</p>“你的两手冷冰冰的，乖乖，你快去躺下，我给你熬点黄樟茶，烧块热砖拿来，好让你发发汗。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“How thoughtless I’ve been,” cried the plump old lady, hopping from her chair and patting Scarlett’s arm. “Just chattering on and not thinking of you. Honey, you shall stay in bed all tomorrow and rest up and we can gossip together— Oh, dear, no! I can’t be with you. I’ve promised to sit with Mrs. Bonnell tomorrow. She is down with la grippe and so is her cook. Mammy, I’m so glad you are here. You must go over with me in the morning and help me.”
<p>Mammy hurried Scarlett up the dark stairs, muttering fussy remarks about cold hands and thin shoes and Scarlett looked meek and was well content. If she could only lull Mammy’s suspicions further and get her out of the house in the morning, all would be well. Then she could go to the Yankee jail and see Rhett. As she climbed the stairs, the faint rumbling of thunder began and, standing on the well-remembered landing, she thought how like the siege cannon it sounded. She shivered. Forever, thunder would mean cannon and war to her.</p>

  <div class="right">“我多么大意呀，"胖老太太嚷道，立刻从椅子上站起，拍拍思嘉的肩膀，"我一直唠叨个没完，根本没管你。宝贝，明天你一天躺着休息，我陪你闲聊--啊，亲爱的，不行！我不能陪你了。我已答应明天去陪邦内尔太太呢。她在患流行性感冒，她家的厨子也病倒了。嬷嬷，我真高兴你能在这里。明天早上你得同我一起过去，给我帮忙呀。"<p>嬷嬷催促思嘉爬上黑暗的楼梯，一面喃喃地抱怨手凉啦，衣服太单薄啦，等等，这时思嘉倒显得温顺和心满意足了。要是她能够进而消除嬷嬷的猜疑并让她明天不呆在家里，那就太好了。那时她就能到北方佬监狱里去探望瑞德了。她在爬楼梯时隐约听到隆隆的雷声，于是她站在那熟悉的楼顶走廊上思量着这声音多么像围城期间的炮声。她浑身颤抖。从那以后，她总是一听到雷声便连想起大炮和战争来了。</p></div></div>
