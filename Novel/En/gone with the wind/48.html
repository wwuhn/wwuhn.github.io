  Honeymoon in New Orleans</div> <div class="right3"></div>  </div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">SHE DID HAVE FUN, more fun than she had had since the spring before the war. New Orleans was such a strange, glamorous place and Scarlett enjoyed it with the headlong pleasure of a pardoned life prisoner. The Carpetbaggers were looting the town, many honest folk were driven from their homes and did not know where to look for their next meal, and a negro sat in the lieutenant governor’s chair. But the New Orleans Rhett showed her was the gayest place she had ever seen. The people she met seemed to have all the money they wanted and no cares at all. Rhett introduced her to dozens of women, pretty women in bright gowns, women who had soft hands that showed no signs of hard work, women who laughed at everything and never talked of stupid serious things or hard times. And the men she met—how thrilling they were! And how dif-ferent from Atlanta men—and how they fought to dance with her, and paid her the most extravagant compliments as though she were a young belle.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉在新奥尔良的确过得非常愉快，从战前最后一个春天到现在，她从来没有感到这样愉快过。新奥尔良是一个奇异的热闹地方，思嘉就像一个判了无期徒刑的囚犯突然获释一样，玩得痛快极了。北方来的冒险家在城里大肆掠夺，许多诚实的人流落街头，还不知下一顿饭到哪里去找。一个黑人占据着副州长的位置。不过瑞德在新奥尔良带她去的地方，是她从未见过的繁华地区。她所见到的人，看上去都有的是钱，瑞德介绍她认识了十几位妇女，她们长得很漂亮，穿着漂亮鲜艳的袍子，两手细嫩，不像干过重活的样子，遇见什么事都要笑，从来不谈无聊的正经事，也不谈艰难困苦的日子，她见到的男人--他们与亚特兰大的男人实在不同，多么令人兴奋呀！都争着和她跳舞，不遗余力地向她大献殷勤，好像她是舞会上的年轻皇后一样。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">These men had the same hard reckless look Rhett wore. Their eyes were always alert, like men who have lived too long with danger to be ever quite careless. They seemed to have no pasts or futures, and they politely discouraged Scarlett when, to make conversation, she asked what or where they were before they came to New Orleans. That, in itself, was strange, for in Atlanta every respectable newcomer hastened to present his credentials, to tell proudly of his home and family, to trace the tortuous mazes of relationship that stretched over the entire South.</div>
  <div class="right">这些男人和瑞德一样，脸上都带着固执、鲁莽的神情。他们的眼睛始终很机警，好像很久以来一直生活在危险之中，不敢有一点疏忽大意。他们似乎无所谓过去，也没有未来。思嘉有时想找个话题，就问来新奥尔良之前他们是干什么的，或在什么地方，他们总是客平地把话题岔开。这本身就很奇怪，因为在亚特兰大，任何一个新来的体面人都急于把自己的经历向大家进述，炫耀一下自己显赫的家庭。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But these men were a taciturn lot, picking their words carefully. Sometimes when Rhett was alone with them and Scarlett in the next room, she heard laughter and caught fragments of conversation that meant nothing to her, scraps of words, puzzling names—Cuba and Nassau in the blockade days, the gold rush and claim jumping, gun running and filibustering, Nicaragua and William Walker and how he died against a wall at Truxillo. Once her sudden entrance abruptly terminated a conversation about what had happened to the members of Quantrill’s band of guerillas, and she caught the names of Frank and Jesse James.</div>
  <div class="right">但是这些人都是沉默寡言的人，说起话来字斟句酌，非常谨慎。有时瑞备单独和他们在一起，思嘉在隔壁就听见他们的笑声，还断断续续听见他们的谈话，但她却听不明白，只能听出零零碎碎的几个字，还有一些莫名其妙的名字，其中有封锁时期的古巴和纳索，淘金热，非法侵占他人的采矿权，走私军火，海盗行为，尼加拉瓜和威廉.沃克，以及他如何在特鲁希略撞墙而死。有一次，她突然走进去，他们正在谈论匡特利尔领导的游击队最近遭遇如何，见她进来，便连忙住口，她只听见两个人名字：弗兰克.詹姆斯和杰西.詹姆斯。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But they were all well mannered, beautifully tailored, and they evidently admired her, so it mattered little to Scarlett that they chose to live utterly in the present. What really mattered was that they were Rhett’s friends and had large houses and fine carriages, and they took her and Rhett driving, invited them to suppers, gave parties in their honor. And Scarlett liked them very well. Rhett was amused when she told him so.
<p>“I thought you would,” he said and laughed.</p>“Why not?” her suspicions aroused as always by his laughter.
<p>“They’re all second-raters, black sheep, rascals. They’re all adventurers or Carpetbag aristocrats. They all made their money speculating in food like your loving husband or out of dubious government contracts or in shady ways that won’t bear investigation.”</p>“I don’t believe it You’re teasing. They’re the nicest people ...”
</div>
  <div class="right">不过他们都衣着考究，文质彬彬，显然对她十殷勤，而她觉得无所谓。对她来说，真正重要的是他们都是瑞德的朋友，有宽敞的住房，有华丽的马车。他们带着她和瑞德去兜风，请他们吃晚饭，为他们举行晚会，思嘉觉得开心极了。她把自己的这种心情告诉瑞德时，瑞德觉得很有意思。<p>“我想你是会这样的，"他一面说，一面笑。</p>“为什么不这样呢？"她和往常一样，一听见他笑，就起疑心。<p>“他们都是二流人物，是流氓，是恶棍。他们都是冒险家，北方来的贵族老爷，他们有的和你那亲爱的丈夫一样，做食品投机生意发了财，有的靠和政府签订非法合同或通过经不起调查的肮脏手段发了财。"</p>“我才不信呢！你在开玩笑吧。他们看上去都是老实人……"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“The nicest people in town are starving,” said Rhett. “And living politely in hovels, and I doubt if I’d be received in those hovels. You see, my dear, I was engaged in some of my nefarious schemes here during the war and these people have devilish long memories! Scarlett, you are a constant joy to me. You unerringly manage to pick the wrong people and the wrong things.”
<p>“But they are your friends!”</p>“Oh, but I like rascals. My early youth was spent as a gambler on a river boat and I can understand people like that. But I’m not blind to what they are. Whereas you”— he laughed again—“you have no instinct about people, no discrimination between the cheap and the great. Sometimes, I think that the only great ladies you’ve ever associated with were your mother and Miss Melly and neither seems to have made any impression on you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“城里老实的人都在挨饿呢，"瑞德说。"他们规规矩矩地住在茅草棚里，要是我去看他们，我真怀疑他们会不会接待我。亲爱的，你知道战争期间我在这里干过一些见不得人的勾当，这些人记性特别好，还没有把我忘掉。思嘉，你每时每刻使我感到高兴。因为你总是喜欢那些不该喜欢的人，不该喜欢的事。"<p>“可是他们都是你的朋友啊！"</p>“唔，不过我喜欢流氓。我小时候就在内河一条船上赌博过，所以我对这样的人是比较了解的。可是，他们究竟是些什么人，我是看得很清楚的。然而你--"他又笑了起来，"你是没有识别人的本能的，下等人，上等人，你是分辩不清的。有时候我觉得你接触过的上等人只有你母亲和媚兰小姐，可是她们好像都没给你留下什么印象。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>“Melly! Why she’s as plain as an old shoe and her clothes always look tacky and she never has two words to say for herself!”</p>“Spare me your jealousy, Madam. Beauty doesn’t make a lady, nor clothes a great lady!”
<p>“Oh, don’t they! Just you wait, Rhett Butler, and I’ll show you. Now that I’ve—we’ve got money, I’m going to be the greatest lady you ever saw!”</p>“I shall wait with interest,” he said.
</div>
  <div class="right"><p>“媚兰！哎，她难看得要命，穿的衣裳也那么俗气，而且自己也说不出有什么看法。"</p><p>“太太，你还是不要妒忌吧。美貌并不能使人高尚，衣着也不能使人尊贵。"</p>“唔，真的吗？那你就等着瞧吧，瑞德.巴特勒，我要做个样子给你看看，现在我有了--我们有了，我要成为你从来没有见过的最尊贵的女性。"<p>“我非常乐意等着瞧。"他说。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">More exciting than the people she met were the frocks Rhett bought her, superintending the choice of colors, materials and designs himself. Hoops were out now, and the new styles were charming with the skirts pulled back from the front and draped over bustles, and on the bustles were wreaths of Sowers and bows and cascades of lace. She thought of the modest hoops of the war years and she felt a little embarrassed at these new skirts which undeniably outlined her abdomen. And the darling little bonnets that were not really bonnets at all, but flat little affairs worn over one eye and laden with fruits and flowers, dancing plumes and fluttering ribbons! (If only Rhett had not been so silly and burned the false curls she bought to augment her knot of Indian-straight hair that peeked from the rear of these little hats!) And the delicate convent-made underwear! How lovely it was and how many sets she had! Chemises and nightgowns and petticoats of the finest linen trimmed with dainty embroidery and infinitesimal tucks. And the satin slippers Rhett bought her! They had heels three inches high and huge glittering paste buckles on them. And silk stockings, a dozen pairs and not a one had cotton tops! What riches!</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉会见的这些人固然使她兴奋，瑞德给她的衣服更使她兴奋。衣服的颜色、料子、款式都是他亲自挑选的。用圆箍撑起来的裙子现在已经不时兴了，流行的式样非常新颖，裙子从前面向后在腰垫处收拢，腰垫上装饰着花环，蝴蝶结，还有波浪形的花边，她觉得还是战争期间那种用圆箍撑起来的裙子好，现在这种新式裙子把肚子的轮廓都露出来了，使她觉得有些难为情。那可爱的小帽子简直不像帽子，而是一个扁平的小玩艺儿，斜着搭在一只眼上，上面别着花呀，果呀，走起路来羽毛跳跃，丝带飘动。（思嘉的头发像印地安人的头发一样硬，小帽子压不住，她买过一些假的发卷，想用来衬一下，可惜都让瑞德糊里糊涂地烧掉了。）还有修道院里做的精细内衣，实在可爱，而且买了那么多套。还有一件件睡衣、睡袍、衬裙，都是用最细的亚麻布做的，上面绣着华丽的图案，纳着细碎的小褶。还在瑞德给她买的缎子拖鞋，后跟有三寸高，玻璃大鞋，闪闪发光。长统丝袜有十几双，没有一双是棉统的。真阔气呀！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She recklessly bought gifts for the family. A furry St. Bernard puppy for Wade, who had always longed for one, a Persian kitten for Beau, a coral bracelet for little Ella, a heavy necklace with moonstone pendants for Aunt Pitty, a complete set of Shakespeare for Melanie and Ashley, an elaborate livery for Uncle Peter, including a high silk coachman’s hat with a brush upon it, dress lengths for Dilcey and Cookie, expensive gifts for everyone at Tara.
<p>“But what have you bought for Mammy?” questioned Rhett, looking over the pile of gifts spread out on the bed in their hotel room, and removing the puppy and kitten to the dressing room.</p>“Not a thing. She was hateful. Why should I bring her a present when she called us mules?”
</div>
  <div class="right">她毫无节制地花钱给家里人买礼物，给韦德买了一只圣比纳种的长毛小狗，因为他一直想要这样的一条狗。给小博买了一只小波斯猫，给小爱拉买了一只珊瑚手镯。给皮蒂姑妈买的是一大串项链，上面挂着许多月长石坠子，给媚兰和艾希礼买的是一套《莎士比亚全集》。她给彼得大叔买一套很像样的制服，包括一顶车夫戴的真丝高帽子，外带一把刷子，给迪尔茜和厨娘买的是衣料，给住在塔拉的人也都了买了昂贵的礼物。<p>“可是你给嬷嬷买什么呢？"瑞德在旅馆里把小猫、小狗都赶到梳妆室里，一面看着床摆的这一大堆礼物，一面问。</p>“什么也没买。这个人太可恨。她说咱们是骡子，干吗要给她礼物？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why should you so resent hearing the truth, my pet? You must bring Mammy a present It would break her heart if you didn’t—and hearts like hers are too valuable to be broken.”
<p>“I won’t take her a thing. She doesn’t deserve it.”</p>Then I’ll buy her one. I remember my mammy always said that when she went to Heaven she wanted a taffeta petticoat so stiff that it would stand by itself and so rustly that the Lord God would think it was made of angels’ wings. I’ll buy Mammy some red taffeta and have an elegant petticoat made.”
<p>“She won’t take it from you. She’d die rather than wear it.”</p>“I don’t doubt it But I’ll make the gesture just the same.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你何必怀恨在心呢，人家说的是真情实况，我的小宝贝儿？你一定得给嬷嬷买一件礼物。你要是不给她礼物，就会刺伤她的心--像她那样的心是很可贵的，怎么能刺伤呢？"<p>“我什么也不给她买，她不配。"</p>“那我就给她买一件吧，我记得我的奶奶常说，她升天的时候要穿一条府绸裙子，这裙了要硬得能立得住，而且非常扑素，上帝一看会以为是用天使的翅膀做的。我就给嬷嬷买块红府绸，让她做一条漂亮裙子吧。"<p>“她不会接受你的礼物的。她宁可去死，也不会穿的。"</p>“这我相信，不过我还是要表达我的心意。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The shops of New Orleans were so rich and exciting and shopping with Rhett was an adventure. Dining with him was an adventure too, and one more thrilling than shopping, for he knew what to order and how it should be cooked. The wines and liqueurs and champagnes of New Orleans were new and exhilarating to her, acquainted with only homemade blackberry and scuppernong vintages and Aunt Pitty’s “swoon” brandy; but oh, the food Rhett ordered! Best of all things in New Orleans was the food. Remembering the bitter hungry days at Tara and her more recent penury, Scarlett felt that she could never eat enough of these rich dishes. Gumboes and shrimp Creole, doves in wine and oysters in crumbly patties full of creamy sauce, mushrooms and sweetbreads and turkey livers, fish baked cunningly in oiled paper and limes. Her appetite never dulled, for whenever she remembered the everlasting goobers and dried peas and sweet potatoes at Tara, she felt an urge to gorge herself anew of Creole dishes.</div>
  <div class="right">新奥尔良的商店里物品丰富，使人目不暇接，和瑞德一起买东西是令人兴奋的。和他一起下馆子，更加令人兴奋，因为他知道点什么菜，也知道菜是应该怎么做的。新奥尔良的葡萄酒，露酒的香槟，对她说来都很新鲜，喝下去感到心旷神怡，因为她只喝过自家酿制的黑莓酒、野葡萄酒和皮蒂姑妈的"一喝不醉”的白兰地。这还不说，还有瑞德点的那些菜呢。新奥尔良的菜肴最有名。思嘉想到过去在塔拉挨饿的苦日子，又想到不久前拮据的生活，吃起这些丰盛的菜肴来，觉得老也吃不够。有法式烩虾仁、醉鸽、酥脆的牡蛎馅饼、蘑菇杂碎烩鸡肝，橙汗烤鱼，等等。她的胃口总是很好的，因为她一想到在塔拉没完没了地吃花生、豆子和白薯，就想尽量多吃一些法式菜肴。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">You eat as though each meal were your last,” said Rhett. “Don’t scrape the plate, Scarlett. I’m sure there’s more in the kitchen. You have only to ask the waiter. If you don’t stop being such a glutton, you’ll be as fat as the Cuban ladies and then I shall divorce you.”
<p>But she only put out her tongue at him and ordered another pastry, thick with chocolate and stuffed with meringue.</p>What fun it was to be able to spend as much money as you liked and not count pennies and feel that you should save them to pay taxes or buy mules. What fun to be with people who were gay and rich and not genteelly poor like Atlanta people. What fun to wear rustling brocade dresses that showed your waist and all your neck and arms and more than a little of your breast and know that men were admiring you. And what fun to eat all you wanted without having censorious people say you weren’t ladylike. And what fun to drink all the champagne you pleased. The first time she drank too much, she was embarrassed when she awoke the next-morning with a splitting headache and an awful memory of singing “Bonnie Blue Flag” all the way back to the hotel, through the streets of New Orleans, in an open carriage. She had never seen a lady even tipsy, and the only drunken woman she had ever seen had been that Watling creature on the day when Atlanta fell. She hardly knew how to face Rhett, so great was her humiliation, but the affair seemed only to amuse him. Everything she did seemed to amuse him, as though she were a gamboling kitten.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你每次吃饭就像吃最后一顿似的，"瑞德说。"不要刮盘子呀，思嘉。厨房里肯定还有呢。只要叫堂倌去拿就行了。你不要老这么大吃大嚼，不然你就会胖得跟古巴女人一样，到那时候，我可就要和你离婚了。"<p>可是她只朝他吐了吐舌头，接着又要了一份点心。这点心上面是厚厚的一层巧克力，中间还夹着一层糖。</p>想花多少钱，就花多少钱，不必一分一厘地考虑，惦记着要存钱要纳税，或者买骡子，这可实在是痛快。交往的人都很高兴很阔气，不像亚特兰大的人那么穷酸样儿，真是痛快，穿着啊啊啊啊的锦缎衣裳，显出腰身，露着脖子和胳膊，胸脯也露着不小的一块，而且还知道男人们对你垂涎欲滴，真是痛快。想吃什么，就吃什么，也没有人指责你缺乏大家闺秀的风度，真是痛快。香槟酒，想喝多少喝多少，也真是痛快。她头一次喝醉的时候，坐着敞篷马车，穿过新奥尔良的大街小巷回旅馆去，一路上高唱《美丽的蓝旗》。第二天清早醒来以后，头疼得像要裂开一样，想起头一天晚上那样出洋相，感到很不好意思，她以前连女人微有醉意也没见过。她只见过一个女人，就是那个名叫沃特琳的家伙，在亚特兰大失陷的那一天喝得酩酊大醉，她感到非常难为情，简直没有脸见瑞德，但他觉得这件事很有意思，无论她干什么事，他都觉得很有意思，仿佛她是一只性情活泼的小猫。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was exciting to go out with him for he was so handsome. Somehow she had never given his looks a thought before, and in Atlanta everyone had been too preoccupied with his shortcomings ever to talk about his appearance. But here in New Orleans she could see how the eyes of other women followed him and how they fluttered when he bent over their hands. The realization that other women were attracted by her husband, and perhaps envied her, made her suddenly proud to be seen by his side.
<p>“Why, we’re a handsome people,” thought Scarlett with pleasure.</p>Yes, as Rhett had prophesied, marriage could be a lot of fun. Not only was it fun but she was learning many things. That was odd in itself, because Scarlett had thought life could teach her no more. Now she felt like a child, every day on the brink of a new discovery.
</div>
  <div class="right">和他一道出去，也是一件非常令人兴奋的事。因为他长得漂亮。过去不知怎么，她从来没有考虑过他的相貌。在亚特兰大，人们光只看他的缺点，从没有议论过他的相貌，可是在新奥尔良，她发现别的女人总是用眼睛盯着他，他弯腰吻她们的手，她们显得那么激动，她意识到她丈夫很有魅力，也许别的女人还在羡慕她，这使她突然感到和他在一起十分光彩。<p>“唔，我们两口子都很漂亮，"思嘉心里乐滋滋的想道。</p>是的，的确是像瑞德所说的那样，结婚是有很乐趣的。不光是乐趣，她还学到了很多东西。这件事说起来也很怪，因为她曾经认为生活不可能再教给她什么新东西了。可现在她觉得自己像个孩子，每天都会有新的发现.</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">First, she learned that marriage with Rhett was a far different matter from marriage with either Charles or Frank. They had respected her and been afraid of her temper. They had begged for favors and if it pleased her, she had bestowed them. Rhett did not fear her and, she often thought, did not respect her very much either. What he wanted to do, he did, and if she did not like it, he laughed at her. She did not love him but he was undoubtedly an exciting person to live with. The most exciting thing about him was that even in his outbursts of passion which were flavored sometimes with cruelty, sometimes with irritating amusement, he seemed always to be holding himself under restraint, always riding his emotions with a curb bit.</div>
  <div class="right">首先，她发现和瑞德结婚，与先前和查尔斯结婚，和弗兰克结婚，有很大的区别，他们都尊重她，怕她发脾气。他们都向她祈求恩惠，她要是高兴，也就给他们一些恩惠，而瑞德并不怕她，而且她常常觉得瑞德并不怎么尊重她。他想干什么，就干什么，思嘉要是不喜欢，他反觉得很有趣，思嘉并不爱他，但和他生活在一起确实很意思，最有意思的是，虽然他这个人发起火来有时让人觉得他有些冷酷，有时他倒是痛快了，别人却感到厌烦，他却总能控制自己的感情，就像有一副马嚼子似的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I guess that’s because he isn’t really in love with me,” she thought and was content enough with the state of affairs. “I should hate for him to ever turn completely loose in any way.” But still the thought of the possibility teased her curiosity in an exciting way.
<p>Living with Rhett, she learned many new things about him, and she had thought she knew him so well. She learned that his voice could be as silky as a cat’s fur one moment and crisp and crackling with oaths the next. He could tell, with apparent sincerity and approval, stories of courage and honor and virtue and love in the odd places he had been, and follow them with ribald stories of coldest cynicism. She knew no man should tell such stories to his wife but they were entertaining and they appealed to something coarse and earthy in her. He could be an ardent, almost a tender, lover for a brief while, and almost immediately a mocking devil who ripped the lid from her gunpowder temper, fired it and enjoyed the explosion. She learned that his compliments were always two edged and his tenderest expressions open to suspicion. In fact, in those two weeks in New Orleans, she learned everything about him except what he really was.</p></div>
  <div class="right">“我想这大概是他并不真爱我的缘故吧，"她心里想，而且她对这种情况也还是满意的。"我还真不希望他完全放纵自己的感情。"不过她觉得这种可能性也是存在的，这个想法使她既兴奋又好奇。<p>她和瑞德结合之后，了解到他许多新的情况，她原来还以为对他非常了解呢。她了解到他的声音一会儿温柔得像猫，一会儿又变成尖利的咒骂声。他可以表面上一本正经地赞扬在他去过的怪地方发生的英雄的、光荣的事迹和关于贞节与情爱的故事，马上又说一些最无情的玩世不恭的下流故事。她知道任何一个正派男人都不会对妻子讲这样的故事，不过这些故事的确有趣，而且能在她身边引起一种粗俗的感情，他可以说是一个既热诚又温柔的情人，一转眼又变成了挖苦人的恶魔，把她那火药一般的脾气揭开盖子，点上火，引起爆炸，从中取乐。她了解到他的奉承总有两层截然相反的涵义，他表现出来的最温柔的感情也是值得怀疑的。实际上，她待在新奥尔良的两个星期里，她了解了他各方面的情况，就是没了解他究竟是个什么人。</p>  </div></div>
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Some mornings he dismissed the maid and brought her the breakfast tray himself and fed her as though she were a child, took the hairbrush from her hand and brushed her long dark hair until it snapped and crackled. Yet other mornings she was torn rudely out of deep slumber when he snatched all the bed covers from her and tickled her bare feet. Sometimes he listened with dignified interest to details of her businesses, nodding approval at her sagacity, and at other times he called her somewhat dubious tradings scavenging, highway robbery and extortion. He took her to plays and annoyed her by whispering that God probably didn’t approve of such amusements, and to churches and, sotto voce, retailed funny obscenities and then reproved her for laughing. He encouraged her to speak her mind, to be flippant and daring. She picked up from him the gift of stinging words and sardonic phrases and learned to relish using them for the power they gave her over other people. But she did not possess his sense of humor which tempered his malice, nor his smile that jeered at himself even while he was jeering others.</div>
  <div class="right">有时他早上不用女佣人，亲自用托盘把早点给她送到房里，一点一点地喂她，仿佛她是个孩子，他还把头刷从她手里拿过来，给她刷头发，刷得那乌黑的长头发噼啪作响。可是，有时候他早上突然把她身上盖的东西全打开，挠她的脚，粗暴地把她从酣睡中惊醒。有时候他很认真的仔细听她述说生意中的各项细节，点头称赞她办事有头脑，有时候他就把她那些不是很正当的做法叫做捡便宜，叫做投机取巧。他带她去看戏，却悄悄地对她说也许上帝不赞成她到这种娱乐场所来，惹得她心烦，他带她到教堂去，却小声对她说些有趣的下流话，然后又责怪她发笑。他鼓励她有什么说什么，随便说，不拘束。她从他那里学了一些讽刺人挖苦人的字眼，而且逐渐喜欢使用这些字眼，觉得这样可以压人家一头，但是她还不会像瑞德那样，在恶毒之中搀上几分幽默，讥笑自己的时候，实际上是在讥笑别人。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He made her play and she had almost forgotten how. Life had been so serious and so bitter. He knew how to play and swept her along with him. But he never played like a boy; he was a man and no matter what he did, she could never forget it. She could not look down on him from the heights of womanly superiority, smiling as women have always smiled at the antics of men who are boys at heart.
<p>This annoyed her a little, whenever she thought of it. It would be pleasant to feel superior to Rhett. All the other men she had known she could dismiss with a half-contemptuous “What a child!” Her father, the Tarleton twins with their love of teasing and their elaborate practical jokes, the hairy little Fontaines with their childish rages, Charles, Frank, all the men who had paid court to her during the war—everyone, in fact except Ashley. Only Ashley and Rhett eluded her understanding and her control for they were both adults, and the elements of boyishness were lacking in them.</p>She did not understand Rhett, nor did she trouble to understand him, though there were things about him which occasionally puzzled her. There was the way he looked at her sometimes, when he thought she was unaware. Turning quickly she frequently caught him watching her, an alert eager, waiting look in his eyes.
</div>
  <div class="right">他想让她玩儿，而她几乎已经忘了怎么玩了。生活一直是那么严峻，那么艰难，他是知道怎么玩的，而且带着她一起玩。但是他是一个成年人，不能像小孩子那样玩了；他的一举一动，她是不会忘记的。妇人看到尚有童心的男人做出滑稽可笑的动作不免要发笑，而思嘉是不能凭着女人的优越看不起瑞德，朝他发笑的。<p>她一想到这些情况，就觉得不愉快。要是能比瑞德高出一筹就好了。她所认识的别的男人，她都可以置不顾，以半带鄙视的口吻说：“简直是个孩子！"比如她父亲，比如好开玩笑，喜欢各种恶作剧的塔尔顿挛生兄弟，方丹家长着长毛，爱耍小孩子脾气的年轻人，查尔斯，弗兰克，所有在战争期间追求过她的人--实际上包括所有的人，艾希礼除外。只有艾希礼和瑞德是她无法理解无法控制的人，因为他们是成年人，身上没有孩子气。</p>她并不了解瑞德，也不想去了解他。虽然他有时候有些事使她迷惑不解。比如他有时以为她不注意，就偷眼看她，那眼神就很怪很怪。她突然一转身，常常发现他在看她，眼中流露出机警。殷切与等待的神情。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why do you look at me like that?” she once asked irritably. “Like a cat at a mouse hole!”
<p>But his face had changed swiftly and he only laughed. Soon she forgot it and did not puzzle her head about it any more, or about anything concerning Rhett. He was too unpredictable to bother about and life was very pleasant—except when she thought of Ashley.</p>Rhett kept her too busy to think of Ashley often. Ashley was hardly ever in her thoughts during the day but at night when she was tired from dancing or her head was spinning from too much champagne—then she thought of Ashley. Frequently when she lay drowsily in Rhett’s arms with the moonlight streaming over the bed, she thought how perfect life would be if it were only Ashley’s arms which held her so closely, if it were only Ashley who drew her black hair across his face and wrapped it about his throat.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你为什么这样盯着我？"有一次她高兴地问。"好像一只猫盯着耗子洞！"<p>但是他马上换上一副模样，只笑一笑，过了一会儿，她就忘了，不再费脑筋想这件事，和瑞德有关的一切事都不想了。他这个人总是反复无常，不必为他多费心思，生活也过得挺愉快--可是一想到艾希礼就不同了。</p>瑞德弄得她很忙，白天，她脑子里几乎就没有艾希礼，可是到了晚上，她跳舞跳累了，或者喝香槟喝得头晕脑胀--这时候，她就想起艾希礼来了。她迷迷糊糊地躺在瑞德怀里，月光洒落在床上，在这种情况下，她常常想，要是艾希礼的胳臂这样紧紧地接着她，该有多好呀！要是艾希礼把她的黑发从自己脸上撩开，拢在下巴底下，又该有多好呀！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Once when she was thinking this, she sighed and turned her head toward the window, and after a moment she felt the heavy arm beneath her neck become like iron, and Rhett’s voice spoke in the stillness: “May God damn your cheating little soul to hell for all eternity!”
<p>And, getting up, he put on his shoes and left the room despite her startled protests and questions. He reappeared the next morning as she was breakfasting in her room, disheveled, quite drunk and in his won’t sarcastic mood, and neither made excuses nor gave an account of his absence.</p>Scarlett asked no questions and was quite cool to him, as became an injured wife, and when she had finished the meal, she dressed under his bloodshot gaze and went shopping. He was gone when she returned and did not appear again until time for supper.
</div>
  <div class="right">有一次，她又这样想着，叹了一口气，扭头朝窗口看去。过了一会儿，她感到脖子底下这只有力的胳臂好像成了铁的一样，在寂静之中听见瑞德的声音说：“上帝该把你永远打入地狱，你这个小妖精！"<p>说罢，他起来穿上衣服，走了出去，思嘉非常吃惊，拦他也拦不住，问他他也不理。第二天早晨，她正在自己屋里吃饭时，他才回来，头发乱蓬蓬的，喝得醉醺醺的，不满的怀绪依然很重，他即不道歉，也没有说明干什么去了。</p>思嘉什么也没问，对他十分冷淡，妻子受了委屈，这样做也是很自然的。她吃完饭之后，瑞德用带着血丝的眼睛看着她换上衣服，出去买东西了。等她回来时，他已经走了，到吃晚的时候才回来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was a silent meal and Scarlett’s temper was straining because it was her last supper in New Orleans and she wanted to do justice to the crawfish. And she could not enjoy it under his gaze. Nevertheless she ate a large one, and drank a quantity of champagne. Perhaps it was this combination that brought back her old nightmare that evening, for she awoke, cold with sweat, sobbing brokenly. She was back at Tara again and Tara was desolate. Mother was dead and with her all the strength and wisdom of the world. Nowhere in the world was there anyone to turn to, anyone to rely upon. And something terrifying was pursuing her and she was running, running till her heart was bursting, running in a thick swimming fog, crying out, blindly seeking that nameless, unknown haven of safety that was somewhere in the mist about her.</div>
  <div class="right">这顿晚饭吃得很沉闷，思嘉一直耐着性子，因为这是她在新奥尔良吃的最后一顿晚饭了，而且她还想好好享受一下龙虾的美味。可是瑞德总盯着她，使她吃也吃不痛快。不过她还是吃了一只大的，还喝了好多香槟。也许是因为各种因素加在一起，当天晚上她又作起了过去作过的噩梦。她醒来，出了一身冷汗，抽抽搭搭地哭起来。她梦见自己又回到了塔拉，而塔拉是一片荒凉。母亲去世了，世上的一切力量与智慧也都随之消逝。世界上没有一个人可投靠，没有任何人可以依赖。有一个可怕的东西在追她，她就跑啊，跑啊，心都快炸开了，就这样茫茫大雾之中一边跑，一边喊，模模糊糊地想在周围的雾里找到一个不知名的、没有去过的地方躲藏起来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Rhett was leaning over her when she woke, and without a word he picked her up in his arms like a child and held her close, his hard muscles comforting, his wordless murmuring soothing, until her sobbing ceased.
<p>“Oh, Rhett, I was so cold and so hungry and so tired and I couldn’t find it. I ran through the mist and I ran but I couldn’t find it.”</p>“Find what, honey?”
<p>“I don’t know. I wish I did know.”</p>“Is it your old dream?”
</div>
  <div class="right">她醒来，发现瑞德正弯着腰看她。他什么话也没说，就把她抱起来搂在怀里，好像搂着孩子一样，搂得紧紧的。他那结实的肌肉给她以安慰，他那低声细语使她感到镇静，感到安慰，过了会一儿，她也就不哭了。<p>“唔，瑞德，我刚才又冷，又饿，又累，而且怎么也找不着，我在雾里跑啊，跑啊，可就是找不着。"</p>“你找什么，亲爱的？"<p>“我也不知道，我要是知道就好了。"</p>“又是以前作过的梦吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, yes!”
<p>He gently placed her on the bed, fumbled in the darkness and lit a candle. In the light his face with bloodshot eyes and harsh lines was as unreadable as stone. His shirt, opened to the waist, showed a brown chest covered with thick black hair. Scarlett, still shaking with fright, thought how strong and unyielding that chest was, and she whispered: “Hold me, Rhett.”</p>“Darling!” he said swiftly, and picking her up he sat down in a large chair, cradling her body against him.
<p>“Oh, Rhett, it’s awful to be hungry.”</p>“It must be awful to dream of starvation after a seven-course dinner including that enormous crawfish.” He smiled but his eyes were kind.
</div>
  <div class="right">“嗯，是的！"<p>他轻轻地把她放在床上，在黑暗之中摸索着点上一支蜡烛。在蜡光下。他的眼睛带着血丝，他的脸上纹路像石头一样清晰，看不出任何表情。他穿着衬衫，敞着怀，棕色的胸膛露在外面，上面长着厚厚的胸毛，思嘉还在吓得发抖，心里想，这个胸膛可是真坚强。她悄悄地说“抱抱我吧，瑞德。"</p>“亲爱的！"他马上一边说，一边把她抱起来，坐在一把大椅子上，把她的身子紧紧地搂在怀里。<p>“唔，瑞德，挨饿可是真可怕呀！”</p>“晚饭吃了七道菜，包括一只大龙虾，夜里睡觉还要梦见挨饿，一定是非常可怕的。”他笑了笑，不过眼睛里还是射出了和蔼的目光。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, Rhett, I just run and run and hunt and I can’t ever find what it is I’m hunting for. It’s always hidden in the mist. I know if I could find it, I’d be safe forever and ever and never be cold or hungry again.”
<p>“Is it a person or a thing you’re hunting?”</p>“I don’t know. I never thought about it. Rhett, do you think I’ll ever dream that I get there to safety?”
<p>“No,” he said, smoothing her tumbled hair, “I don’t. Dreams aren’t like that. But I do think that if you get used to being safe and warm and well fed in your everyday life, you’ll stop dreaming that dream. And, Scarlett, I’m going to see that you are safe.”</p>“Rhett, you are so nice.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，瑞德，我使劲跑啊，跑啊，找我要找的什么东西，就是找不着。躲在雾里，看不见。我知道，我要是能找到它，我就永远生活安定，再也不会受冷冻挨饿了。"<p>“你是在找一个人，还是在找一样东西？"</p>“我也不知道，我没好好想过，瑞德，你觉得我还会梦想上生活安定的地方去吗？"<p>“不会的，"他边说，边捋了捋她那篷乱的头发。"我认为不会的。作梦不应该是这样作的。不过我认为你要是平时习惯于安定的生活，吃得饱，穿得暖，你就不会再作那样的梦了。思嘉，我一定使你过安定的生活。"</p>“瑞德，你真好。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Thanks for the crumbs from your table, Mrs. Dives. Scarlett, I want you to say to yourself every morning when you wake up: ‘I can’t ever be hungry again and nothing can ever touch me so long as Rhett is here and the United States government holds out.”
<p>“The United States government?” she questioned, sitting up, startled, tears still on her cheeks.</p>“The ex-Confederate money has now become an honest woman. I invested most of it in government bonds.”
<p>“God’s nightgown!” cried Scarlett, sitting up in his lap, forgetful of her recent terror. “Do you mean to tell me you’ve loaned your money to the Yankees?”</p>“At a fair per cent.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“感谢您的照顾，太太，思嘉，我劝你每天早上起来的时候就对自己说：'我永远不会再挨饿了，我永远不会再有麻烦了，只要瑞德和我在一起，只要美国政府能维持下去，’"<p>“美国政府？"她吃惊地问，随着就坐起来，脸上的泪珠还没有干。</p>“过去联盟的钱现在已经变成了贞洁的女人，我用一大部分买了公债了。”<p>“我的老天爷！"思嘉喊道，直直地坐在他腿上，刚才的噩梦也全然忘记了。"你的意思是说你把钱借给了北方佬吗？"</p>“利息相当高啊！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I don’t care if it’s a hundred percent! You must sell them immediately. The idea of letting the Yankees have the use of your money!”
<p>“And what must I do with it?” he questioned with a smile, noting that her eyes were no longer wide with fright.</p>“Why—why buy property at Five Points. I’ll bet you could buy all of Five Points with the money you have.”
<p>“Thank you, but I wouldn’t have Five Points. Now that the Carpetbagger government has really gotten control of Georgia, there’s no telling what may happen, I wouldn’t put anything beyond the swarm of buzzards that’s swooping down on Georgia now from north, east, south and west. I’m playing along with them, you understand, as a good Scalawag should do, but I don’t trust them. And I’m not putting my money in real estate. I prefer bonds. You can hide them. You can’t hide real estate very easily.”</p>“Do you think—” she began, paling as she thought of the mills and store.
</div>
  <div class="right">“百分之百的利息我也不管，你一定要马上卖掉。让北方佬用你的钱，亏你想得出。"<p>“那我这钱怎么花呢？"他笑着问，这时他发现她已经不像刚才那样吓得睁着大眼睛了。</p>“怎么--怎么花，你可以到五点镇去买地皮呀。我敢说，你那些足可以把整个五点镇都买下来也够了。"<p>“谢谢你，可是我不想要五点镇。现在北方冒险家的政府真正控制了佐治亚，很难说会再发生什么大事。成群的秃鹰正从四面八方向佐治亚起来，我不想逃避，我要和他们周旋，你明白吗，做一个像样的投靠北方人的人就得么这干，不过我并不信任他们。我也不想把钱用买房地产，我愿意买公债，公债可以藏起来，房地产就不那么好藏了。”</p>“你认为--"她问，因为她想起自己经营的木材厂商店，脸都发白了。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I don’t know. But don’t look so frightened, Scarlett. Our charming new governor is a good friend of mine. It’s just that times are too uncertain now and I don’t want much of my money tied up in real estate.”
<p>He shifted her to one knee and, leaning back, reached for a cigar and lit it. She sat with her bare feet dangling, watching the play of muscles on his brown chest, her terrors forgotten.</p>“And while we are on the subject of real estate, Scarlett,” he said, “I am going to build a house. You might have bullied Frank into living in Miss Pitty’s house, but not me. I don’t believe I could bear her vaporings three times a day and, moreover, I believe Uncle Peter would assassinate me before he would let me live under the sacred Hamilton roof. Miss Pitty can get Miss India Wilkes to stay with her and keep the bogyman away. When we get back to Atlanta we are going to stay in the bridal suite of the National Hotel until our house is finished. Before we left Atlanta I was dickering for that big lot on Peachtree, the one near the Leyden house. You know the one I mean?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我不知道。不过你用不着这么害怕，思嘉，新上任的州长是我的朋友。现在时局还不太稳定，我不想把很多钱投放在房地产上。"<p>他把她挪到条腿上，微微向后一仰，伸手拿了一支雪茄点上，她两只赤脚悬空坐在那里，看着他棕色胸膛上的肌肉伸缩，就把害怕的事全忘了。</p>“既然谈房地产，思嘉，"他说。"我打算盖一所房子，除可以强迫弗兰克住在皮蒂小姐的房子里，我可不行。一天到晚听她嚷嚷三回，我可受不了。还有，彼得大叔就是把我杀了，也不会让我住进神圣的汉密尔顿家的房子。皮蒂小姐可以请英迪亚.威尔克斯小姐和她同住，免得坏人来捣乱，咱们回到亚特兰大以后，先住在民族饭店的新婚套间里，等咱们的房子盖好了就搬过去。咱们离开亚特兰大之前，我就在跟他们讨价还价，准备买下桃树街那一大片空地，就是莱顿家旁边那块空地，你一定知道我说的地方。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, Rhett, how lovely! I do so want a house of my own. A great big one!”
<p>“Then at last we are agreed on something. What about a white stucco with wrought-iron work like these Creole houses here?”</p>“Oh, no, Rhett. Not anything old fashioned like these New Orleans houses. I know just what I want. It’s the newest thing because I saw a picture of it in—let me see—it was in that Harper’s Weekly I was looking at. It was modeled after a Swiss chalet.”
<p>“A Swiss what?”</p>“A chalet.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“啊，瑞德，这简直是太好了。我多么想有一所属于自己的房子呀。我要一所特大的。"<p>“咱们总算在这件事上有了一致的看法，盖一所和这里的法式建筑一样的白灰墙、铁花栏杆的房子，好不好？"</p>“唔，不好，瑞德，不要新奥尔良这种老式的房子。我要最新式的，我看到过一个图样，在--让我想一想--在我看一份《哈沪斯周报》上，是模仿一所瑞士ｃｈａｌｅｔ。"<p>“一所瑞士什么？"</p>“ｃｈａｌｅｔ。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Spell it.”
<p>She complied.</p>“Oh,” he said and stroked his mustache.
<p>“It was lovely. It had a high mansard roof with a picket fence on top and a tower made of fancy shingles at each end. And the towers had windows with red and blue glass in them. It was so stylish looking.”</p>“I suppose it had jigsaw work on the porch banisters?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“哪几个字母？"<p>她把这个词的读法告诉了他。</p>“噢，"他一面说，一面捋了捋小胡子。<p>“非常好看，斜度不同分成两段的屋顶上，上面有一溜栅栏，两头各有一个尖塔，是用彩色木瓦板盖的。尖塔上的窗户镶着红蓝琉璃。看上去可时髦了！"</p>“我想回廓上还有锯齿形的栏杆吧？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes.”
<p>“And a fringe of wooden scrollwork hanging from the roof of the porch?”</p>“Yes. You must have seen one like it.”
<p>“I have—but not in Switzerland. The Swiss are a very intelligent race and keenly alive to architectural beauty. Do you really want a house like that?”</p>“Oh, yes!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“是埃"<p>“回廊屋顶的边上还有木头做的云形花饰垂下来，是不是？"</p>“是的。你一定见过这么一所房子。"<p>“我是见过--但不是在瑞士。瑞士人非常聪明，对建筑艺术更有独到之处，你真的要这样一所房子吗？"</p>“啊，是呀！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I had hoped that association with me might Improve your taste. Why not a Creole house or a Colonial with six white columns?”
<p>“I tell you I don’t want anything tacky and old-fashioned looking. And inside let’s have red wall paper and red velvet portieres over all the folding doors and oh, lots of expensive walnut furniture and grand thick carpets and—oh, Rhett, everybody will be pea green when they see our house!”</p>“It is very necessary that everyone shall be envious? Well, if you like they shall be green. But Scarlett, has it occurred to you that it’s hardly in good taste to furnish the house on so lavish a scale when everyone is so poor?”
<p>“I want it that way,” she said obstinately. “I want to make everybody who’s been mean to me feel bad. And we’ll give big receptions that’ll make the whole town wish they hadn’t said such nasty things.”</p>“But who will come to our receptions?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我原来希望你和我结婚之后，能提高你的格调，你为什么不喜欢法式房子，或六根白柱子的殖民地式的房子呢？"<p>“实话对你说吧，看上去过时的，俗气的，我都不想要，里面我要用红纸糊墙，用红天鹅绒做门帘。啊，我要有好多高级胡桃木家具，还要华丽的厚地毯，还要--啊，瑞德，当别人看了咱们的家，都会羡慕得脸以发青的。"</p>“有必要让大家这样羡慕咱们吗？你要是高兴，可以让他们羡慕得脸色发青。不过，思嘉。你想过没有，现在大家都这么穷，咱们布置房子这样摆阔气，能算是格调高吗？"<p>“我就要这样，"固执地说。“过去他们对我们那么刻薄那么看不起，现在我也不能让他们好受，我们要大开宴会，让全城的人后悔当时不该说那么多难听的话。"</p>“可是谁会来参加我们的宴会呢？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why, everybody, of course.”
<p>“I doubt it. The Old Guard dies but it never surrenders.”</p>“Oh, Rhett, how you run on! If you’ve got money, people always like you.”
<p>“Not Southerners. It’s harder for speculators’ money to get into the best parlors than for the camel to go through the needle’s eye. And as for Scalawags—that’s you and me, my pet—we’ll be lucky if we aren’t spit upon. But if you’d like to try, I’ll back you, my dear, and I’m sure I shall enjoy your campaign intensely. And while we are on the subject of money, let me make this clear to you. You can have all the cash you want for the house and all you want for your fal-lals. And if you like jewelry, you can have it but I’m going to pick it out. You have such execrable taste, my pet. And anything you want for Wade or Ella. And if Will Benteen can’t make a go of the cotton, I’m willing to chip in and help out on that white elephant in Clayton County that you love so much. That’s fair enough, isn’t it?”</p>“Of course. You’re very generous.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“当然是人人都会来的。"<p>“那可不一定。这些保守派是宁肯死了也不认输的。"</p>“唔，你这是说什么呀！你只要有钱，大家就一定喜欢你。"<p>“南方人可不是这样，有钱的投机商要想进入上等人家的客厅，比驼穿眼还要难。至于投靠北方的人--我是说我和你，我的宝贝儿--要不是受到唾弃，就算走运了。不过你要是想试一试，我可以全部支持你，亲爱的，我也一定会为你所作的一切努力感到非常高兴，既然一再谈到钱，那就让我把话说清楚，家里过日子，买穿戴，你要多少钱，我给你多少钱。你要是喜欢首饰，也可以买，但是要由我来帮你挑选，你的格调太低了，我的宝贝。给韦德，爱拉，想买什么，你就买什么。要是威尔.本廷种棉花种得好，我也愿意资助，帮你卸掉在克莱顿区你那么喜爱的那个沉重的包袱。这可以说是很公平了吧？"</p>“当然，当然，你是很慷慨的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“But listen closely. Not one cent for the store and not one cent for that kindling factory of yours.”
<p>“Oh,” said Scarlett, her face falling. All during the honeymoon she had been thinking how she could bring up the subject of the thousand dollars she needed to buy fifty feet more of land to enlarge her lumber yard.</p>“I thought you always bragged about being broad minded and not caring what people said about my running a business, and you’re just like every other man—so afraid people will say I wear the pants in the family.”
<p>“There’s never going to be any doubt in anybody’s mind about who wears the pants in the Butler family,” drawled Rhett. “I don’t care what fools say. In fact, I’m ill bred enough to be proud of having a smart wife. I want you to keep on running the store and the mills. They are your children’s. When Wade grows up he won’t feel right about being supported by his stepfather, and then he can take over the management. But not one cent of mine goes into either business.”</p>“Why?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“不过请你仔细听明白。一分钱也不能花在你那个商店上，一分钱也不能花你那劈柴厂上。"<p>“唔，"思嘉说，脸也沉下来，在这蜜月期间，她一直在想找个理由提起这个话题，要一千块钱，再买五十英尺地，扩大木材厂。</p>“我记得你老吹嘘，说自己是个开明的人，我做生意，别人有些什么议论，你全不在意，谁知你和所有的男人都一样，就怕人家说我当家。"<p>“咱们巴特勒家谁当家，那是任何人都不会有什么疑问的。"瑞德慢条斯理地说。"傻瓜说些什么，我是不介意的。其实，我缺乏教养，现在有个能干的老婆，也是件值得骄傲的事，我想让你继续经营你的木材厂。这全给你的孩子们留着吧。等韦德长大以后，他会觉得不能让继父养活了，他就可以接过去，继续经营，但是无论是商店，还是木材厂，我一个钱都不给。”</p>“那是为什么？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Because I don’t care to contribute to the support of Ashley Wilkes.”
<p>“Are you going to begin that again?”</p>“No. But you asked my reasons and I have given them. And another thing. Don’t think you can juggle books on me and lie about how much your clothes cost and how much it takes to run the house, so that you can use the money to buy more mules or another mill for Ashley. I intend to look over and carefully check your expenditures and I know what things cost. Oh, don’t get insulted. You’d do it. I wouldn’t put it beyond you. In fact, I wouldn’t put anything beyond you where either Tara or Ashley is concerned. I don’t mind Tara. But I must draw the line at Ashley. I’m riding you with a slack rein, my pet, but don’t forget that I’m riding with curb and spurs just the same.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“因为我不想资助艾希礼.威尔克斯。"<p>“你又来了，是不是？"</p>“不是。是你要问原因。我就把原因告诉你。还有一件事，你不要以为可以在帐目上耍点花招，来蒙骗我，说你买衣服花多少钱，家里的开销要多少钱，结果却把钱拿去替艾希礼买骡子，或者再买一个木材厂，我要监督审查你的各项开支，什么东西多少钱，我都清楚。唔，不要以为我是在侮辱你，你非这样做不可。我对你是不会放松的。实际上，凡是涉及塔拉和艾希礼的地方，我都不会对你放松，塔拉倒还无所谓，艾希礼可一定要划在界线以外，我正在缓缓地驾驭着你，我的宝贝儿，可是你不要忘记，同样也是有马嚼子和马刺的。”</div></div>
