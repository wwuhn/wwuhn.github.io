  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">AFTER PRISSY HAD GONE, Scarlett went wearily into the downstairs hall and lit a lamp. The house felt steamingly hot, as though it held in its walls all the heat of the noontide. Some of her dullness was passing now and her stomach was clamoring for food. She remembered she had had nothing to eat since the night before except a spoonful of hominy, and picking up the lamp she went into the kitchen. The fire in the oven had died but the room was stifling hot. She found half a pone of hard corn bread in the skillet and gnawed hungrily on it while she looked about for other food. There was some hominy left in the pot and she ate it with a big cooking spoon, not waiting to put it on a plate. It needed salt badly but she was too hungry to hunt for it. After four spoonfuls of it, the heat of the room was too much and, taking the lamp in one hand and a fragment of pone in the other, she went out into the hall.</div>
  <div class="right">百里茜走了以后，思嘉回到楼下过厅里，点上一盏灯。屋里热得像个蒸笼，仿佛把中午的热气全都关在里面了似的。她那迟钝的感觉已在逐渐消失，肚子开始闹着要吃东西了。她记起自己从昨夜到现在一直没吃过什么，只喝了一勺玉米粥，于是端灯走进厨房。那儿炉子里的火已经灭了，但还是闷热得很。她发现长柄浅锅里还有半张硬玉米饼，便拿起来大口大口地啃着，一面寻找别的食物。盆里还剩下一点玉米粥，她等不及把它倒进碟子里，便随手用大钓舀着吃起来。那是应当放盐的，可是她饿急了，懒得寻找，接连吃了四勺，她这才觉得厨房里实在太热，便一手拿灯一手抓一块玉米饼到过厅里去了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She knew she should go upstairs and sit beside Melanie. If anything went wrong, Melanie would be too weak to call. But the idea of returning to that room where she had spent so many nightmare hours was repulsive to her. Even if Melanie were dying, she couldn’t go back up there. She never wanted to see that room again. She set the lamp on the candle stand by the window and returned to the front porch. It was so much cooler here, and even the night was drowned in soft warmth. She sat down on the steps in the circle of faint light thrown by the lamp and continued gnawing on the corn bread.</div>
  <div class="right">她知道她应当上楼去陪伴媚兰。要是出什么事，媚兰也没有那个力气叫人呢。可是一想起要回到那间房里，那间她已经待过许多恶梦般钟点的房里，她就厌烦得很。哪怕媚兰就要死了，她也不能再回到那里去。她永远也不要再见那个房间了。她把灯放在窗边的烛台上，然后又回到前面走廊上去。这里凉快得多，尽管夜里的气温仍然是相当热的。她坐在台阶上，在灯火投过来的暗淡的光圈中，又啃起玉米饼来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When she had finished it, a measure of strength came back to her and with the strength came again the pricking of fear. She could hear a humming of noise far down the street, but what it portended she did not know. She could distinguish nothing but a volume of sound that rose and fell. She strained forward trying to hear and soon she found her muscles aching from the tension. More than anything in the world she yearned to hear the sound of hooves and to see Rhett’s careless, self-confident eyes laughing at her fears. Rhett would take them away, somewhere. She didn’t know where. She didn’t care.</div>
  <div class="right">她啃完玉米饼，体力恢复了些，揪心的恐惧也随之而来了。她听得见街上远处嗡嗡的嘈杂声，但不明白这意味着什么。她只觉得有种洪大的声响在时期时伏，但压根儿听不清楚。她聚精会神地向前倾着身子细听，很快就因为过于紧张而腰酸背疼起来。这时，世界上再没有别的事情叫她如此渴望的了，像现在渴望听到马蹄声、渴望看到瑞德那毫不在意和充满自信的眼光来嘲笑她的恐惧模样。瑞德会把她们带走，带到某个地方去。她不知道去哪里。她也不去管它。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As she sat straining her ears toward town, a faint glow appeared above the trees. It puzzled her. She watched it and saw it grow brighter. The dark sky became pink and then dull red, and suddenly above the trees, she saw a huge tongue of flame leap high to the heavens. She jumped to her feet, her heart beginning again its sickening thudding and bumping.</div>
  <div class="right">她坐在那里侧耳倾听市区的声音，这时树顶上升起一片隐隐的火光，使她觉得奇怪。她望着望着，那火光愈来愈亮。黑暗的天空发红了，先是粉红，随即变成深红，接着她突然看见一条巨大的火舌从树顶上蹿而起，高高地升到半空中。她猛地跳起来，心又开始发紧了！怦怦地跳个不停。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The Yankees had come! She knew they had come and they were burning the town. The flames seemed to be off to the east of the center of town. They shot higher and higher and widened rapidly into a broad expanse of red before her terrified eyes. A whole block must be burning. A faint hot breeze that had sprung up bore the smell of smoke to her.
<p>She fled up the stairs to her own room and hung out the window for a better view. The sky was a hideous lurid color and great swirls of black smoke went twisting up to hand in billowy clouds above the flames. The smell of smoke was stronger now. Her mind rushed incoherently here and there, thinking how soon the flames would spread up Peachtree Street and burn this house, how soon the Yankees would be rushing in upon her, where she would run, what she would do. All the fiends of hell seemed screaming in her ears and her brain swirled with confusion and panic so overpowering she clung to the window sill for support.</p>“I must think,” she told herself over and over. “I must think.”
</div>
  <div class="right">北方佬已经来了！她知道他们来了，正在那里烧毁市区。那些火焰好像在距市中心不远的东边。它们升得越来越高，同时迅速展成一大片红光，她看了十分害怕。一定是一整条大街烧起来了。一阵略带些热的微风从那边迎面吹来。她闻到了烟火味。<p>她跑到楼上自己的房间里，把半个身子探出窗外，想更好地看看整个情况。天空呈一片可怖的殷红色，大团大团的黑烟像云涛似的旋转着挂在火焰上空。现在烟火味更浓了。思嘉心乱如麻，时而认为这火焰会很快蔓延到桃树街，把这幢房子烧掉，时而设想北方佬会向她冲过来，她要往哪里逃跑，她要怎么对付。好像地狱里所有的魔鬼都在她耳边喊叫，她的脑子在极度的惶惑和惊恐中旋转起来，她不得不紧紧抓住窗棂，否则就要跌下去了。</p>“我得好好想想，"她在心里反复告诫自己。"我一定得想一想。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But thoughts eluded her, darting in and out of her mind like frightened humming birds. As she stood hanging to the sill, a deafening explosion burst on her ears, louder than any cannon she had ever heard. The sky was rent with gigantic flame. Then other explosions. The earth shook and the glass in the panes above her head shivered and came down around her.
<p>The world became an inferno of noise and flame and trembling earth as one explosion followed another in ear-splitting succession. Torrents of sparks shot to the sky and descended slowly, lazily, through blood-colored clouds of smoke. She thought she heard a feeble call from the next room but she paid it no heed. She had no time for Melanie now. No time for anything except a fear that licked through her veins as swiftly as the flames she saw. She was a child and mad with fright and she wanted to bury her head in her mother’s lap and shut out this sight. If she were only home! Home with Mother.</p>Through the nerve-shivering sounds, she heard another sound, that of fear-sped feet coming up the stairs three at a time, heard a voice yelping like a lost hound. Prissy broke into the room and, flying to Scarlett, clutched her arm in a grip that seemed to pinch out pieces of flesh.
</div>
  <div class="right">可是思绪躲避她，像只受惊的蜂鸟在她心头掠过去。她俯靠着窗棂站在那里，忽然一个震耳欲聋的爆炸声飞来，比她前几天听到过的大炮声都要响得多。天空被巨大的火焰撕裂了。接着又是几声巨响。大地震撼着，她头上的窗玻璃被震碎了，纷纷落在周围。<p>一声又一声震耳的爆炸声不断传来，世界变成了一个充满喧声、火焰和浑身颤抖的地狱。火星汇成一股股激流蹿入天空，然后缓缓地、懒懒地穿过血红的烟云降落下来。这时她仿佛听到隔壁房里无力的呼唤声，但是她不去管它。她现在没有工夫去顾媚兰了。现在除了恐惧，那种如她所见的火焰般迅速流遍全身血脉的恐惧，再也没别的东西要顾及的了。她像一个吓得发疯的孩子，要把自己的头钻进母亲怀里，躲避眼前的情景。如果她是在家里，跟母亲一起，那多好埃.</p>从这些惊心动魄的响声中她听到另一种声音，一种三步并作一步惊惶地奔上楼来的脚步声，同时还听到一个像迷路的猎狗狂叫的声音。百里茜冲进来了，她奔到思嘉跟前，像要把骨头也捏碎似的。一把紧紧地抓住她的胳臂。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“The Yankees—” cried Scarlett.
<p>“No’m, its our gempmums!” yelled Prissy between breaths, digging her nails deeper into Scarlett’s arm. “Dey’s buhnin’ de foun’ry an’ de ahmy supply depots an’ de wa’houses an’, fo’ Gawd, Miss Scarlett, dey done set off dem sebenty freight cahs of cannon balls an’ gunpowder an’, Jesus, we’s all gwine ter buhn up!”</p>She began yelping again shrilly and pinched Scarlett so hard she cried out in pain and fury and shook off her hand.<p>The Yankees hadn’t come yet! There was still time to get away! She rallied her frightened forces together.</p>“If I don’t get a hold on myself,” she thought, “I’ll be squalling like a scalded cat!” and the sight of Prissy’s abject terror helped steady her. She took her by the shoulders and shook her.
</div>
  <div class="right">“北方佬--"思嘉首先嚷起来。<p>“不，太太。是咱们自己人！"百里茜上气不接下气地喊着，指甲在思嘉的胳臂上掐得更深了。"他们在烧铁厂和军需站和仓库，还有，上帝，思嘉小姐，他们还把七十卡车的大炮炮弹和火药爆炸了，而且，耶稣，咱们都会被烧光呢！"</p>百里茜又尖叫起来，一面紧紧抓住思嘉的手臂，使她又痛又恼，忍不住要哭了。最后思嘉使劲甩掉她的那只手。<p>还来得及逃跑呀！原来北方佬还没来呢！于是她把惊散了的全身力气重整起来。她想：“如果我不能控制住自己，我就会像只烫坏了的猫儿似的拼命号叫了！”</p>同时百里茜那副可怜的惶恐相也帮助着她镇定下来，她抓住百里茜的肩膀使劲摇晃。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Shut up that racket and talk sense. The Yankees haven’t come, you fool! Did you see Captain Butler? What did he say? Is he coming?”
<p>Prissy ceased her yelling but her teeth chattered.</p>“Yas’m, Ah finely foun’ him. In a bahroom, lak you told me. He—”
<p>“Never mind where you found him. Is he coming? Did you tell him to bring his horse?”</p>“Lawd, Miss Scarlett, he say our gempmums done tuck his hawse an’ cah’ige fer a amberlance.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“还是谈正经的吧。别管那些乱哄哄的事了，北方佬还没来呢，你这傻瓜！你见到巴特勒船长了吗？他是怎么说的？他会不会来？"<p>百里茜不再号叫了，但是她的牙床还在打颤。</p>“是的，太太。俺后来找到他。像你吩咐的，在一个酒吧间。他--”<p>“他会来吗？别管在哪里找到的。你告诉他要把马带来吗？”</p>“上帝，思嘉小姐，他说咱们的军队把他的马和马车拉去当救护车了。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Dear God in Heaven!”
<p>“But he comin’—”</p>“What did he say?”
<p>Prissy had recovered her breath and a small measure of control but her eyes still rolled.</p>“Well’m, lak you tole me, Ah foun’ him in a bahroom. Ah stood outside an’ yell fer him an’ he come out. An’ ter-reckly he see me an’ Ah starts tell him, de sojers tech off a sto’ house down Decatur Street an’ it flame up an’ he say Come on an’ he grab me an’ we runs ter Fibe Points an’ he say den: What now? Talk fas’. An’ Ah say you say, Cap’n Butler, come quick an’ bring yo’ hawse an’ cah’ige. Miss Melly done had a chile an’ you is bustin’ ter get outer town. An’ he say: Where all she studyin’ ‘bout goin’? An’ Ah say: Ah doan know, suh, but you is boun’ ter go fo’ de Yankees gits hyah an’ wants him ter go wid you. An’ he laugh an’ say dey done tuck his hawse.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“啊，我的天啊！”<p>“不过，他会来--”</p>“他怎么说的？"<p>这时百里茜不太喘了，已能稍稍控制自己，但她的两个眼珠子还在紧张地转动。</p>“是这样，太太，正像你说的，俺在一家酒吧间找到了他。俺站在外面喊他，他就出来了。他奇怪地看着俺，俺刚要跟他说话时，大兵就把迪凯特街那头的一家妻子拆倒并放弃火来。他说来吧，就一把拽着俺跑到五点镇。后来他说：什么事？快讲。俺说你说的，巴特勒船长，请赶快来，带着你的马和马车来。媚兰小姐生了个娃娃，思嘉小姐急着要离开这个城市。他说，她打算到哪里去呀？俺说，俺不知道，先生，不过你一定得去，因为北方佬就要来了，要他陪你一起走。他笑着说他们把他的马拉走了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett’s heart went leaden as the last hope left her. Fool that she was, why hadn’t she thought that the retreating army would naturally take every vehicle and animal left in the city? For a moment she was too stunned to hear what Prissy was saying but she pulled herself together to hear the rest of the story.
<p>“An’ den he say, Tell Miss Scarlett ter res’ easy. Ah’ll steal her a hawse outer de ahmy crall effen dey’s ary one lef. An’ he say, Ah done stole hawses befo’ dis night. Tell her Ah git her a hawse effen Ah gits shot fer it. Den ‘he laugh agin an’ say, Cut an’ run home. An’ befo’ Ah gits started Ker-bloom! Off goes a noise an’ Ah lak ter drap in mah tracks an’ he tell me twarnt nuthin’ but de ammernition our gempmums blowin’ up so’s de Yankees don’t git it an’—”</p>“He is coming? He’s going to bring a horse?”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉的心情沉重起来，觉得最后一线希望也消失了。她真傻呀，干吗没有想到军队撤退时必然会把留在城里的所有车辆和骡马都拉走呢？她一时吓得目瞪口呆，也没听见百里茜还在说些什么，不过她很快又恢复过来，继续听下半截的故事。<p>“后来他说，告诉思嘉小姐，叫她放心吧。我要到军队里去替她偷骑马来，哪怕只剩下一匹也好。他还说，在这以前我就偷过马呢。告诉她，我哪怕丢了性命也要给她弄骑马来。后来他又笑着说，赶快回家去吧。可是俺刚要动身，就普通一声响起来了！俺吓得几乎倒下了，这时他说这没有什么，只不过咱们自己人把火药炸了，免得落到北方佬手里，还有--”</p>“他会来吗？他在设法弄一骑马来？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“So he say.”
<p>She drew a long breath of relief. If there was any way of getting a horse, Rhett Butler would get one. A smart man, Rhett. She would forgive him anything if he got them out of this mess. Escape! And with Rhett she would have no fear. Rhett would protect them. Thank God for Rhett! With safety in view she turned practical.</p>“Wake Wade up and dress him and pack some clothes for all of us. Put them in the small trunk. And don’t tell Miss Mellie we’re going. Not yet. But wrap the baby in a couple of thick towels and be sure and pack his clothes.”
<p>Prissy still clung to her skirts and hardly anything showed in her eyes except the whites. Scarlett gave her a shove and loosened her grip.</p>“Hurry,” she cried, and Prissy went off like a rabbit.
</div>
  <div class="right">“他是这么说的。”<p>她长长地舒了口气，觉得轻松了些。瑞德是个能干的人，只要还有办法弄到一骑马，瑞德.巴特勒是一定会弄到的。要是他把她们从这片混乱中救出去了，她就饶恕他一切的过错。逃跑呀！只要跟瑞德在一起，她就什么也不怕了。瑞德会保护她们。感谢上帝赐予了这个瑞德啊！她现在纯粹从安全着眼，变得很实际了。</p>“把韦德叫醒，给他穿好衣裳，替我们打点一包常用的衣裳。把它们装进箱子。别告诉媚兰我们要走了。还不到时候呢。不过要用两条厚毛巾小心地把婴儿裹好，把他的衣服也包起来。"<p>百里茜还是拉着她的裙子不放，她除了翻白眼没有一点表情。思嘉推她一把，把她那紧抓着的手摆脱掉。</p>“快去，"她喊道。这时百里茜才像兔子似的悄悄走开了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett knew she should go in and quiet Melanie’s fear, knew Melanie must be frightened out of her senses by the thunderous noises that continued unabated and the glare that lighted the sky. It looked and sounded like the end of the world.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉知道她应当进屋去安慰安慰媚兰，知道媚兰一定被连续不断的轰轰巨响和映红了整个天空火光吓昏了。那光景简直就像世界的末日到了！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But she could not bring herself to go back into that room just yet. She ran down the stairs with some idea of packing up Miss Pittypat’s china and the little silver she had left when she refugeed to Macon. But when she reached the dining room, her hands were shaking so badly she dropped three plates and shattered them. She ran out onto the porch to listen and back again to the dining room and dropped the silver clattering to the floor. Everything she touched she dropped. In her hurry she slipped on the rag rug and fell to the floor with a jolt but leaped up so quickly she was not even aware of the pain. Upstairs she could hear Prissy galloping about like a wild animal and the sound maddened her, for she was galloping just as aimlessly.</div>
  <div class="right">但是，她此刻还下不了决心回那间屋去。她跑下楼来，有意要把皮蒂姑妈逃往梅肯时留下的那些瓷器和银器收拾一下。可是等她走进饭厅时，她的一双手却哆嗦颤抖起来，把三只碟子掉在地下打碎了。她跑到走廊上细听外面的动静，随即又回到饭厅里，把些银器当啷一声掉在地板上。不知怎的，她碰到什么就掉落什么。她慌慌张张行走时还在旧地毯上滑了一跤，普通跌倒了呢，不过她即刻跳起来，一点也没有感觉到痛。她听得见百里茜在楼上像只野兽似的到处奔跑，那声音使她怕极了，因为她自己也同样在盲目地跑来跑去。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">For the dozenth time, she ran out onto the porch but this time she did not go back to her futile packing. She sat down. It was just impossible to pack anything. Impossible to do anything but sit with hammering heart and wait for Rhett. It seemed hours before he came. At last, far up the road, she heard the protesting screech of unoiled axles and the slow uncertain plodding of hooves. Why didn’t he hurry? Why didn’t he make the horse trot?</div>
  <div class="right">她跑到走廊上去有十来次了，不过这次她绝不再回来打那个费力不讨好的包裹了。要想收拾一点东西简直是不可能的。她在走廊上坐下。除了怀着一颗忐忑不安的心在这里等待瑞德，看来什么也做不成了。可是左等右等，他就是不来。最后，从大路前头很远的地方，她听见一种没有上油的车轴的吱吱嘎嘎和缓慢而隐约不清的得得马蹄声。他干吗不快点走呀？他干吗不鞭打着马跑起来呀？</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The sounds came nearer and she leaped to her feet and called Rhett’s name. Then, she saw him dimly as he climbed down from the seat of a small wagon, heard the clicking of the gate as he came toward her. He came into view and the light of the lamp showed him plainly. His dress was as debonair as if he were going to a ball, well-tailored white linen coat and trousers, embroidered gray watered-silk waistcoat and a hint of ruffle on his shirt bosom. His wide Panama hat was set dashingly on one side of his head and in the belt of his trousers were thrust two ivory-handled, long-barreled dueling pistols. The pockets of his coat sagged heavily with ammunition.</div>
  <div class="right">那声音近了，她一跃而起，呼喊瑞德的名字。然后，她隐约看见他从一辆小货车的座位上爬下来，接着大门喀嚓一声，他朝她走过来了。他来到灯光下，才叫思嘉看清楚了。他穿得整整齐齐，像要去参加跳舞会似的。雪白的亚麻布外衣和裤子熨得笔挺，绣边的灰色水绸背心，衬衫胸口镶着一点点褶边。他那顶宽边巴拿马帽时髦地歪戴在头上，裤腰皮带上插着两支象牙柄的长筒决斗手枪。外衣口袋里塞满了沉甸甸的弹药。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He came up the walk with the springy stride of a savage and his fine head was carried like a pagan prince. The dangers of the night which had driven Scarlett into panic had affected him like an intoxicant. There was a carefully restrained ferocity in his dark face, a ruthlessness which would have frightened her had she the wits to see it.
<p>His black eyes danced as though amused by the whole affair, as though the earth-splitting sounds and the horrid glare were merely things to frighten children. She swayed toward him as he came up the steps, her face white, her green eyes burning.</p>“Good evening,” he said, in his drawling voice, as he removed his hat with a sweeping gesture. “Fine weather we’re having. I hear you’re going to take a trip.”
</div>
  <div class="right">他像个野人似的从走道上轻快地大步走来，漂亮的脑袋微微扬起，神气得像个异教徒王子。那种思嘉下了黑夜的恐怖，却像一贴兴奋剂似的使他显得更强悍了。他那黝黑的脸上有一丝勉强掩饰着的残暴无情的神色，这一点如果思嘉头脑清楚，看出来了是会把她吓倒的。<p>他那对黑眼睛眉飞色舞，仿佛觉得眼前这整个局面倒很有趣，仿佛这震天动地的爆炸声和一派恐怖的火光只不过是吓吓小孩子罢了。他走上台阶时她摇摇晃晃地迎上前去，这时她脸色惨白，那双绿眼睛像在冒火似的。</p>“晚上好，"他拖长音调说，同时刷地一下摘下了帽子。“咱们碰上了好天气啦。我听说你要旅行去呢。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“If you make any jokes, I shall never speak to you again,” she said with quivering voice.
<p>“Don’t tell me you are frightened!” He pretended to be surprised and smiled in a way that made her long to push him backwards down the steep steps.</p>“Yes, I am! I’m frightened to death and if you had the sense God gave a goat, you’d be frightened too. But we haven’t got time to talk. We must get out of here.”
<p>“At your service, Madam. But just where were you figuring on going? I made the trip out here for curiosity, just to see where you were intending to go. You can’t go north or east or south or west The Yankees are all around. There’s just one road out of town which the Yankees haven’t got yet and the army is retreating by that road. And that road won’t be open long. General Steve Lee’s cavalry is fighting a rear-guard action at Rough and Ready to hold it open long enough for the army to get away. If you follow the army down the McDonough road, they’ll take the horse away from you and, while it’s not much of a horse, I did go to a lot of trouble stealing it. Just where are you going?”</p>She stood shaking, listening to his words, hardly hearing them. But at his question she suddenly knew where she was going, knew that all this miserable day she had known where she was going. The only place.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你要是再开玩笑，我就永远不再理睬你了，"她用颤抖的声音说。<p>“你不见得真的被吓坏了吧！"他装出一副吃惊的样子诡秘地微笑着，她真想把他推回到台阶下去。</p>“是的，我害怕得要死，我就是被吓坏了。而且如果你也有上帝给山羊的那点意识，你照样会害怕的。不过咱们没时间闲扯了。咱们必须马上离开这里。”<p>“听你的吩咐，太太。不过你琢磨到哪里去好呢？我是怀着好奇心跑到这儿来的，无非想看看你们打算往哪儿去。你们不能往北也不能往东，不能往南也不能往西。四面八方都有北方佬。只有一条出城的路北方佬还没拿到手。咱们的军队就是由这条路撤退的。可这条路也通不了多久了。史蒂夫.李将军的骑兵正在拉甫雷迪打一场后卫战来维持这条通路，以保证部队撤退，部队一撤完，这条通路也就完了。你如果跟随部队沿麦克藺诺公路走，他们就会把马拉去，这匹马尽管不怎么样，可我是费了不少力气才偷到手的呢。你究竟要到哪里去呀？"</p>听他说了这许多话，她站在那里浑身哆嗦，几乎什么也没听见。不过，经他这一问，她却突然明白地要到哪儿去了，她明白在这悲惨的整整一天里她都是知道要到什么地方去的。那唯一的地方呀！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’m going home,” she said.
<p>“Home? You mean to Tara?”</p>“Yes, yes! To Tara! Oh, Rhett, we must hurry!”
<p>He looked at her as if she had lost her mind.</p>“Tara? God Almighty, Scarlett! Don’t you know they fought all day at Jonesboro? Fought for ten miles up and down the road from Rough and Ready even into the streets of Jonesboro? The Yankees may be all over Tara by now, all over the County. Nobody knows where they are but they’re in that neighborhood. You can’t go home! You can’t go right through the Yankee army!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我要回家去，"她说。<p>“回家？你的意思是回塔拉？”</p>“是的，是的！回塔拉去！啊，瑞德，我们得赶紧走呀！"<p>他瞧着她，好像她神志不清了似的。</p>“塔拉？我的天，思嘉！难道你不知道他们整天在琼斯博罗打吗？就是为了抢夺在拉甫雷迪前后十英里的那段大路打呀，甚至打到琼斯博罗的街上去了。此刻北方佬可能已经占领了整个塔拉，占领整个县了。谁也不清楚他们到了哪里，只知道他们就在那一带。你不能回家！你不能从北方佬军队中间穿过去呀！”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I will go home!” she cried. “I will! I will!”<p>“You little fool,” and his voice was swift and rough. “You can’t go that way. Even if you didn’t run into the Yankees, the woods are full of stragglers and deserters from both armies. And lots of our troops are still re-treating from Jonesboro. They’d take the horse away from you as quickly as the Yankees would. Your only chance is to follow the troops down the McDonough road and pray that they won’t see you in the dark. “You can’t go to Tara. Even if you got there, you’d probably find it burned down. I won’t let you go home. It’s insanity.”
</p>“I will go home!” she cried and her voice broke and rose to a scream. “I will go home! You can’t stop me! I will go home! I want my mother! I’ll kill you if you try to stop me! I will go home!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我一定要回去！"她大喊道。"我一定要！我一定要！”<p>“你这小傻瓜，"他的声音又粗又急。"你不能走那条路嘛。即使你不碰上北方佬，那树林中也到处是双方军队的散兵游勇。而且咱们的许多部队还在陆续从琼斯博罗撤退。他们会像北方佬一样即刻把你的马拉走。你唯一的办法是跟着部队沿麦克诺公路走，上帝保佑，黑夜里他们可能不会看见你。但是你不能到塔拉去。即使你到了那里，你也很可能会发现它已经被烧光了。那样做简直是发疯。我不让你回家去。”</p>“我一定要回去！"她大声嚷着，嗓子高得尖叫起来了。“你不能阻拦我！我一定要回去！我要回去！我要我的母亲！你要是阻拦我，我就杀了你！我要回去！"</div></div>

  <div class="left">Tears of fright and hysteria streamed down her face as she finally gave way under the long strain. She beat on his chest with her fists and screamed again: “I will! I will! If I have to walk every step of the way!”
<p>Suddenly she was in his arms, her wet cheek against the starched ruffle of his shirt, her beating hands stilled against him. His hands caressed her tumbled hair gently, soothingly, and his voice was gentle too. So gentle, so quiet, so devoid of mockery, it did not seem Rhett Butler’s voice at all but the voice of some kind strong stranger who smelled of brandy and tobacco and horses, comforting smells because they reminded her of Gerald.</p>“There, there, darling,” he said softly. “Don’t cry. You shall go home, my brave little girl. You shall go home. Don’t cry.”
</div>
  <div class="right">恐惧和歇斯底里的眼泪从她脸上淌下来，她在长时间紧张的刺激下终于忍不住了。她挥舞着拳头猛击他的胸部，一面继续尖叫：“我要！我要！哪怕得一步步走回去也行！"<p>她突然被他抱在怀里了，她那泪淋淋的胸脸紧贴在他胸前浆过的衬衫褶边上，那捶击他的两个拳头也安静地搁在那里。他用两手轻柔地、安慰地抚摩着她的一头乱发，他的声音也是柔和的。那么柔和，那么宁静，不带丝毫嘲讽意味，好像根本不是瑞德.巴特勒的声音，而一个温和强壮的陌生人的声音了，这个陌生人满身是白兰地、烟草和马汗味，使思嘉不由得想起自己的父亲来。</p>“好了，好了，亲爱的，"他温柔地说。"别哭，你会回去的，我勇敢的小姑娘。你会回去的。别哭了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She felt something brush her hair and wondered vaguely through her tumult if it were his lips. He was so tender, so infinitely soothing, she longed to stay in his arms forever. With such strong arms about her, surely nothing could harm her.
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a handkerchief and wiped her eyes.</p>“Now, blow your nose like a good child,” he ordered, a glint of a smile in his eyes, “and tell me what to do. We must work fast.”
<p>She blew her nose obediently, still trembling, but she could not think what to tell him to do. Seeing how her lip quivered and her eyes looked up at him helplessly, he took command.</p>“Mrs. Wilkes has had her child? It will be dangerous to move her—dangerous to drive her twenty-five miles in that rickety wagon. We’d better leave her with Mrs. Meade.”
</div>
  <div class="right">她感到什么东西在触弄她的头发，心中微觉骚动，并模糊地意识到那可能是他的嘴唇。他那么温柔，那么令人无限地欣慰，她简直渴望永远在他怀里。他用那么强壮的胳膊搂抱着她，她觉得什么也不用害怕了。<p>他从口袋里摸出一条手绢，替她揩掉脸上的泪水。</p>“来，乖乖地擤擤鼻子，"他用命令的口气说，眼里闪着一丝笑意，"我们得赶快行动了。告诉我该怎么办。”<p>她顺从地擤擤鼻子，身上仍在哆嗦，可是不知要吩咐他干什么。他见她颤抖着嘴唇仰望着说不出话来，便索性自作主张了。</p>“威尔克斯太太已经分娩了？可不能随便动她呀！那可太危险了。要让她坐这辆摇摇晃晃的货车颠簸二十几英里，咱们最好让她跟米德太太一起留下来。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“The Meades aren’t home. I can’t leave her.”
<p>“Very well. Into the wagon she goes. Where is that simple-minded little wench?”</p>“Upstairs packing the trunk.”
<p>“Trunk? You can’t take any trunk in that wagon. It’s almost too small to hold all of you and the wheels are ready to come off with no encouragement. Call her and tell her to get the smallest feather bed in the house and put it in the wagon.”</p>Still Scarlett could not move. He took her arm in a strong grasp and some of the vitality which animated him seemed to flow into her body. If only she could be as cool and casual as he was! He propelled her into the hall but she still stood helplessly looking at him. His lip went down mockingly: “Can this be the heroic young woman who assured me she feared neither God nor man?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我不能丢开她不管。米德夫妇都不在家呢。”<p>“那很好。让她上车去。那个傻乎乎的小妻子哪儿去了？”</p>“在楼上收拾箱子呢。”<p>“箱子？那车上可什么箱子也不能放。车厢很小，能装下你们几个人就不错了，而且轮子随时就可能掉的。叫她一声，让她把屋里最小的那个羽绒床垫拿出来，搬到车上去。"</p>思嘉仍然不能动弹。他紧紧抓住她的胳臂，他那浑身充溢着的活力部分地流注到她身上。她想：要是她也像他这样冷静，什么也不在乎，那就好了！他扶着推着她走进过厅，可是她仍然站在那里可怜巴巴地望着他。他敝着下嘴唇嘲弄地说：“难道这就是那个向我保证既不怕上帝也不怕人的年轻英雄吗？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He suddenly burst into laughter and dropped her arm. Stung, she glared at him, hating him.
<p>“I’m not afraid,” she said.</p>“Yes, you are. In another moment you’ll be in a swoon and I have no smelling salts about me.”
<p>She stamped her foot impotently because she could not think of anything else to do—and without a word picked up the lamp and started up the stairs. He was close behind her and she could hear him laughing softly to himself. That sound stiffened her spine. She went into Wade’s nursery and found him sitting clutched in Prissy’s arms, half dressed, hiccoughing quietly. Prissy was whimpering. The feather tick on Wade’s bed was small and she ordered Prissy to drag it down the stairs and into the wagon. Prissy put down the child and obeyed. Wade followed her down the stairs, his hiccoughs stilled by his interest in the proceedings.</p>“Come,” said Scarlett, turning to Melanie’s door and Rhett followed her, hat in hand.
</div>
  <div class="right">他突然哈哈大笑，同时放开了她的胳臂。她好像被刺痛了似的，瞪大眼睛看着他，心里恨他。<p>“我并不害怕，"她说。</p>“不，你是害怕的。我身边没有带嗅盐呢！再过一会儿你就要晕倒了。"<p>她无可奈何地顿了顿脚，因为她想不出还能采取什么举动--接着便一声不响端起灯来，动身上楼去。他紧紧地跟在她后面，她还听得见他在一路暗笑。这笑声促使她坚强起来。她走进韦德的育儿室，发现他抓住百里茜的胳臂坐在那里，衣服还没有穿好，正在悄悄地打嗝儿。百里茜抽噎着。韦德床上那个羽绒褥套是小的，她叫百里茜把它搬下楼放到车上去。百里茜放下韦德，照她的吩咐去做了。韦德跟着她下楼，由于对眼前的事情感兴趣便不再打嗝儿了。</p>“来吧，"思嘉说着，向媚兰的门口走去，瑞德跟在后面，手里拿着帽子。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Melanie lay quietly with the sheet up to her chin. Her face was deathly white but her eyes, sunken and black circled, were serene. She showed no surprise at the sight of Rhett in her bedroom but seemed to take it as a matter of course. She tried to smile weakly but the smile died before it reached the corners of her mouth.
<p>“We are going home, to Tara,” Scarlett explained rapidly. “The Yankees are coming. Rhett is going to take us. It’s the only way, Melly.”</p>Melanie tried to nod her head feebly and gestured toward the baby. Scarlett picked up the small baby and wrapped him hastily in a thick towel. Rhett stepped to the bed.
</div>
  <div class="right">媚兰静静地躺在那里，被单一直盖到下巴底下。她的脸色惨白得可怕，但那两只深陷的带黑圈的眼睛却是安祥的。她瞧见瑞德来到她的卧室时并不显得惊讶，倒好像那完全是理所当然的事。她试着微微地笑了笑，可是这笑容还没来到嘴角就消失了。<p>“我们要回家了，到塔拉去，"思嘉连忙向她说明。"北方佬很快就会来。瑞德准备带我们走。这是唯一的办法，媚兰。”</p>媚兰无力地点点头，又向婴儿做了个手势。思嘉抱起那小娃娃，用条厚毛巾迅速把他包好。这时瑞德来到床边。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’ll try not to hurt you,” he said quietly, tucking the sheet about her. “See if you can put your arms around my neck.”
<p>Melanie tried but they fell back weakly. He bent, slipped an arm under her shoulders and another across her knees and lifted her gently. She did not cry out but Scarlett saw her bite her lip and go even whiter. Scarlett held the lamp high for Rhett to see and started toward the door when Melanie made a feeble gesture toward the wall.</p>“What is it?” Rhett asked softly.
<p>“Please,” Melanie whispered, trying to point. “Charles.”</p>Rhett looked down at her as if he thought her delirious but Scarlett understood and was irritated. She knew Melanie wanted the daguerreotype of Charles which hung on the wall below his sword and pistol.
</div>
  <div class="right">“我会当心不让你难受的，"他悄悄地说，一面将被单卷起来裹着她的身子。”请试试能不能抱住我的头颈。"<p>媚兰试了试，但两只胳臂无力地垂下来了。他弯着腰，将一只手臂伸过去托起她的肩膀，另一只抱住她的两个膝弯，轻轻地把她托起来。她没有喊叫，但思嘉看见她咬紧嘴唇，脸色也更加惨白了。思嘉高举起灯盏照着瑞德向门口走去。这时媚兰朝墙壁做了无力的手势。</p>“要什么？”瑞德轻轻问道。<p>“请你，"媚兰像耳语似地，一面试着用手指指，"查尔斯。"</p>瑞德低头看着她，好像觉得她神志不清了，但思嘉明白了她的意思，有点不高兴了。她知道媚兰要的是查尔斯的照片，它挂在墙上他的军刀和手枪下面。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Please,” Melanie whispered again, “the sword.”
<p>“Oh, all right,” said Scarlett and, after she had lighted Rhett’s careful way down the steps, she went back and unhooked the sword and pistol belts. It would be awkward, carrying them as well as the baby and the lamp. That was just like Melanie, not to be at all bothered over nearly dying and having the Yankees at her heels but to worry about Charles’ things.</p>As she took down the daguerreotype, she caught a glimpse of Charles’ face. His large brown eyes met hers and she stopped for a moment to look at the picture curiously. This man had been her husband, had lain beside her for a few nights, had given her a child with eyes as soft and brown as his. And she could hardly remember him.
</div>
  <div class="right">“请你，"媚兰又耳语说，"那军刀。”<p>“唔，好的，"思嘉说。她照着瑞德小心地走下楼梯以后，又回去把那军刀和手枪连同皮带都取下。要是拿着这些东西还要抱着婴儿，同时又端着灯盏，那样子会很狼狈。那媚兰，她一点不为自己濒临死亡和后面紧跟着的北方而着急，却一心挂念着查尔斯的遗物。</p>她取下相平时偶尔瞧了一眼查尔斯的面容。他那双褐色大眼睛跟她的眼光碰上了，这时她好奇地将照片端详了一会。这个男人曾经是她的丈夫，曾经跟她并头睡过几个晚上，让她生了个也像他那样有一对温柔的褐色眼睛的孩子。可是她几乎不记得他了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The child in her arms waved small fists and mewed softly and she looked down at him. For the first time, she realized that this was Ashley’s baby and suddenly wished with all the strength left in her that he were her baby, hers and Ashley’s.
<p>Prissy came bounding up the stairs and Scarlett handed the child to her. They went hastily down, the lamp throwing uncertain shadows on the wall. In the hall, Scarlett saw a bonnet and put it on hurriedly, tying the ribbons under her chin. It was Melanie’s black mourning bonnet and it did not fit Scarlett’s head but she could not recall where she had put her own bonnet.</p>She went out of the house and down the front steps, carrying the lamp and trying to keep the saber from banging against her legs. Melanie lay full length in the back of the wagon, and, beside her, were Wade and the towel-swathed baby. Prissy climbed in and took the baby in her arms.
</div>
  <div class="right">婴儿在她怀里挥动小小的拳头，像只小猫似的轻轻地叫着，她低头看着他。她这才初次意识到这是艾希礼的孩子，并且突然用她身上剩余的全部力量期望他是她的婴儿，她和艾希礼的.<p>百里茜连蹦带跳跑上楼来，思嘉把孩子递给她。她们赶快下楼，一路上灯光向墙壁投下摇曳不定的影子。到了过厅里，思嘉看见一顶帽子，便急忙戴上，在下巴底下系好带子。这是媚兰的黑色丧帽，对思嘉的头也不合适，可是思嘉记不起自己的帽子放在哪儿了。</p>她走出门外，一路擎着灯，下了屋前的台阶，同时设法不让那把军刀碰腿。媚兰直挺挺地躺在马车的后座上，她旁边是韦德和毛巾裹着的婴儿。百里茜爬进来把婴儿抱在怀里。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low. The wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make them come off. She took one look at the horse and her heart sank. He was a small emaciated animal and he stood with his head dispiritedly low, almost between his forelegs. His back was raw with sores and harness galls and he breathed as no sound horse should.
<p>“Not much of an animal, is it?” grinned Rhett. “Looks like he’ll die in the shafts. But he’s the best I could do. Some day I’ll tell you with embellishments just where and how I stole him and how narrowly I missed getting shot. Nothing but my devotion to you would make me, at this stage of my career, turn horse thief—and thief of such a horse. Let me help you in.”</p>He took the lamp from her and set it on the ground. The front seat was only a narrow plank across the sides of the wagon. Rhett picked Scarlett up bodily and swung her to it. How wonderful to be a man and as strong as Rhett, she thought, tucking her wide skirts about her. With Rhett beside her, she did not fear anything, neither the fire nor the noise nor the Yankees.
</div>
  <div class="right">车子很小，四周的挡板又很低。车轮向里歪着，似乎一转就会掉的，思嘉朝那骑马匹了一眼，顿时心就沉了。那匹马又小又瘦，没精打采地站在那里，把个脑袋几乎垂到前胯里去了。马背上伤痕累累，连呼吸也显得病恹恹的。<p>“这可不是什么好马，是不是？"瑞德咧嘴笑笑。"就像会死在车辕里似的。不过，这是我能找到的最好的一匹了。有一天我要详详细细告诉你，我是从哪里和怎样把它偷来的，以及我怎样把它偷来的，以及我怎样差一点吃枪子儿了。不为别的，单单出于对你的忠诚，我才在我事业上这个要紧的阶段当上了盗马贼--偷到了这样一匹宝贝马。好，让我扶你上车。"</p>他从她手里接过灯来，放在地上。马车前座仅仅是横跨在两旁档板上的一条窄木板。瑞德将思嘉的身子一把抱起来，放到那块木板上。思嘉暗想，做一个像瑞德这样强壮的男人多好埃她把宽大的裙子塞大腿底下，端端正正坐好。如今有了瑞德在身边，她什么也不害怕，那爆炸声，无论那火光，乃至北方佬，都不怕了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He climbed onto the seat beside her and picked up the reins.
<p>“Oh, wait!” she cried. “I forgot to lock the front door.”</p>He burst into a roar of laughter and slapped the reins upon the horse’s back.
<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>“At you—locking the Yankees out,” he said and the horse started off, slowly, reluctantly. The lamp on the sidewalk burned on, making a tiny yellow circle of light which grew smaller and smaller as they moved away.
</div>
  <div class="right">他爬上车来，坐在思嘉旁边的座位上，然后提起缰绳。<p>“啊，等等！"她惊叫。"我忘记锁前面的大门了！"</p>他顿时哈哈大笑起来，一面抖动缰绳击打着马背。<p>“你笑什么？”</p>“笑你呀--你要把北方佬锁在大门外呢！"他说着，马已经慢悠悠地、很不情愿地向前走动了。那盏放在人行道上的灯继续照着，它散布的那个淡黄色的光圈愈来愈小，他们已去远了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Rhett turned the horse’s slow feet westward from Peachtree and the wobbling wagon jounced into the rutty lane with a violence that wrenched an abruptly stilled moan from Melanie. Dark trees interlaced above their heads, dark silent houses loomed up on either side and the white palings of fences gleamed faintly like a row of tombstones. The narrow street was a dim tunnel, but faintly through the thick leafy ceiling the hideous red glow of the sky penetrated and shadows chased one another down the dark way like mad ghosts. The smell of smoke came stronger and stronger, and on the wings of the hot breeze came a pandemonium of sound from the center of town, yells, the dull rumbling of heavy army wagons and the steady tramp of marching feet. As Rhett jerked the horse’s head and turned him into another street, another deafening explosion tore the air and a monstrous skyrocket of flame and smoke shot up in the west.</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德赶着那匹慢腾腾的马从桃树街向西拐，马车摇摇晃晃地走上一条满是车辙的小道，猛地一颠把媚兰闷住的一声呻吟打断了。他们头上是交错遮盖的黑糊糊的树枝，两旁是在黑暗中影影绰绰呈现的寂静的房屋，以及像一排墓碑般隐隐发光的白篱笆木桩。这条路又狭又阴暗，像条遂道似的，不过从枝叶茂密的顶篷上隐隐透进来一点点红得可怕的天光，映照得一个接一个的黑影像幽灵似的一路冉冉而过。烟火味愈来愈浓，炽热的微风从市中心带来一片混乱的喧嚣、哭叫和重型军车滞缓的隆隆声响和部队行进时坚定的脚步声。瑞德抖着缰绳让马拐入另一条车道，这时又一声震耳欲聋的爆炸声传来，一团团大如流星烟火般的火焰和黑烟从西边猛地腾起。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">That must be the last of the ammunition trains,” Rhett said calmly. “Why didn’t they get them out this morning, the fools! There was plenty of time. Well, too bad for us. I thought by circling around the center of town, we might avoid the fire and that drunken mob on Decatur Street and get through to the southwest part of town without any danger. But we’ve got to cross Marietta Street somewhere and that explosion was near Marietta Street or I miss my guess.”
<p>“Must—must we go through the fire?” Scarlett quavered.</p>“Not if we hurry,” said Rhett and, springing from the wagon, he disappeared into the darkness of a yard. When he returned he had a small limb of a tree in his hand and he laid it mercilessly across the horse’s galled back. The animal broke into a shambling trot, his breath panting and labored, and the wagon swayed forward with a jolt that threw them about like popcorn in a popper. The baby wailed, and Prissy and Wade cried out as they bruised themselves against the sides of the wagon. But from Melanie there was no sound.
</div>
  <div class="right">“那一定是最后一列军火车了，"瑞德平静地说。"他们为什么没在今天早晨运出去啊，这些笨蛋！那时还有的是时间嘛。现在可苦了我们了。我本来想走过市中心，我们就可以避开大火和迪凯特街上那些暴民，平平安安到达西南市区。可是我们必须在什么地方横过马里塔大街才行，而爆炸就发生在马里塔大街附近，除非我估计错了。”<p>“我们--我们非得通过大火区吗？”思嘉战战兢兢地问。</p>“还来得及避免，要是我们赶快跑，"瑞德说着，便突然从车上跑下去，消失在一座黑暗的庭院里了。他回来时手里拿着一根小小的树枝，用它狠狠地向伤痕累累的马背上抽打。那畜生只得蹒跚地小跑起来，气喘吁吁，跑得十分吃力，马车也一路摇晃着，颠簸着，车里的人像爆玉米花似的来回晃荡。这时婴儿在啼哭，百里茜和韦德也因为在马车挡板上碰得鼻脸肿而号啕大哭，可是媚兰却一声不响。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As they neared Marietta Street, the trees thinned out and the tall flames roaring up above the buildings threw street and houses into a glare of light brighter than day, casting monstrous shadows that twisted as wildly as torn sails flapping in a gale on a sinking ship.</div>
  <div class="right">他们驶近马里塔大街时，两旁的树木稀疏，高高的火焰在建筑物上呼啸而起，把街道和房屋卷入亮如白昼的熊熊火光中，投掷着一个个巨大的像沉船上的破帆在大风中疯狂旋转的暗影。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett’s teeth chattered but so great was her terror she was not even aware of it. She was cold and she shivered, even though the heat of the flames was already hot against their faces. This was hell and she was in it and, if she could only have conquered her shaking knees, she would have leaped from the wagon and run screaming back the dark road they had come, back to the refuge of Miss Pittypat’s house. She shrank closer to Rhett, took his arm in fingers that trembled and looked up at him for words, for comfort, for something reassuring. In the unholy crimson glow that bathed them, his dark profile stood out as clearly as the head on an ancient coin, beautiful, cruel and decadent. At her touch he turned to her, his eyes gleaming with a light as frightening as the fire. To Scarlett, he seemed as exhilarated and contemptuous as if he got strong pleasure from the situation, as if he welcomed the inferno they were approaching.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉的牙齿在格格地打战，但是她害怕得要命，连自己也不觉得了。她在发冷，浑身哆嗦，连那几乎烧到脸上的大火也不起任何作用了。这简直是地狱，她已经陷在里面，要是她还能支配自己颤抖的膝盖，她就会跑下车尖叫着从刚才来的那条黑路上奔回去，回到皮蒂姑妈的房子里去躲起来了。她畏缩地向瑞德靠得更紧，用发抖的双手抓住他的胳臂，仰望着他，希望他能说点什么，给她一点信心，给她一点安慰。他那黝黑的侧影被邪恶的红光映照得十分鲜明，就像古钱上铸造的一个头像似的，那样美丽、残忍而带有颓废色彩。他在她的触摸下回过头来，眼里闪着烈火般吓人的光辉。在思嘉看来，他显得又快活又轻蔑，仿佛对当前的局面感到极大的乐趣似的，仿佛他十分喜欢他们所面对的这个人间地狱。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Here,” he said, laying a hand on one of the long-barreled pistols in his belt. “If anyone, black or white, comes up on your side of the wagon and tries to lay hand on the horse, shoot him and we’ll ask questions later. But for God’s sake, don’t shoot the nag in your excitement.”
<p>“I—I have a pistol,” she whispered, clutching the weapon in her lap, perfectly certain that if death stared her in the face, she would be too frightened to pull the trigger.</p>“You have? Where did you get it?”<p>“It’s Charles’.”</p>“Charles?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“这儿，"他伸手摸摸皮带上的一支长筒手枪。“如果有人，无论黑人白人，只要他走到你那边想抓这骑马，你就开枪把他毙了，以后再讲道理。不过，请千万不要一时激动把这匹宝贝马给打死了。”<p>“我--我也有一支手枪，"她小声说，一面抓住裙兜里的那件武器，但几乎完全相信，一旦死神来到面前，她是会吓得不敢扣扳机的。</p>“你真有？哪儿来的？”<div>“是查尔斯的。”</div>“查尔斯？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes, Charles—my husband.”
<p>“Did you ever really have a husband, my dear?” he whispered and laughed softly.</p>If he would only be serious! If he would only hurry!
<p>“How do you suppose I got my boy?” she cried fiercely.</p>“Oh, there are other ways than husbands—”
<p>“Will you hush and hurry?”</p>But he drew rein abruptly, almost at Marietta Street, in the shadow of a warehouse not yet touched by the flames.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的，查尔斯--我的丈夫。”<p>“你难道真的有过丈夫吗，亲爱的？"他低声说，同时轻轻地笑着。</p>他要是赶快一点就好了！他要是认真一点就好了！<p>“那你说我怎么会有了孩子呢？"她恶狠狠地嚷道。</p>“唔，还有别的办法嘛，不一定要丈夫。”<p>“闭住你这张嘴，快点儿跑好不好？”</p>但是他突然勒住缰绳，因为已快到马里塔大街，马车在一家还没烧到的仓库旁边停住了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Hurry!” It was the only word in her mind. Hurry! Hurry!
<p>“Soldiers,” he said.</p>The detachment came down Marietta Street, between the burning buildings, walking at route step, tiredly, rifles held any way, heads down, too weary to hurry, too weary to care if timbers were crashing to right and left and smoke billowing about them. They were all ragged, so ragged that between officers and men there were no distinguishing insignia except here and there a torn hat brim pinned up with a wreathed “C.S.A.” Many were barefooted and here and there a dirty bandage wrapped a head or arm. They went past, looking neither to left nor right, so silent that had it not been for the steady tramp of feet they might all have been ghosts.
</div>
  <div class="right">“赶快啊！"这是她心里唯一的一句话，赶快啊！赶快啊！<p>“有大兵呢，"他说。</p>在两旁燃烧的建筑物当中，一队士兵迈着行军的步伐沿马里塔大街走来，他们显得很疲乏，低着头，步枪随便背在身上，看来已无力快跑，连左右两边不时倒塌的梁柱和周围滚滚的浓烟也不在乎了。他们都穿得破破烂烂，已很难辩认出军官和士兵来，只不过偶尔看到有的破军帽上还别着饰有花环的"联盟军"标志。许多人赤着脚，有的头上或胳臂上缠着肮脏的绷带。他们陆续走过，谁也不向两旁看一眼，而且一路上都默默无言，就像一队幽灵，要不是那坚定的脚步声。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Take a good look at them,” came Rhett’s gibing voice, “so you can tell your grandchildren you saw the rear guard of the Glorious Cause in retreat.”
<p>Suddenly she hated him, hated him with a strength that momentarily overpowered her fear, made it seem petty and small. She knew her safety and that of the others in the back of the wagon depended on him and him alone, but she hated him for his sneering at those ragged ranks. She thought of Charles who was dead and Ashley who might be dead and all the gay and gallant young men who were rotting in shallow graves and she forgot that she, too, had once thought them fools. She could not speak, but hatred and disgust burned in her eyes as she stared at him fiercely.</p>As the last of the soldiers were passing, a small figure in the rear rank, his rifle butt dragging the ground, wavered, stopped and stared after the others with a dirty face so dulled by fatigue he looked like a sleepwalker. He was as small as Scarlett, so small his rifle was almost as tall as he was, and his grime-smeared face was unbearded. Sixteen at the most, thought Scarlett irrelevantly, must be one of the Home Guard or a runaway schoolboy.
</div>
  <div class="right">“仔细瞧瞧他们吧，"瑞德用嘲弄的口吻说，"这样你将来就能告诉你的孙子们，你见过这光荣事业的后卫军撤退时的情景。"<p>她顿时恨起他来，对他的恨暂时超过了恐惧，她甚至觉得恐惧已是次要的和渺小的了。她明白她自己和马车后座里的几个人的安全都要依靠他，而且只能依靠他。可是她恨他对待那些褴褛队伍的嘲笑态度。她想起已故的查尔斯和可能已不在人世的艾希礼，以及所有的那些正在浅浅的坟里腐烂的快活英俊的青年，并且忘记了她自己也曾经把他们当作傻瓜。她说不出话来，但她恶狠狠地盯着他时，眼睛里燃烧着憎恨和厌恶。</p>最后一名士兵走过来了，那是个后排的小个儿，他的枪托一路在地上拖着，他摇摇晃晃，停下来凝望着前面的伙伴；他那张肮脏的脸像个梦游人的。由于疲倦而显得毫无表情，他像思嘉一样矮小，矮得几乎跟他的枪一般高，而他那肮脏的脸上还一点没有胡须呢。看来至多１６岁，思嘉胡乱地想，一定是从乡团来的，说不定还是个逃跑的小学生。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As she watched, the boy’s knees buckled slowly and he went down in the dust. Without a word, two men fell out of the last rank and walked back to him. One, a tall spare man with a black beard that hung to his belt, silently handed his own rifle and that of the boy to the other. Then, stooping, he jerked the boy to his shoulders with an ease that looked like sleight of hand. He started off slowly after the retreating column, his shoulders bowed under the weight, while the boy, weak, infuriated like a child teased by its elders, screamed out: Put me down, damn you! Put me down! I can walk!”
<p>The bearded man said nothing and plodded on out of sight around the bend of the road.</p>Rhett sat still, the reins lax in his hands, looking after them, a curious moody look on his swarthy face. Then, there was a crash of falling timbers near by and Scarlett saw a thin tongue of flame lick up over the roof of the warehouse in whose sheltering shadow they sat. Then pennons and battle flags of flame flared triumphantly to the sky above them. Smoke burnt her nostrils and Wade and Prissy began coughing. The baby made soft sneezing sounds.
</div>
  <div class="right">她望着望着，那孩子的两个膝头便慢慢打弯，最后倒在尘土中了。后排有两个人一声不响地走回来，回到孩子身边，其中一人是个黑胡子老长的瘦高个儿，他把手中的枪连同孩子提起来扛到肩上，那轻而易举的姿态就像是专干这一行的老手。他跟在撤退的队伍后面缓缓地走着，两只肩膀因横扛着那个孩子而稍稍下垂，可那孩子虽然虚弱，却像一个被年纪大的人惹得生气的顽童尖叫起来：“你这该死的家伙！放下我，放下我！我能走！"<p>那个长胡子毫不理睬，扛着他继续往前走，很快便在大路拐弯处消失了。</p>瑞德静静地坐在那里看着前面那支队伍，手里的缰绳也放松了。黝黑的脸上流露出好奇的神情。这时，随着的旁边房梁倒塌的响声，思嘉看见一股火苗在他们身边那个仓库的屋顶上升起。接着，像大大小小的旗帜般的火焰兴高采烈地蹿上天空。浓烟刺痛了她的鼻孔，韦德和百里茜已开始咳嗽起来，连那小小的婴儿也在轻轻地打喷嚏。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, name of God, Rhett! Are you crazy? Hurry! Hurry!”
<p>Rhett made no reply but brought the tree limb down on the horse’s back with a cruel force that made the animal leap forward. With all the speed the horse could summon, they jolted and bounced across Marietta Street. Ahead of them was a tunnel of fire where buildings were blaring on either side of the short, narrow street that led down to the railroad tracks. They plunged into it. A glare brighter than a dozen suns dazzled their eyes, scorching heat seared their skins and the roaring, crackling and crashing beat upon their ears in painful waves. For an eternity, it seemed, they were in the midst of flaming torment and then abruptly they were in semidarkness again.</p>As they dashed down the street and bumped over the railroad tracks, Rhett applied the whip automatically. His face looked set and absent, as though he had forgotten where he was. His broad shoulders were hunched forward and his chin jutted out as though the thoughts in his mind were not pleasant. The heat of the fire made sweat stream down his forehead and cheeks but he did not wipe it off.
</div>
  <div class="right">“啊，我的上帝，瑞德！你发疯了？赶快走呀，赶快走呀！"<p>瑞德没有搭腔，只是拿那根树枝在马背上狠狠地抽了一下，让那畜生吓得跳起来往前一蹿，随即用尽可能高的速度载着他们摇摇晃晃地横过了马里塔大街。他们前面是一条火的隧道，两旁的建筑物在熊熊燃烧--这就是那条通往铁路的窄窄的短街。他们闯进了这条隧_道。一片比十几个太阳还要亮的火光使他们头晕目眩，皮肤痛难忍，同时那呼啸声、爆炸声和倒塌也震得他们一阵耳鸣心悸，惶恐不安。他们觉得在这火的激流中熬得没完没了似的，然后才突然又进入半明半暗的夜色里。</p>他们匆匆驶离大街，越过铁路，一路上瑞德始终在挥着鞭子，他的面容是镇定而冷静，仿佛忘记自己是在什么地方了。他那宽阔的肩背向前躬着，下巴翘起来，似乎在想什么不愉快的心事。炽热的火光使他满头满脸汗水流个不停，但是他从没擦过。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">They pulled into a side street, then another, then turned and twisted from one narrow street to another until Scarlett completely lost her bearings and the roaring of the flames died behind them. Still Rhett did not speak. He only laid on the whip with regularity. The red glow in the sky was fading now and the road became so dark, so frightening, Scarlett would have welcomed words, any words from him, even jeering, insulting words, words that cut. But he did not speak.
<p>Silent or not, she thanked Heaven for the comfort of his presence. It was so good to have a man beside her, to lean close to him and feel the hard swell of his arm and know that he stood between her and unnamable terrors, even though he merely sat there and stared.</p>“Oh, Rhett,” she whispered clasping his arm, “What would we ever have done without you? I’m so glad you aren’t in the army!”
</div>
  <div class="right">他们驶进一条又一条的小巷，然后又拐弯抹角地穿过一条条狭窄的街道，直到思嘉已完全看不出方向，那呼啸的大火也在他们背后渐渐消失了。可瑞德依旧有规律地挥着鞭子。仍旧一言不发。天空的红光此刻在渐渐消隐，道路已变得又黑又吓人，思嘉很希望他能说说话，无论说什么，哪怕是嘲讽的、带侮辱性的，伤人自尊心的也好。可是他一句话也不说。<p>无论他说不说话，她都要感谢上帝，因为他在就是最大的安慰了。有个男人在她身边，让她紧紧地靠着，感觉到他结实牢靠的臂膀，知道他在挡住那不可名状的恐怖使之不来伤害她，哪怕他仅仅坐在这里凝望，也是很值得庆幸的事！</p>“唔，瑞德，"她抓住他的胳臂小声说，"要是没有你，我们会怎么样？我真高兴你没有到军队里去啊！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He turned his head and gave her one look, a look that made her drop his arm and shrink back. There was no mockery in his eyes now. They were naked and there was anger and something like bewilderment in them. His lip curled down and he turned his head away. For a long time they jounced along in a silence unbroken except for the faint wails of the baby and sniffles from Prissy. When she was able to bear the sniffling noise no longer, Scarlett turned and pinched her viciously, causing Prissy to scream in good earnest before she relapsed into frightened silence.
<p>Finally Rhett turned the horse at right angles and after a while they were on a wider, smoother road. The dim shapes of houses grew farther and farther apart and unbroken woods loomed wall-like on either side.</p>“We’re out of town now,” said Rhett briefly, drawing rein, “and on the main road to Rough and Ready.”
</div>
  <div class="right">他回过头来看了她一眼，这一眼可吓得她连忙松开他的胳臂往后退缩。他眼睛里已没有嘲弄的神色，他的目光是赤裸裸的，充满了愤怒和惶惑之情。他咬了咬上嘴唇，随即回过头去。他们颠簸着行驶了好一会，除了有时婴儿哭叫和百里茜在声唏嘘之外，一路上都默无声息。思嘉对百里茜的唏嘘实在已忍无可忍，便狠狠地掐了她一把，她着实尖叫了两声才吓得不再作声了。最后瑞德赶着马向右转了两回，不久便来到一条较宽广平坦的大路上。这时房屋的阴影已离得愈来愈远，而连绵不绝的树林却如墙壁般在两旁隐约出现了。“我们现在已经出城，走上去拉甫雷迪的大路了，"瑞德简单地说，一面把缰绳收紧。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Hurry. Don’t stop!”
<p>“Let the animal breathe a bit.” Then turning to her, he asked slowly: “Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?”</p>“Do what?’
<p>“Do you still want to try to get through to Tara? It’s suicidal. Steve Lee’s cavalry and the Yankee Army are between you and Tara.”</p>Oh, Dear God! Was he going to refuse to take her home, after all she’d gone through this terrible day?
<p>“Oh, yes! Yes! Please, Rhett, let’s hurry. The horse isn’t tired.”</p>“Just a minute. You can’t go down to Jonesboro on this road. You can’t follow the train tracks. They’ve been fighting up and down mere all day from Rough and Ready on south. Do you know any other roads, small wagon roads or lanes that don’t go through Rough and Ready or Jonesboro?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“别再停了！快，”<p>“让这牲口喘口气吧，"瑞德回过头来对她说，接着又慢吞吞地问：“你仍然决定要干这种发疯的事吗？思嘉。”</p>“什么事？”<p>“你还想冒险到塔拉去吗？那是自杀行为。史蒂夫.李的骑兵和北方佬的军队正在你前面阻挡着呢。</p>"啊，我的上帝！在她经历了这可怕一天的种种艰险之后，居然他还想拒绝她的要求，不送她回家去。<p>“啊，是的，是的！瑞德，求求你了，让我们快点走吧。马并不累呢。”</p>“稍等一等。你们不能走这条大路到琼斯博罗去。你们不能沿铁路走。他们成天在南面拉甫雷迪一带激战呢。你知道还有旁的路好走吗？马车路或小路，无需经过拉甫雷迪或琼斯博罗。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, yes,” cried Scarlett in relief. “If we can just get near to Rough and Ready, I know a wagon trace that winds off from the main Jonesboro road and wanders around for miles. Pa and I used to ride it. It comes out right near the Macintosh place and that’s only a mile from Tara.”
<p>“Good. Maybe you can get past Rough and Ready all right. General Steve Lee was there during the afternoon covering the retreat Maybe the Yankees aren’t there yet. Maybe you can get through there, if Steve Lee’s men don’t pick up your horse.”</p>“I can get through?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，有的，"思嘉像得救般地喊道。"只要我们能够到达拉甫雷迪附近。我知道有条马车路可以走开琼斯博罗大道若干英里过去的。我和爸常常走那里。它是从麦金托什直接过来的，那儿离塔拉只一英里。”<p>“那好，也许你们可以平安通过拉甫雷迪了。史蒂夫.李将军整个下午都在那里掩护撤退，北方佬可能还没有到。也许你们能通过，如果史蒂夫.李将军的部队不把你们的马抢走的话。”</p>“我--我能通过？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes, you.” His voice was rough.
<p>“But Rhett— You—Aren’t going to take us?”</p>“No. I’m leaving you here.”
<p>She looked around wildly, at the livid sky behind them, at the dark trees on either hand hemming them in like a prison wall, at the frightened figures in the back of the wagon—and finally at him. Had she gone crazy? Was she not hearing right?</p>He was grinning now. She could just see his white teeth in the faint light and the old mockery was back in his eyes.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的，你，"他的口气很干脆。<p>“可是，瑞德--你--难道你不送我们了？”</p>“不。我要在这里跟你们分手了。"<p>她惊惶失措地看看周围，看看身后那灰色的天空，看看左右两旁阴暗茂密得如监狱高墙的树木，看看马车后座上吓呆了的人影--最后才回过头来凝望着他。难道疯了？难道她听不明白？</p>他这时咧嘴笑了。她在朦胧中看得见他那雪白的牙齿和隐藏在他眼光背后的嘲弄意味。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Leaving us? Where—where are you going?”
<p>“I am going, dear girl, with the army.”</p>She sighed with relief and irritation. Why did he joke at this time of all times? Rhett in the army! After all he’d said about stupid fools who were enticed into losing their lives by a roll of drums and brave words from orators—fools who killed themselves that wise men might make money!
<p>“Oh, I could choke you for scaring me so! Let’s get on.”</p>I’m not joking, my dear. And I am hurt, Scarlett that you do not take my gallant sacrifice with better spirit. Where is your patriotism, your love for Our Glorious Cause? Now is your chance to tell me to return with my shield or on it. But, talk fast, for I want time to make a brave speech before departing for the wars.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“跟我们分手？你--你到哪儿去呀？”<p>“我嘛，亲爱的，我到军队里去。”</P>她好像放心而又厌烦地叹了一声。他干吗偏偏在这个时候开玩笑呀？哼，没听他说过，瑞德到军队里去！那些被战鼓声和讲演家的大话所诱惑而断送了性命的人都是傻瓜--牺牲自己来让聪明人赚钱的傻瓜吗？<p>“啊，你把我吓成这样，我恨不得把你掐死呢！咱们快走吧。”</p>“亲爱的，我可不是开玩笑。思嘉，这叫我太伤心了。你居然不理解我勇于牺牲的精神，你的爱国心，你对于我们的光荣事业的忠诚，都到哪里去了呢？现在是你叫我光荣凯旋或马革裹尸而归的最好时机了。你快说呀，因为我没有时间在赴前线参加战斗之前发表激昂慷慨的演说了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">His drawling voice gibed in her ears. He was jeering at her and, somehow, she knew he was jeering at himself too. What was he talking about? Patriotism, shields, brave speeches? It wasn’t possible that he meant what he was saying. It just wasn’t believable that he could talk so blithely of leaving her here on this dark road with a woman who might be dying, a new-born infant, a foolish black wench and a frightened child, leaving her to pilot them through miles of battle fields and stragglers and Yankees and fire and God knows what.
<p>Once, when she was six years old, she had fallen from a tree, flat on her stomach. She could still recall that sickening interval before breath came back into her body. Now, as she looked at Rhett, she felt the same way she had felt then, breathless, stunned, nauseated.</p>“Rhett, you are joking!”
</div>
  <div class="right">他那慢吞吞的声调，在她听来是带讽刺的。他是在讥笑她，甚至她觉得也是在讥笑他自己。他究竟在说些什么呀？什么爱国心，马革裹尸，激昂慷慨的说？他所说的不见得真正是那个意思吧。在这条黑咕隆咚的路上，她身边带着一个濒死的女人、一个新生的婴儿、一个愚蠢的黑人小妻子和一个吓坏的孩子，这时候，他居然如此轻松地提出要离开她，让她独自带他们从这广阔的战尝散兵游勇、北方佬和炮火以及天知道还有什么样的风险中穿过去，这简直是令人难以置信的事！<p>曾经有一次，她六岁的时候，从树上摔下来，脸朝下直挺挺地跌在地上。她至今还记得当时她恢复呼吸以前那片刻之间难受的感觉。现在她瞧着瑞德，内心的感受也完全像当时那样：呼吸停止，不省人事，恶心。</p>“你是在说着玩的，瑞德！”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She grabbed his arm and felt her tears of fright splash down her wrist. He raised her hand and kissed it arily.
<p>“Selfish to the end, aren’t you, my dear? Thinking only of your own precious hide and not of the gallant Confederacy. Think how our troops will be heartened by my eleventh-hour appearance.” There was a malicious tenderness in his voice.</p>“Oh, Rhett,” she wailed, “how can you do this to me? Why are you leaving me?”
<p>“Why?” he laughed jauntily. “Because, perhaps, of the betraying sentimentality that lurks in all of us Southerners. Perhaps—perhaps because I am ashamed. Who knows?”</p>“Ashamed? You should die of shame. To desert us here, alone, helpless—”
</div>
  <div class="right">她拽住他的胳臂，眼泪簌簌地往他的手腕上滴下来。他把她的手举到唇边轻轻地亲了亲。<p>“难道你不是这样吗，自私透了，亲爱的？只顾你自己的宝贵安全，便不管联盟的生死存亡了。试想，由于我在最后时刻出现，咱们的部队会受到多大的鼓舞啊！"他说着，声音中带有一种不怀好意的亲切感。</p>“啊，瑞德，"她哭着说，"你怎么能这样对待我呢？你干吗要丢开我呀？”<p>“怎么，"他快活地笑道。"也许就因为我们所有南方人身上那种叛心理在作祟吧。也许--也许因为我觉得惭愧了。谁知道呢？”</p>“惭愧？你迟早会惭愧死的。把我们丢在这里，无依无靠--”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Dear Scarlett! You aren’t helpless. Anyone as selfish and determined as you are is never helpless. God help the Yankees if they should get you.”
<p>He stepped abruptly down from the wagon and, as she watched him, stunned with bewilderment, he came around to her side of the wagon.</p>“Get out,” he ordered.
</div>
  <div class="right">“你并不是无依无靠呀。亲爱的思嘉！每一个像你这样自私自利而坚决的人是决不会无依无靠的。北方佬要是能抓到你，那才是上帝保佑他们呢。"<p>她惊惶失地望着他，只见他突然跳下马来，走到她这边的马车旁边来。</p>“你下来吧，"他吩咐她。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She stared at him. He reached up roughly, caught her under the arms and swung her to the ground beside him. With a tight grip on her he dragged her several paces away from the wagon. She felt the dust and gravel in her slippers hurting her feet. The still hot darkness wrapped her like a dream.
<p>“I’m not asking you to understand or forgive. I don’t give a damn whether you do either, for I shall never understand or forgive myself for this idiocy. I am annoyed at myself to find that so much quixoticism still lingers in me. But our fair Southland needs every man. Didn’t our brave Governor Brown say just that? Not matter. I’m off to the wars.” He laughed suddenly, a ringing, free laugh that startled the echoes in the dark woods.</p>“ ‘I could not love thee, Dear, so much, loved I not Honour more.’ That’s a pat speech, isn’t it? Certainly better than anything I can think up myself, at the present moment. For I do love you, Scarlett, in spite of what I said that night on the porch last month.”
</div>
  <div class="right">她瞪大眼睛瞧着他。他鲁莽地伸出双臂，把她拦腰抱出来扔在地上。接着他又紧紧拽住将她拖到了离马车好几步的地方。她感到鞋子里的尘土和碎石把她的脚硌痛了。寂静而炎热的黑夜像梦似的包围着她。<p>“我不想要求你了解或宽耍我也毫不在乎你会不会这样，因为我是永远不会了解或宽恕我自己做这种傻事的。我深恨自己身上还残留着这么多不切实际的空想。可是我们美好的南方正需要每个男人去为它献身呢。难道我们勇敢的布朗州长不就是这样说的吗？反正我要上前线去了。没关系。"他忽然大笑起来，笑得那么放肆，那么响亮，连黑暗的树林里都发出了回响。</p>“'我要不是更爱荣誉，亲爱的，我不会这样爱你，'这话很恰当，不是吗？它无疑比我现在自己能想出的任何话都恰当。因为我就是爱你，思嘉,不管上个月的那天夜里我在走廊上说了些什么。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">His drawl was caressing and his hands slid tip her bare arms, warm strong hands. I love you, Scarlett, because we are so much alike, renegades, both of us, dear, and selfish rascals. Neither of us cares a rap if the whole world goes to pot so long as we are safe and comfortable.”
<p>His voice went on in the darkness and she heard words, but they made no sense to her. Her mind was tiredly trying to take in the harsh truth that he was leaving her here to face the Yankees alone. Her mind said: “He’s leaving me. He’s leaving me.” But no emotion stirred.</p>Then his arms went around her waist and shoulders and she felt the hard muscles of his thighs against her body and the buttons of his coat pressing into her breast A warm tide of feeling, bewildering, frightening, swept over her, carrying out of her mind the time and place and circumstances. She felt as limp as a rag doll, warm, weak and helpless, and his supporting arms were so pleasant.
</div>
  <div class="right">他那慢悠悠的声音是温柔的，他的手，那双温柔而强有力的手，向上抚摩着她光着的臂膀。"我爱你，思嘉，因为我们两人那么相像，我们都是叛教者，亲爱的，都是自私自利的无赖。要是整个世界都归于毁灭，我们两人都会一点不在乎的，只要我们自己安全舒适就行了。"<p>他在黑暗中继续说下去，她也听见了，可是压根儿没有听懂。他要把她丢在这里去单独面对那些北方佬呢，她心里正厌烦地试着接受这一冷酷的现实。她心里说：“他要丢开我了，他要丢开我了，"可是这并没有使她激动。</p>后来他用双臂搂住她的肩膀和腰肢，她感到他大腿上坚实的肌肉紧贴在她身上，他外衣的钮扣几乎压进了她的胸脯。一股令人迷惘和惊恐的热潮流遍她的周身，把时间、地点和环境从她的意识中卷走了。她感觉自己像个布娃娃似的瘫软而温顺，娇弱而无所依靠，而他那搂抱的双臂又多么令人惬意啊！</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You don’t want to change your mind about what I said last month? There’s nothing like danger and death to give an added fillip. Be patriotic, Scarlett Think how you would be sending a soldier to his death with beautiful memories.”
<p>He was kissing her now and his mustache tickled her mouth, kissing her with slow, hot lips that were so leisurely as though he had the whole night before him. Charles had never kissed her like this. Never had the kisses of the Tarleton and Calvert boys made her go hot and cold and shaky like this. He bent her body backward and his lips traveled down her throat to where the cameo fastened her basque.</p>“Sweet,” he whispered. “Sweet.”
<p>She saw the wagon dimly in the dark and heard the treble piping of Wade’s voice.</p>“Muvver! Wade fwightened!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你对于我上个月说的那些话不想改变自己的看法吗？没有什么能像危险和死亡那样给人以更大的刺激了。来一点爱国精神吧，思嘉。试想，如果你用美好的记忆送一名士兵去牺牲，那会怎么样啊！"<p>这时他的髭须扎着她的小嘴，他在吻她，他用迟钝而势热的嘴唇吻着，那么不慌不忙，仿佛眼前还有一整天时间似的。查尔斯从来没有这样吻过她。塔尔顿家和卡尔弗特家的几个小伙子的吻，也从来不像这样叫她热一阵冷一阵地浑身颤抖。他将她的身子压向后面仰靠着，他的嘴唇从她喉颈上往下移动，直到那个浮雕宝石锁着她胸衣的地方。</p>“亲爱的，亲爱的，"他低声唤着。<p>她从黑暗中朦胧中瞧见那辆马车，接着又听见韦德刺耳的尖叫声。</p>“妈，韦德害怕！”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Into her swaying, darkened mind, cold sanity came back with a rush and she remembered what she had forgotten for the moment—that she was frightened too, and Rhett was leaving her, leaving her, the damned cad. And on top of it all, he had the consummate gall to stand here in the road and insult her with his infamous proposals. Rage and hate flowed into her and stiffened her spine and with one wrench she tore herself loose from his arms.
<p>“Oh, you cad!” she cried and her mind leaped about, trying to think of worse things to call him, things she had heard Gerald call Mr. Lincoln, the Macintoshes and balky mules, but the words would not come. “You low-down, cowardly, nasty, stinking thing!” And because she could not think of anything crushing enough, she drew back her arm and slapped him across the mouth with all the force she had left. He took a step backward, his hand going to his face.</p>“Ah,” he said quietly and for a moment they stood facing each other in the darkness. Scarlett could hear his heavy breathing, and her own breath came in gasps as if she had been running hard.
</div>
  <div class="right">冷静的理智猛地回到她恍惚的心里，她想起自己一时忘记了的事情--她自己也吓住了，因为瑞德要抛弃她，抛弃她，这该死的流氓！尤其可恶的是，他居然如此大胆，站在大路上提出无耻的要求来侮辱她。愤怒和憎恨在她心头涌起，使她的脊梁挺起来，她用力一扭从他怀抱里挣脱出来。<p>“啊，你这流氓！"她喊着，一面心急如火，想找出更恶毒的话来骂他，找出她听见杰拉尔德骂林肯先生和麦金托什人以及倔犟骡子的那些话来骂他，可是怎么也找不着。"你这下流坯，卑鄙肮脏的臭东西！"同时由于想不出更带侮辱性的手段，她把手抽回来，使出浑身的力气在他嘴巴上打了一巴掌。他向后倒退一步，忙用手抚摸自己的面孔。</p>“哎，"他平静地哼了一声，然后两人面对面地在黑暗中呆立着。她听得见他粗重的呼吸声，仿佛跑得急了似的她自己也在吁吁喘气。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“They were right! Everybody was right! You aren’t a gentleman!”
<p>“My dear girl,” he said, “how inadequate.”</p>She knew he was laughing and the thought goaded her.
<p>“Go on! Go on now! I want you to hurry. I don’t want to ever see you again. I hope a cannon ball lands right on you. I hope it blows you to a million pieces. I—”</p>“Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea. When I’m dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience hurts you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“他们说对了！你不是个上等人！大家都是对的！”<p>“我亲爱的姑娘，"他说，”这么不合适埃"</p>她知道他又在笑了，这刺痛了她。<p>“走吧！现在就走！我要你赶快走。我永远不要再见到你了。我希望一发炮弹正好落到你身上。我希望炮弹把你炸个粉碎。我--”</p>“不用说下去了。我已经大致懂得你的意思。等到我作为牺牲品摆在国家的祭坛上时，我希望你的良心会使你感到内疚。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She heard him laugh as he turned away and walked back toward the wagon. She saw him stand beside it, heard him speak and his voice was changed, courteous and respectful as it always was when he spoke to Melanie.
<p>“Mrs. Wilkes?”</p>Prissy’s frightened voice made answer from the wagon.
<p>“Gawdlmighty. Cap’n Butler! Miss Melly done fainted away back yonder.”</p>“She’s not dead? Is she breathing?”
</div>
  <div class="right">她听见他笑着走开了，便回到马车旁边来。她看见他站在那里，听见他正在说话，而且声音变了，变得那么谦和、恭谨，就像他每次跟媚兰谈话时一样。<p>“威尔克斯太太吗？”</p>百里茜用惊恐的声音从马车里回答。<p>“我的上帝，原来是巴特勒船长呢！媚兰小姐早在那头就晕过去了。”</p>“她还没死吧？还在出气吗？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yassuh, she breathin’.”
<p>“Then she’s probably better off as she is. If she were conscious, I doubt if she could live through all the pain. Take good care of her, Prissy. Here’s a shinplaster for you. Try not to be a bigger fool than you are.”</p>“Yassuh. Thankee suh.”
<p>“Good-by, Scarlett.”</p>She knew he had turned and was facing her but she did not speak. Hate choked all utterance. His feet ground on the pebbles of the road and for a moment she saw his big shoulders looming up in the dark. Then he was gone. She could hear the sound of his feet for a while and then they died away. She came slowly back to the wagon, her knees shaking.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的，先生，她还有气。”<p>“那么，她像现在这样也许还好些。要是她清醒着，我倒担心她经受不了这许多痛苦呢。百里茜。好好照顾她吧，这张钞票给你。可千万不要变得愈来愈傻呀！”</p>“是的，先生。谢谢先生。”<p>“再见，思嘉。"</p>思嘉知道他已转过身来面对着她，可是她不吭声。她恨透他了、一时说不出话来。他的两只脚磨着路上的鹅卵石，有一会儿她还看见他那宽大的肩膀在黑暗中隐隐显现。然后他就走了。她还听得到他的脚步声，但不久便渐渐消失了。她慢慢回到马车旁，两个膝头在不停地打战。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Why had he gone, stepping off into the dark, into the war, into a Cause that was lost, into a world that was mad? Why had he gone, Rhett who loved the pleasures of women and liquor, the comfort of good food and soft beds, the feel of fine linen and good leather, who hated the South and jeered at the fools who fought for it? Now he had set his varnished boots upon a bitter road where hunger tramped with tireless stride and wounds and weariness and heartbreak ran like yelping wolves. And the end of the road was death. He need not have gone. He was safe, rich, comfortable. But he had gone, leaving her alone in a night as black as blindness, with the Yankee Army between her and home.
<p>Now she remembered all the bad names she had wanted to call him but it was too late. She leaned her head against the bowed neck of the horse and cried.</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">他怎么会走了呢，怎么会走进黑暗，走入战争，走向一桩业已失败的事业，走进一个疯狂的世界去呢？他怎么会走啊，瑞德，这个沉湎于女人美酒，追求时髦服饰，讲究吃喝享乐，而又厌恶南方和嘲骂参军打仗的人，怎么会走呀？如今他那双光亮的马靴踏上了苦难的道路，那儿充满了饥饿、疲惫、行军、苦战、创伤、悲痛等等，像无数狂叫的恶狼在等着他，最后的结局就是死亡呢。他是没有必要去的。他安全，富裕，舒适。然而他去了，把她孤零零地抛弃在这漆黑的夜里，前面有北方佬挡着不让她回家去！<p>如今她想了所有她要用来咒骂他的恶言恶语，可是已经晚了。她把头靠在马的弯脖子上，放声痛哭起来。</p></div></div>
