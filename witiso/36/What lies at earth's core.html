<p>What lies at earth's core</p>
<p>We can't journey to the centre of the Earth, but that hasn't stopped us finding out what is down there</p>
<p>By Chris Baraniuk</p>
<p>13 August 2015</p>
<div>
  <p>Humans have been all over the Earth. We've conquered the lands, flown through the air and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean">dived to the deepest trenches in the ocean</a>. We've even been to the Moon. But we've never been to the planet's core.</p>
  <p>We   haven't even come close. The central point of the Earth is over 6,000km   down, and even the outermost part of the core is nearly 3,000 km below   our feet. The deepest hole we've ever created on the surface is the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/EarthSci/people/lidunka/GEOL2014/Geophysics7%20-%20Deep%20Earth/Earth%20Structure.htm">Kola Superdeep Borehole</a> in Russia, and it only goes down a pitiful 12.3 km.</p>
  <p>All the familiar events on Earth also happen close to the surface. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=126475">The lava that spews from volcanoes first melts just a few hundred kilometres down</a>. Even diamonds, which need extreme heat and pressure to form, originate in rocks less than 500km deep.</p>
  <p>What's   down below all that is shrouded in mystery. It seems unfathomable. And   yet, we know a surprising amount about the core. We even have some idea   about how it formed billions of years ago – all without a single   physical sample. This is how the core was revealed.</p>

  </div>
  <p>One good way to start is to think about the mass of the Earth, says <a href="http://www.energy.cam.ac.uk/directory/satr@cam.ac.uk">Simon Redfern</a> of the University of Cambridge in the UK.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Most of the Earth's mass must be located towards the centre of the planet </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We   can estimate Earth's mass by observing the effect of the planet's   gravity on objects at the surface. It turns out that the mass of the   Earth is 5.9 sextillion tonnes: that's 59 followed by 20 zeroes.</p>
  <p>There's no sign of anything that massive at the surface.</p>
  <p>&quot;The   density of the material at the Earth's surface is much lower than the   average density of the whole Earth, so that tells us there's something   much denser,&quot; says Redfern. &quot;That's the first thing.&quot;</p>
  <p>Essentially,   most of the Earth's mass must be located towards the centre of the   planet. The next step is to ask which heavy materials make up the core.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The answer here is that it's almost certainly   made mostly of iron. The core is thought to be around 80% iron, though   the exact figure is up for debate.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> An iron core would account for all that missing mass </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   main evidence for this is the huge amount of iron in the universe   around us. It is one of the ten most common elements in our galaxy, and   is frequently found in meteorites.</p>
  <p>Given how much there is of it,   iron is much less common at the surface of the Earth than we might   expect. So the theory is that when Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, a   lot of iron worked its way down to the core.</p>
  <p>That's where most of   the mass is, and it's where most of the iron must be too. Iron is a   relatively dense element under normal conditions, and under the extreme   pressure at the Earth's core it would be crushed to an even higher   density, so an iron core would account for all that missing mass.</p>
  <p>But wait a minute. How did that iron get down there in the first place?</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The iron must have somehow gravitated – literally – towards the centre of the Earth. But it's not immediately obvious how.</p>
  <p>Most   of the rest of the Earth is made up of rocks called silicates, and   molten iron struggles to travel through them. Rather like how water on a   greasy surface forms droplets, the iron clings to itself in little   reservoirs, refusing to spread out and flow.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The pressure actually changes the properties of how iron interacts with the silicate </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24454138">A possible solution was discovered in 2013</a> by <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/wendy-mao">Wendy Mao</a> of Stanford University in California and her colleagues. They wondered   what happened when the iron and silicate were both exposed to extreme   pressure, as happens deep in the earth.</p>
  <p>By pinching both substances extremely tightly using diamonds, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1956">they were able to force molten iron through silicate</a>.</p>
  <p>&quot;The   pressure actually changes the properties of how iron interacts with the   silicate,&quot; says Mao. &quot;At higher pressures a 'melt network' is formed.&quot;</p>
  <p>This   suggests the iron was gradually squeezed down through the rocks of the   Earth over millions of years, until it reached the core.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At this point you might be wondering how we know   the size of the core. What makes scientists think it begins 3000km   down? There's a one-word answer: seismology.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> All the seismic stations dotted all over the Earth recorded the arrival of the tremors </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When   an earthquake happens, it sends shockwaves throughout the planet.   Seismologists record these vibrations. It's as if we hit one side of the   planet with a gigantic hammer, and listened on the other side for the   noise.</p>
  <p>&quot;There was a Chilean earthquake in the 1960s that generated   a huge amount of data,&quot; says Redfern. &quot;All the seismic stations dotted   all over the Earth recorded the arrival of the tremors from that   earthquake.&quot;</p>
  <p>Depending on the route those vibrations take, they   pass through different bits of the Earth, and this affects how they   &quot;sound&quot; at the other end.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Early in the history of seismology, it was   realised that some vibrations were going missing. These &quot;S-waves&quot; were   expected to show up on one side of the Earth after originating on the   other, but there was no sign of them.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It turned out that rocks became liquid around 3000km down </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The reason for this was simple. S-waves can only reverberate through solid material, and can't make it through liquid.</p>
  <p>They   must have come up against something molten in the centre of the Earth.   By mapping the S-waves' paths, it turned out that rocks became liquid   around 3000km down.</p>
  <p>That suggested the entire core was molten. But seismology had another surprise in store.</p>

  <p>In the 1930s, a Danish seismologist named <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8595157/inge-lehmann">Inge Lehmann</a> noticed that another kind of waves, called P-waves, unexpectedly   travelled through the core and could be detected on the other side of   the planet.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> P-waves really were travelling through the core </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>She   came up with a surprising explanation: the core is divided into two   layers. The &quot;inner&quot; core, which begins around 5,000km down, was actually   solid. It was only the &quot;outer&quot; core above it that was molten.</p>
  <p>Lehmann's   idea was eventually confirmed in 1970, when more sensitive seismographs   found that P-waves really were travelling through the core and, in some   cases, being deflected off it at angles. Sure enough, they still ended   up on the other side of the planet.</p>
  <p>It's not just earthquakes that   sent useful shockwaves through the Earth. In fact, seismology owes a   lot of its success to the development of nuclear weapons.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A nuclear detonation also creates waves in the   ground, so nations use seismology to listen out for weapons tests.   During the Cold War this was seen as hugely important, so seismologists   like Lehmann got a lot of encouragement.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> This turns out to be quite tricky to determine </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Rival   countries found out about each other's nuclear capabilities and along   the way we learned more and more about the core of the Earth. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-north-korea-seismic-activity-detected-near-nuclear-test-site/2013/02/11/1fcf0e4a-74c9-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">Seismology is still used to detect nuclear detonations today</a>.</p>
  <p>We   can now draw a rough picture of the Earth's structure. There is a   molten outer core, which begins roughly halfway to the planet's centre,   and within it is the solid inner core with a diameter of 1,220 km.</p>
  <p>But there is a lot more to try and tease out, especially about the inner core. For starters, how hot is it?</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This turns out to be quite tricky to determine, and baffled scientists until quite recently, says <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/staff/academic/vocadlo">Lidunka Vočadlo</a> of University College London in the UK. We can't put a thermometer down   there, so the only solution is to create the correct crushing pressure   in the lab.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Earth's core has stayed warm thanks to heat retained from the formation of the planet </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In 2013 a team of French researchers produced the best estimate to date. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1233514">They subjected pure iron to pressures a little over half that at the core</a>, and extrapolated from there. They concluded that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22297915">the melting point of pure iron at core temperatures is around 6,230 °C</a>.   The presence of other materials would bring the core's melting point   down a bit, to around 6,000 °C. But that's still as hot as the surface   of the Sun.</p>
  <p>A bit like a toasty jacket potato, Earth's core has   stayed warm thanks to heat retained from the formation of the planet. It   also gets heat from friction as denser materials shift around, as well   as from the decay of radioactive elements. Still, it is cooling by about   100 °C every billion years.</p>
  <p>Knowing the temperature is useful,   because it affects the speed at which vibrations travel through the   core. That is handy, because there is something odd about the   vibrations.</p>

  <p>P-waves travel unexpectedly slowly as they go through the inner core – slower than they would if it was made of pure iron.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It's a Cinderella problem: no shoe will quite fit </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Wave   velocities that the seismologists measure in earthquakes and whatnot   are significantly lower [than] anything that we measure in an experiment   or calculate on a computer,&quot; says Vočadlo. &quot;Nobody as yet knows why   that is.&quot;</p>
  <p>That suggests there is another material in the mix.</p>
  <p>It   could well be another metal, called nickel. But scientists have   estimated how seismic waves would travel through an iron-nickel alloy,   and it doesn't quite fit the readings either.</p>

  <p>Vočadlo and her colleagues are now considering   whether there might be other elements down there too, like sulphur and   silicon. So far, no-one has been able to come up with a theory for the   inner core's composition that satisfies everyone. It's a Cinderella   problem: no shoe will quite fit.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> That could explain why the seismic waves pass through more slowly than expected </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Vočadlo   is trying to simulate the materials of the inner core on a computer.   She hopes to find a combination of materials, temperatures and pressures   that would slow down the seismic waves by the right amount.</p>
  <p>She   says the secret might lie in the fact that the inner core is nearly at   its melting point. As a result, the precise properties of the materials   might be different from what they would be if they were safely solid.</p>
  <p>That could explain why the seismic waves pass through more slowly than expected.</p>
  <p>&quot;If   that's the real effect, we would be able to reconcile the mineral   physics results with the seismological results,&quot; says Vocadlo. &quot;People   have not been able to do that yet.&quot;</p>

  <p>There are plenty of riddles about the earth's   core still to solve. But without ever digging to those impossible   depths, scientists have figured out a great deal about what is happening   thousands of kilometres beneath us.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The magnetic field helps to shield us from harmful solar radiation </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those hidden processes in the depths of the Earth are crucial to our daily lives, in a way many of us don't realise.</p>
  <p>Earth has a powerful magnetic field, and that is all thanks to the partially molten core. The constant movement of molten iron <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/%7Ejs/glossary/dynamo_effect.html">creates an electrical current inside the planet</a>, and that in turn generates a magnetic field that reaches far out into space.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141110-earths-magnetic-field-flips-more">The magnetic field helps to shield us from harmful solar radiation</a>.   If the core of the Earth wasn't the way it is, there would be no   magnetic field, and we would have all sorts of problems to contend with.</p>
  <p>None of us will ever set eyes on the core, but it's good to know it's there.</p>
