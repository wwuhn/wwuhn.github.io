how will the universe end</p>
<p>Science has outlined four ways that our universe could meet its doom.   They're called the Big Freeze, the Big Crunch, the Big Change and the   Big Rip.</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>By Adam Becker</li>
  </ul>
  2 June 2015 </div>
<div>
  <p>Don't panic, but our planet is doomed. It's just going to take a while. Roughly 6 billion years from now, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150323-how-long-will-life-on-earth-last">the Earth will probably be vaporized when the dying Sun expands into a red giant and engulfs our planet</a>.</p>
  <p>But   the Earth is just one planet in the solar system, the Sun is just one   of hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy, and there are hundreds   of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. What's in store for   all of that? How does the universe end?</p>
  <p>The science is much less   settled on how that will happen. We're not even sure if the universe   will come to a firm, defined end, or just slowly tail off. Our best   understanding of physics suggests there are several options for the   universal apocalypse. It also offers some hints on how we might, just   maybe, survive it.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Our first clue to the end of the universe comes from   thermodynamics, the study of heat. Thermodynamics is the wild-eyed   street preacher of physics, bearing a cardboard placard with a simple   warning: &quot;THE HEAT DEATH IS COMING&quot;.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The heat death is far worse than being burnt to a crisp </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Despite the name, the heat death of the universe isn't a fiery inferno. Instead, it's the death of all differences in heat.</p>
  <p>This   may not sound scary, but the heat death is far worse than being burnt   to a crisp. That's because nearly everything in everyday life requires   some kind of temperature difference, either directly or indirectly.</p>
  <p>For   instance, your car runs because it's hotter inside its engine than   outside. Your computer runs on electricity from the local power plant,   which probably works by heating water and using that to power a turbine.   And you run on food, which exists thanks to the enormous temperature   difference between the Sun and the rest of the universe.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>However, once the universe reaches heat death,   everything everywhere will be the same temperature. That means nothing   interesting will ever happen again.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Heat death looked like the only possible way the universe could end </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Every   star will die, nearly all matter will decay, and eventually all that   will be left is a sparse soup of particles and radiation. Even the   energy of that soup will be sapped away over time by the expansion of   the universe, leaving everything just a fraction of a degree above   absolute zero.</p>
  <p>In this &quot;Big Freeze&quot;, the universe ends up uniformly cold, dead and empty.</p>
  <p>After   the development of thermodynamics in the early 1800s, heat death looked   like the only possible way the universe could end. But 100 years ago,   Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity suggested that the   universe had a far more dramatic fate.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>General relativity says that matter and energy warp   space and time. This relationship between space-time and matter-energy   (stuff) — between the stage and the actors on it — extends to the entire   universe. The stuff in the universe, according to Einstein, determines   the ultimate fate of the universe itself.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The universe began as something incredibly small, and then expanded incredibly quickly </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   theory predicted that the universe as a whole must either be expanding   or contracting. It could not stay the same size. Einstein realized this   in 1917, and was so reluctant to believe it that he fudged his own   theory.</p>
  <p>Then in 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble found   hard evidence that the universe was expanding. Einstein changed his   mind, calling his previous insistence on a static universe the &quot;greatest   blunder&quot; of his career.</p>
  <p>If the universe is expanding, it must   once have been much smaller than it is now. This realization led to the   Big Bang theory: the idea that the universe began as something   incredibly small, and then expanded incredibly quickly. We can see the   &quot;afterglow&quot; of the Big Bang even today, in the cosmic microwave   background radiation – a constant stream of radio waves, coming from all   directions in the sky.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The fate of the universe, then, hinges on a very simple question: will the universe continue to expand, and how quickly?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> If there's too much stuff, the expansion of the universe will slow down and stop </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For   a universe containing normal &quot;stuff&quot;, such as matter and light, the   answer to this question depends on how much stuff there is. More stuff   means more gravity, which pulls everything back together and slows the   expansion.</p>
  <p>As long as the amount of stuff doesn't go over a   critical threshold, the universe will continue to expand forever, and   eventually suffer heat death, freezing out.</p>
  <p>But if there's too   much stuff, the expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. Then   the universe will begin to contract. A contracting universe will shrink   smaller and smaller, getting hotter and denser, eventually ending in a   fabulously compact inferno, a sort of reverse Big Bang known as the Big   Crunch.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>For most of the 20th century, astrophysicists   weren't sure which of these scenarios would play out. Would it be the   Big Freeze or the Big Crunch? Ice or fire?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Dark energy pulls the universe apart </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They   tried to perform a cosmic census, adding up how much stuff there is in   our universe. It turned out that we're strangely close to the critical   threshold, leaving our fate uncertain.</p>
  <p>That all changed at the end   of the 20th century. In 1998, two competing teams of astrophysicists   made an astonishing announcement: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/300499">the expansion of the universe</a> is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/307221">speeding up</a>.</p>
  <p>Normal   matter and energy can't make the universe behave this way. This was the   first evidence of a fundamentally new kind of energy, dubbed &quot;dark   energy&quot;, which didn't behave like anything else in the cosmos.</p>
  <p>Dark   energy pulls the universe apart. We still don't understand what it is,   but roughly 70% of the energy in the universe is dark energy, and that   number is growing every day.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The existence of dark energy means that the amount of stuff in the universe doesn't get to determine its ultimate fate.</p>
  <p>Instead,   dark energy controls the cosmos, accelerating the expansion of the   universe for all time. This makes the Big Crunch much less likely.</p>
  <p>But that doesn't mean that the Big Freeze is inevitable. There are other possibilities.</p>
  <p>One   of them originated, not in the study of the cosmos, but in the world of   subatomic particles. This is perhaps the strangest fate for the   universe. It sounds like something out of science fiction, and in a way,   it is.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>In Kurt Vonnegut's classic sci-fi novel <em>Cat's Cradle</em>,   ice-nine is a new form of water ice with a remarkable property: it   freezes at 46 °C, not at 0 °C. When a crystal of ice-nine is dropped   into a glass of water, all the water around it immediately patterns   itself after the crystal, since it has lower energy than liquid water.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> There's nowhere for the ice to start forming </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   new crystals of ice-nine do the same thing to the water around them,   and in the blink of an eye, the chain reaction turns all the water in   the glass — or (spoiler alert!) all of Earth's oceans — into solid   ice-nine.</p>
  <p>The same thing can happen in real life with normal ice   and normal water. If you put very pure water into a very clean glass,   and cool it just below 0°C, the water will become supercooled: it stays   liquid below its natural freezing point. There are no impurities in the   water and no rough patches on the glass, so there's nowhere for the ice   to start forming. But if you drop a crystal of ice into the glass, the   water will freeze rapidly, just like ice-nine.</p>
  <p>Ice-nine and   supercooled water may not seem relevant to the fate of the universe. But   something similar could happen to space itself.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Quantum physics dictates that even in a totally   empty vacuum, there is a small amount of energy. But there might also be   some other kind of vacuum, which holds less energy.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The new vacuum will &quot;convert&quot; the old vacuum around it </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If   that's true, then the entire universe is like a glass of supercooled   water. It will only last until a &quot;bubble&quot; of lower-energy vacuum shows   up.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, there are no such bubbles that we're aware of.   Unfortunately, quantum physics also dictates that if a lower-energy   vacuum is possible, then a bubble of that vacuum will inevitably dart   into existence somewhere in the universe.</p>
  <p>When that happens, just   like ice-nine, the new vacuum will &quot;convert&quot; the old vacuum around it.   The bubble would expand at nearly the speed of light, so we'd never see   it coming.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Inside the bubble, things would be radically different, and not terribly hospitable.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Humans, planets and even the stars themselves would be destroyed </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   properties of fundamental particles like electrons and quarks could be   entirely different, radically rewriting the rules of chemistry and   perhaps preventing atoms from forming.</p>
  <p>Humans, planets and even   the stars themselves would be destroyed in this Big Change. In a 1980   paper, Physicists Sidney Coleman and Frank de Luccia called it &quot;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.21.3305">the ultimate ecological catastrophe</a>&quot;.</p>
  <p>Adding   insult to injury, dark energy would probably behave differently after   the Big Change. Rather than driving the universe to expand faster, dark   energy might instead pull the universe in on itself, collapsing into a   Big Crunch.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>There is a fourth possibility, and once again dark   energy is at centre stage. This idea is very speculative and unlikely,   but it can't yet be ruled out. Dark energy might be even more powerful   than we thought, and might be enough to end the universe on its own,   without any intervening Big Change, Freeze, or Crunch.</p>
  <p>Dark energy   has a peculiar property. As the universe expands, its density remains   constant. That means more of it pops into existence over time, to keep   pace with the increasing volume of the universe. This is unusual, <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/">but doesn't break any laws of physics</a>.</p>
  <p>However,   it could get weirder. What if the density of dark energy increases as   the universe expands? In other words, what if the amount of dark energy   in the universe increases more quickly than the expansion of the   universe itself?</p>
  <p>This idea was put forward by <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecaldwell/cosmology/Dartmouth_College_Physics_%26_Astronomy.html">Robert Caldwell</a> of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He calls it &quot;phantom   dark energy&quot;. It leads to a remarkably strange fate for the universe.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>If phantom dark energy exists, then the dark side is our ultimate downfall, just like <em>Star Wars</em> warned us it would be.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Atoms themselves would shatter, a fraction of a second before the universe itself ripped apart </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Right   now, the density of dark energy is very low, far less than the density   of matter here on Earth, or even the density of the Milky Way galaxy,   which is much less dense than Earth. But as time goes on, the density of   phantom dark energy would build up, and tear the universe apart.</p>
  <p>In a 2003 paper, Caldwell and his colleagues outlined a scenario they called &quot;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301">cosmic doomsday</a>&quot;. Once the phantom dark energy becomes more dense than a particular object, that object gets torn to shreds.</p>
  <p>First,   phantom dark energy would pull the Milky Way apart, sending its   constituent stars flying. Then the solar system would be unbound,   because the pull of dark energy would be stronger than the pull of the   Sun on the Earth.</p>
  <p>Finally, in a few frantic minutes the Earth   would explode. Then atoms themselves would shatter, a fraction of a   second before the universe itself ripped apart. Caldwell calls this the   Big Rip.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The Big Rip is, by Caldwell's own admission, &quot;very   outlandish&quot; – and not just because it sounds like something out of an   over-the-top superhero comic.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> This is a remarkably grim portrait of the future </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Phantom   dark energy flies in the face of some fairly basic ideas about the   universe, like the assumption that matter and energy can't go faster   than the speed of light. There are good reasons not to believe in it.</p>
  <p>Based   on our observations of the expansion of the universe, and particle   physics experiments, it seems much more likely that the ultimate fate of   our universe is a Big Freeze, possibly followed by a Big Change and a   final Big Crunch.</p>
  <p>But this is a remarkably grim portrait of the   future — aeons of cold emptiness, finally terminated by a vacuum decay   and a final implosion into nothingness. Is there any escape? Or are we   doomed to book a table at <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Milliways">the Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a>?</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>There's certainly no reason for us, individually, to   worry about the end of the universe. All of these events are trillions   of years into the future, with the possible exception of the Big Change,   so they're not exactly an imminent problem.</p>
  <p>Also, there's no   reason to worry about humanity. If nothing else, genetic drift will have   rendered our descendants unrecognizable long before then. But could   intelligent feeling creatures of any kind, human or not, survive?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> If the universe is accelerating, that's really bad news </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Physicist <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson">Freeman Dyson</a> of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey considered this question in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447">a classic paper published in 1979</a>.   At the time, he concluded that life could modify itself to survive the   Big Freeze, which he thought was less challenging than the inferno of   the Big Crunch.</p>
  <p>But these days, he's much less optimistic, thanks to the discovery of dark energy.</p>
  <p>&quot;If   the universe is accelerating, that's really bad news,&quot; says Dyson.   Accelerating expansion means we'll eventually lose contact with all but a   handful of galaxies, dramatically limiting the amount of energy   available to us. &quot;It's a rather dismal situation in the long run.&quot;</p>
  <p>The   situation could still change. &quot;We really don't know whether the   expansion is going to continue since we don't understand why it's   accelerating,&quot; says Dyson. &quot;The optimistic view is that the acceleration   will slow down as the universe gets bigger.&quot; If that happens, &quot;the   future is much more promising.&quot;</p>
  <p>But what if the expansion doesn't   slow down, or if it becomes clear that the Big Change is coming? Some   physicists have proposed a solution that is solidly in mad-scientist   territory. To escape the end of the universe, we should build our own   universe in a laboratory, and jump in.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>One physicist who has worked on this idea is <a href="http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/guth_alan.html">Alan Guth</a> of MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is known for his work on the very early universe.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> You would jump-start the creation of an entirely new universe </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;I   can't say that the laws of physics absolutely imply that it's   possible,&quot; says Guth. &quot;If it is possible, it would require technology   vastly beyond anything that we can foresee. It would require huge   amounts of energy that one would need to be able to obtain and control.&quot;</p>
  <p>The first step, according to Guth, would be creating an incredibly dense form of matter — so dense that it was on the verge of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150525-a-black-hole-would-clone-you">collapsing into a black hole</a>.   By doing that in the right way, and then quickly clearing the matter   out of the area, you might be able to force that region of space to   start expanding rapidly.</p>
  <p>In effect, you would jump-start the   creation of an entirely new universe. As the space in the region   expanded, the boundary would shrink, creating a bubble of warped space   where the inside was bigger than the outside.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>That may sound familiar to <em>Doctor Who</em> fans,   and according to Guth, the TARDIS is &quot;probably a very accurate analogy&quot;   for the kind of warping of space he's talking about.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> We don't really know if it's possible or not </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Eventually,   the outside would shrink to nothingness, and the new baby universe   would pinch off from our own, spared from whatever fate our universe may   meet.</p>
  <p>It's far from certain that this scheme would actually work.   &quot;I would have to say that it's unclear,&quot; says Guth. &quot;We don't really   know if it's possible or not.&quot;</p>
  <p>However, Guth also points out that there is another source of hope beyond the end of the universe – well, hope of a sort.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Guth was the first to propose that the very early   universe expanded astonishingly fast for a tiny fraction of a second, an   idea known as &quot;inflation&quot;. Many cosmologists now believe inflation is   the most promising approach for explaining the early universe, and   Guth's plan for creating a new universe relies on recreating this rapid   expansion.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The multiverse as a whole is genuinely eternal </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Inflation   has an intriguing consequence for the ultimate fate of the universe.   The theory dictates that the universe we inhabit is just one small part   of a multiverse, with an eternally inflating background continually   spawning &quot;pocket universes&quot; like our own.</p>
  <p>&quot;If that's the case,   even if we're convinced that an individual pocket universe will   ultimately die through refrigeration, the multiverse as a whole will go   on living forever, with new life being created in each pocket universe   as it's created,&quot; says Guth. &quot;In this picture, the multiverse as a whole   is genuinely eternal, at least eternal into the future, even as   individual pocket universes live and die.&quot;</p>
  <p>In other words, Franz   Kafka may have been right on the money when he said that there is   &quot;plenty of hope, an infinite amount of hope—but not for us.&quot;</p>
  <p>This is a bit of a bleak thought. If it upsets you, here is a picture of a cute kitten.</p>
